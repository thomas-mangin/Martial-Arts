what

22
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
what
 

23
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,990
what
i found is

24
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
i found is
 

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,470
i found is
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit

26
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit
 

27
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,790
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get
 

29
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,110
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get
this big lump through here

30
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
this big lump through here
 

31
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,990
this big lump through here
so

32
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
so
 

33
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,910
so
i'm not very elegant of that

34
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
i'm not very elegant of that
 

35
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,990
i'm not very elegant of that
so i need a little more space

36
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
so i need a little more space
 

37
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,950
so i need a little more space
so this is for the for the hakama

when he comes here i'm going to push him
to the stage without him knowing it

42
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760

 

43
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,549

to give me a bit more space

44
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,670
to give me a bit more space
it

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
it
 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,670
it
it's not so much pushing him as it's

48
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
it's not so much pushing him as it's
 

49
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,350
it's not so much pushing him as it's
holding him off

50
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
holding him off
 

51
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,630
