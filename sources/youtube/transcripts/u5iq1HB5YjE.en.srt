have to make these big gross movements
 

139
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,190
have to make these big gross movements
then it's not going to it's not ideal

140
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
then it's not going to it's not ideal
 

141
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,149
then it's not going to it's not ideal
okay so let's say he's pushing on me

right and as I'm working that same body
 

145
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,789
right and as I'm working that same body
it's it's already on which I won't do

on you don't have to do these big
 

157
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,629
on you don't have to do these big
movements save that for when it counts

158
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
movements save that for when it counts
 

159
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,509
movements save that for when it counts
okay but when you're idealized
