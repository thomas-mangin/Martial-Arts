not up here

66
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
not up here
 

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,630
not up here
you pay attention because because she's

68
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
you pay attention because because she's
 

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,970
you pay attention because because she's
pushing her her core will lock on her

70
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:31,980
pushing her her core will lock on her
 

71
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,110
pushing her her core will lock on her
okay but if I push at the top of this it

72
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
okay but if I push at the top of this it
 

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,970
okay but if I push at the top of this it
kind of just tilts her

74
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
kind of just tilts her
 

75
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,330
kind of just tilts her
you see well once I go into her Center

76
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,340
you see well once I go into her Center
 

77
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,430
you see well once I go into her Center
you'll see that the pelvis kind of cage

78
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
you'll see that the pelvis kind of cage
 

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,250
you'll see that the pelvis kind of cage
like that you see that the case like

80
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,260
like that you see that the case like
 

81
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,110
like that you see that the case like
that and if you can't see it you can get

82
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,120
that and if you can't see it you can get
 

83
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,410
that and if you can't see it you can get
closer over here maybe even this angle

84
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,420
closer over here maybe even this angle
 

85
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,110
closer over here maybe even this angle
you can see their Bells

86
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
you can see their Bells
 

87
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,970
you can see their Bells
for development

88
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
for development
 

89
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,550
for development
so here she's locked because that's what

90
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
so here she's locked because that's what
 

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,190
so here she's locked because that's what
happens when you try to be strong if I

92
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
happens when you try to be strong if I
 

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,350
happens when you try to be strong if I
just push the top on this lever it just

94
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
just push the top on this lever it just
 

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,790
just push the top on this lever it just
tilts her

96
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
tilts her
 

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,970
tilts her
but I want to go into that center right

98
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:07,980
but I want to go into that center right
 

99
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,369
but I want to go into that center right
there

100
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:10,379

 

101
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,910

there so here it is from the angle you

102
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
there so here it is from the angle you
 

103
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,589
there so here it is from the angle you
see it kind of turns straight in

104
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:18,599

 

105
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,930

from the angle trying to use

106
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,940
from the angle trying to use
 

107
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,110
from the angle trying to use
so that that'll always happen

108
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,120
so that that'll always happen
 

109
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,149
so that that'll always happen
as I do this row

110
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
as I do this row
 

111
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,630
as I do this row
even when it looks like I'm

112
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
even when it looks like I'm
 

113
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,490
even when it looks like I'm
I'm going in her shoulder you should

114
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm going in her shoulder you should
 

115
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,390
I'm going in her shoulder you should
always there it is right there

116
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400

 

117
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,229

it is right there so for me it's like I

118
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
it is right there so for me it's like I
 

119
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,649
it is right there so for me it's like I
didn't did it did it

120
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:42,659
didn't did it did it
 

121
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,729
didn't did it did it
did it did it undid it did it this is

122
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:48,739
did it did it undid it did it this is
 

123
00:03:48,739 --> 00:04:04,369
did it did it undid it did it this is
just arm wrestling

124
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:04,379

 

125
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,490

and because that's my only goal

126
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,500
and because that's my only goal
 

127
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,729
and because that's my only goal
it doesn't matter what I do with my arms

128
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:10,739
it doesn't matter what I do with my arms
 

129
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:19,270
it doesn't matter what I do with my arms
do you see

130
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280

 

131
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,150

so I don't have to do the keyhole

132
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160

 

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,249

do you understand

134
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:28,259
do you understand
 

135
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,189
do you understand
but if I was to do the kihon it's the

136
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
but if I was to do the kihon it's the
 

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,210
but if I was to do the kihon it's the
same way into this thing

138
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
same way into this thing
 

139
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,710
same way into this thing
into the set not out it's called

140
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
into the set not out it's called
 

141
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,170
into the set not out it's called
not up top

142
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,180
not up top
 

143
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,730
not up top
does that make sense

144
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
does that make sense
 

145
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,590
does that make sense
right okay

146
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
right okay
 

147
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,830
right okay
Let's uh

148
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840

 

149
00:04:48,840 --> 00:05:19,730

aim differently

150
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:19,740

 

151
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,710

okay

152
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:21,720
okay
 

153
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,249
okay
so again

154
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:25,259

 

155
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,529

to do a drill

156
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:27,539
to do a drill
 

157
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,469
to do a drill
you have to follow the prescriptions

158
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:29,479
you have to follow the prescriptions
 

159
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,090
you have to follow the prescriptions
just like if I'm going to do bench press

160
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,100

 

161
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,270

my bar is prescribed not to bend or

162
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,280
my bar is prescribed not to bend or
 

163
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,650
my bar is prescribed not to bend or
break the barbell do you see

164
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:42,660

 

165
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,529

oh if I start doing something outside

166
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:45,539
oh if I start doing something outside
 

167
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,870
oh if I start doing something outside
the prescription I can't do the drill

168
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:47,880
the prescription I can't do the drill
 

169
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,210
the prescription I can't do the drill
then I cannot get the desired effect

170
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,220
then I cannot get the desired effect
 

171
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,070
then I cannot get the desired effect
from Drilling

172
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
from Drilling
 

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,650
from Drilling
okay now there's all kinds of things

174
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:54,660
okay now there's all kinds of things
 

175
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,189
okay now there's all kinds of things

220
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
momentum to the projection do you see
 

221
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,029
momentum to the projection do you see
okay

222
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,039
okay
 

223
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,090
okay
uh this one is very subtle but it is

224
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,100
uh this one is very subtle but it is
 

225
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,450
uh this one is very subtle but it is
there okay so you do the initial Yong

226
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,460
there okay so you do the initial Yong
 

227
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,570
there okay so you do the initial Yong
push but as soon as you feel

228
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:17,580
push but as soon as you feel
 

229
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,629

your Center you just you you stop you

230
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
start yielding do you understand
 

233
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,890
start yielding do you understand
um

234
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:24,900
um
 

235
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,309
um
and that's creating a false success

236
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
and that's creating a false success
 

237
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,930
and that's creating a false success
okay

238
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:29,940
okay
 

239
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,189
okay
so

240
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
so
 

241
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,589
so
and again this is why you need a teacher

242
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
and again this is why you need a teacher
 

243
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,230
and again this is why you need a teacher
because that looks that looks

244
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
because that looks that looks
 

245
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,870
because that looks that looks
close didn't it you're making his Center

246
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880

247
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,710
close didn't it you're making his Center
move I see that but a teacher can tell

248
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
move I see that but a teacher can tell
 

249
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,230
move I see that but a teacher can tell
that from the way your whole body was

250
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,240
that from the way your whole body was
 

251
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,710
that from the way your whole body was
organized that

252
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:47,720
organized that
 

253
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,930
organized that
you you wouldn't even have the ability

254
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:50,940
you you wouldn't even have the ability
 

255
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,350
you you wouldn't even have the ability

256
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,360
to project that that Center that he took

to project that that Center that he took
away the prescribed young energy

258
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580

remember how Virginia remained locked

260
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,120
remember how Virginia remained locked
 

261
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,469
remember how Virginia remained locked
do you think she hence when I pushed on

262
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:03,479
do you think she hence when I pushed on
 

263
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,790
do you think she hence when I pushed on
her shoulders she just tilted see

264
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
her shoulders she just tilted see
 

265
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,129
her shoulders she just tilted see
um had she not remained locked when you

266
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:10,139
um had she not remained locked when you
 

267
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,529
um had she not remained locked when you
push on my shoulders right her knees

268
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:12,539
push on my shoulders right her knees
 

269
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,129
push on my shoulders right her knees
would have stayed down

270
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:16,139

 

271
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,909

so what happens is you go as as I feel

272
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
so what happens is you go as as I feel
 

273
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,629
so what happens is you go as as I feel
you trying to get in my Center then I

274
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
you trying to get in my Center then I
 

275
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,650
you trying to get in my Center then I
disengage the center you see that so the

276
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,660
disengage the center you see that so the
 

277
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,570
disengage the center you see that so the
teacher could say that this posture

278
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,580
teacher could say that this posture
 

279
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,350
teacher could say that this posture
and the vectors that she attempted to go

280
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,360
and the vectors that she attempted to go
 

281
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,930
and the vectors that she attempted to go
into your Center

282
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:37,940
into your Center
 

283
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,389
into your Center
uh are not truly viable

284
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:41,399
uh are not truly viable
 

285
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,949
uh are not truly viable
so if I just continue the prescription

286
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:45,959
so if I just continue the prescription
 

287
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,710
so if I just continue the prescription
instead of when I feel her

288
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
instead of when I feel her
 

289
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,470
instead of when I feel her
do you see a virus continue the

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:51,480
do you see a virus continue the
 

291
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,710
do you see a virus continue the
prescription

292
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720

 

293
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,810

so none of this is going in the ground

294
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:56,820
so none of this is going in the ground
 

295
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,769
so none of this is going in the ground
so

296
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:57,779
so
 

297
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,470
so
you were going to prolong it okay I'm

298
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
you were going to prolong it okay I'm
 

299
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,970
you were going to prolong it okay I'm
I'm just matching your young energy okay

300
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:03,980

just stay here

302
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:09,740

 

303
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,230

what is happening

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
what is happening
 

305
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,870
what is happening
but you're not going okay what else do

306
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
but you're not going okay what else do
 

307
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,970
but you're not going okay what else do
you feel in your body uh tension in my

308
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:16,980
you feel in your body uh tension in my
 

309
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,030
you feel in your body uh tension in my
arm s okay okay do you feel I'm just

310
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
arm s okay okay do you feel I'm just
 

311
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,670

matching your energy

312
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
matching your energy
 

313
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,130

do you feel the fatigue setting yes do

314
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,140
do you feel the fatigue setting yes do
 

315
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,009
do you feel the fatigue setting yes do
you see so we stay here forever I'm

316
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:28,019
you see so we stay here forever I'm
 

317
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,470
you see so we stay here forever I'm
going to be here for forever so I just

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,410
basically doing
deltoid bicep and you see that you're

324
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
deltoid bicep and you see that you're
 

325
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,110
deltoid bicep and you see that you're
going into a fatigue State I see that

326
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120

 

327
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,329

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,750
but we're now not doing the drill
when we get false positives

512
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:20,760
when we get false positives
 

513
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,030
when we get false positives
okay that's why you need the teacher but

514
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
okay that's why you need the teacher but
 

515
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,090
okay that's why you need the teacher but
the weak Link in the system is you have

516
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100
the weak Link in the system is you have
 

517
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,490
the weak Link in the system is you have
to do what the teacher says even against

518
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
to do what the teacher says even against
 

519
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,230
to do what the teacher says even against
your instincts

520
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
your instincts
 

521
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,629
your instincts

your instincts are fear-based at this
 

523
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,269
your instincts are fear-based at this
point do you understand

524
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279

 

525
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,910

externally

540
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:03,720
externally
 

541
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,269
externally
holding up

542
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
holding up
 

543
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,189
holding up
no

544
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
no
 

545
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,129
no
what happened is this had moved towards

546
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:10,139
what happened is this had moved towards
 

547
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,769
what happened is this had moved towards
her and her Center didn't move oh okay

548
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:12,779
her and her Center didn't move oh okay
 

549
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,689
her and her Center didn't move oh okay
do you see that which means you're

550
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:14,699
do you see that which means you're
 

551
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,670
do you see that which means you're
external you're not in her Center do you

552
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:16,680
external you're not in her Center do you
 

553
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,090
external you're not in her Center do you
see that flip-floppy yes okay

554
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,100
see that flip-floppy yes okay
 

555
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,150
see that flip-floppy yes okay
we just do this so you see this this

556
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,160
we just do this so you see this this
 

557
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,030
we just do this so you see this this
part can you see that

558
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,040
part can you see that
 

559
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,710
part can you see that
so

560
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:27,720
so
 

561
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,710
so
this has to

562
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
this has to
 

563
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,670
this has to
uh stay here but go there

564
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,680
uh stay here but go there
 

565
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,790
uh stay here but go there
you understand so I you were first in

566
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
you understand so I you were first in
 

567
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,750
you understand so I you were first in
the before we filmed you were materially

568
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:40,760
the before we filmed you were materially
 

569
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,750
the before we filmed you were materially
conceiving that you push here

570
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:44,760
conceiving that you push here
 

571
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,290
conceiving that you push here
scene but you have stopped the

572
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,300
scene but you have stopped the
 

573
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,750
scene but you have stopped the
prescription you're no longer engaged in

574
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:50,760
prescription you're no longer engaged in
 

575
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,769
prescription you're no longer engaged in
pushing do you see that okay so if you

576
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:54,779
pushing do you see that okay so if you
 

577
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,470
pushing do you see that okay so if you
keep that pushing and I do what you did

578
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
keep that pushing and I do what you did
 

579
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,150
keep that pushing and I do what you did
you'll be able to push my hand down if

580
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,160
you'll be able to push my hand down if
 

581
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,050
you'll be able to push my hand down if
you see

582
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,060
you see
 

583
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,370
you see
okay whereas if I keep the extension

584
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,380
okay whereas if I keep the extension
 

585
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,769
okay whereas if I keep the extension
and

586
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:06,779
and
 

587
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,370
and
you push down push down push down don't

588
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,380
you push down push down push down don't
 

589
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,689
you push down push down push down don't
disengage

590
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:11,699
disengage
 

591
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,189
disengage
yeah

592
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
yeah
 

593
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,629
yeah
push down

594
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
push down
 

595
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,170
push down
do you see now watch your body

596
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,180

 

597
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,750

so you your hand

598
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:23,760
so you your hand
 

599
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,449
so you your hand
was not able to get that Yin space which

600
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:26,459
was not able to get that Yin space which
 

601
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,269
was not able to get that Yin space which
it would always be able to do if I'm

602
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
it would always be able to do if I'm
 

603
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,730
it would always be able to do if I'm
just moving

604
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:31,740
just moving
 

605
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,370
just moving
your wrist you see that

606
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:34,380
your wrist you see that
 

607
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,249
your wrist you see that
so same thing happens here

608

so same thing happens here
even though I'm here I don't go

610
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:41,820
even though I'm here I don't go

and not here

620
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:58,259
and not here
 

621
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,430
and not here
or in this connection point

622
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
or in this connection point
 

623
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,590
or in this connection point
in your body

624
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600

 

625
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,610

here

626
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:13,620

 

627
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,829

the disengation stay at your wrist you

628
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
the disengation stay at your wrist you
 

629
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,949
the disengation stay at your wrist you
can shut down

630
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959

 

631
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,770

shut down all you want

632
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:26,780

 

633
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,190

look at your second

634
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200

 

635
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,530

okay you can do it you're shoving down

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:33,540
okay you can do it you're shoving down
 

637
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,470
okay you can do it you're shoving down
and you can do any

638
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,480

 

639
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,250

you can go the other way see your elbow

640
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,260

 

641
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,350

you're gonna take away all the chemical

642
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,360
you're gonna take away all the chemical
 

643
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,570
you're gonna take away all the chemical
dancing if you pay attention I do you

644
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:50,580
dancing if you pay attention I do you
 

645
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,090
dancing if you pay attention I do you
feel this way now so instead of leaving

646
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,100
feel this way now so instead of leaving
 

647
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,549
feel this way now so instead of leaving
this up

648
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:57,559

 

649
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,330

just flip

650
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,340
just flip
 

651
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,510
just flip
so flip

652
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520
so flip
 

653
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:12,470
so flip
for sure

654
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480

 

655
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,010

this angle should be more impossible

656
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,020
this angle should be more impossible
 

657
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,740
this angle should be more impossible
you see but no it's in your butt

658
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,750
you see but no it's in your butt
 

659
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:27,710
you see but no it's in your butt
[Music]

660
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:27,720

 

661
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,529

so if you're doing the kihon

662
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:30,539
so if you're doing the kihon
 

663
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,230
so if you're doing the kihon
once you got here what you're doing in

664
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
once you got here what you're doing in
 

665
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,390
once you got here what you're doing in
the keyhon is it it integrates the

666
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,400
the keyhon is it it integrates the
 

667
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,110
the keyhon is it it integrates the
external you see so you cannot push as

668
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
external you see so you cannot push as
 

669
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,090
external you see so you cannot push as
hard you see that

670
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,100
hard you see that
 

671
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,909
hard you see that
as opposed to your hair

672
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
as opposed to your hair
 

673
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,430
as opposed to your hair
you can push pretty dang hard right you

674
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,440
you can push pretty dang hard right you
 

675
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,750
you can push pretty dang hard right you
understand

676
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
understand
 

677
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,010
understand
so I combined

678
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,020
so I combined
 

679
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,950
so I combined
and integrate the external like put you

680
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
and integrate the external like put you
 

681
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,070
and integrate the external like put you
at a more mechanical disadvantage but I

682
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
at a more mechanical disadvantage but I
 

683
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,310
at a more mechanical disadvantage but I
don't want to go

684
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
