you should be able to train yourself so
that I can see where I am on the spot

78
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,420

Carter

88
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:07,799

 

89
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:16,309

I can learn to go from side to side

90
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319

 

91
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,190

and across the tape okay

93
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,630
and across the tape okay
so

94
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640

 

95
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,150

I've been doing this now for many many
 

199
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,810
I've been doing this now for many many
years and I've decided that it's okay

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:05,820
years and I've decided that it's okay
 

201
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,450
years and I've decided that it's okay
when you're doing it slowly and he

202
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,460
when you're doing it slowly and he
 

203
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,790
when you're doing it slowly and he
insisted that we count because he said

204
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
insisted that we count because he said
 

205
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,270
insisted that we count because he said
it was a 31 count Carter

206
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280
it was a 31 count Carter
 

207
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,090
it was a 31 count Carter
but I've found that it's very disrupting

208
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,100
but I've found that it's very disrupting
 

209
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,290
but I've found that it's very disrupting
when you're trying to do it at speed to

when you're trying to do it at speed to
 

211
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,370
when you're trying to do it at speed to

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,280
Carter
 

255
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,909
Carter
and what my advice is don't try to count

256
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
and what my advice is don't try to count
 

257
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:39,490
and what my advice is don't try to count
with it

258
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:39,500

 

259
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,670

you know because

260
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680

 

261
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,409

because at 12 it should be there 12 18

262
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,419
because at 12 it should be there 12 18
 

263
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,990
because at 12 it should be there 12 18
26 31.

264
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
26 31.
 

265
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,450
26 31.
I think that way you can put more power

266
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,460
I think that way you can put more power
 

267
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,270
I think that way you can put more power
into doing the Carter

268
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
into doing the Carter
 

269
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,909
into doing the Carter
and leave the county out just do the

270
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
and leave the county out just do the
 

271
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,370
and leave the county out just do the
counting when teaching and when doing it

272
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
counting when teaching and when doing it
 

273
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,809
counting when teaching and when doing it
broken down the stages

00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:08,819

 

275
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,230

always have some kind of marker if you

276
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
always have some kind of marker if you
 

277
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,450
always have some kind of marker if you
don't have

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,460
don't have

the cross will say the line and you end
 

285
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,450
the cross will say the line and you end
up being accurate

286
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
up being accurate
 

287
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,110
up being accurate
and you always know that you've worked

288
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
and you always know that you've worked

out
basically your your steps your footwork

292

basically your your steps your footwork
 

293
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,689
basically your your steps your footwork
then

294
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:32,699
then
 

295
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,610
then
you don't need to

you don't need to
 

297
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,830
you don't need to
I mean I never use the cost a little bit

teeth he said to have them fixed would
 

369
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,230
teeth he said to have them fixed would
be too much so he changed this part and

370
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
be too much so he changed this part and
 

371
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,430
be too much so he changed this part and
he made us

372
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
he made us
 

373
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,590
he made us
go backwards so instead of coming

374
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
go backwards so instead of coming
 

375
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,769
go backwards so instead of coming
forward

376
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:42,779

 

377
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,350

so they're coming forward striking the

378
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
so they're coming forward striking the

381
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:59,509

and then down to here

382
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519

 

383
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,269

we step back we still strike the head

384
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279

 

385
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,329

okay there's a weakness there that I see

don't hit the hands
and it starts dropping off really close

392
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:17,940
and it starts dropping off really close
 

393
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,110
and it starts dropping off really close
down here so it goes perhaps across the

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
down here so it goes perhaps across the
 

395
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,630
