right has this straight arm like that
that was not working for the technique

166
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:42,729

 

167
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:45,840

and that was brought about by

168
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:45,850
and that was brought about by
 

169
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,230
and that was brought about by
neutralizing the grip and going up the

170
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
neutralizing the grip and going up the
 

171
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,890
neutralizing the grip and going up the
elbow and you keep that action going you

172
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:53,900
elbow and you keep that action going you
 

173
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,250
elbow and you keep that action going you
see that then you'll have it here's

174
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,260
see that then you'll have it here's
 

175
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,870
see that then you'll have it here's
where you can reconcile that energy

176
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:03,880

 

177
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,550

elbow and move to keep this elbow

178
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
elbow and move to keep this elbow
 

179
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,400
elbow and move to keep this elbow
neutral so you're not pushing they're

180
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,410
neutral so you're not pushing they're
 

181
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,469
neutral so you're not pushing they're
pulling which means you don't step

182
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
pulling which means you don't step
 

183
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,010
pulling which means you don't step
wherever the grip is telling you so once

184
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,020
wherever the grip is telling you so once
 

185
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,469
wherever the grip is telling you so once
you put hands on it once I put hands on

186
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
you put hands on it once I put hands on
 

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,930
you put hands on it once I put hands on
it right I have two points of contact

188
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:22,940
it right I have two points of contact
 

189
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,050
it right I have two points of contact
that tell me where it's zero not plus

190
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,060
that tell me where it's zero not plus
 

191
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,170
that tell me where it's zero not plus
one push plus one pull so that's going

192
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,180
one push plus one pull so that's going
 

193
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,440
one push plus one pull so that's going
to tell me where I step to do this right

194
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,450
to tell me where I step to do this right
 

195
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,839
to tell me where I step to do this right
it's going to tell me exactly what I

196
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:34,849
it's going to tell me exactly what I
 

197
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:40,089
it's going to tell me exactly what I
need to go so I can't just have a

198
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:40,099
need to go so I can't just have a
 

199
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,580
need to go so I can't just have a
choreography in my head that goes I

200
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:42,590
choreography in my head that goes I
 

201
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,920
choreography in my head that goes I
always just step like that you see your

202
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:44,930
always just step like that you see your
 

203
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,900
always just step like that you see your
plus one pull so you have to wait for it

204
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:49,910
plus one pull so you have to wait for it
 

205
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,360
plus one pull so you have to wait for it
neutralize that grip then you don't tell

206
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,370
neutralize that grip then you don't tell
 

207
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,710

00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:12,949
the opposite problem alright there's
 

215
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,480
the opposite problem alright there's
stuff going on on the inside so when I

221
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,739
certain let's just let's go the inside
of the musculature level so I don't go

222
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:26,749
of the musculature level so I don't go
 

223

when I go over the top like this and
 

239
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:53,549
when I go over the top like this and
then I lower I drop that shoulder blade

and lowering Lorre and now it's at the
 

249
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,529
and lowering Lorre and now it's at the
bottom two cuts not done do you see that

bottom two cuts not done do you see that
 

251
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,439
bottom two cuts not done do you see that
all right so once that's locked in place

252
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:08,449
all right so once that's locked in place
 

253
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,409
all right so once that's locked in place
then everything else walks in place

there's an opposite shoulder blade went
 

267
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,189
there's an opposite shoulder blade went
up right and then you just have your arm

268
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:30,199
up right and then you just have your arm
 

269
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,939
up right and then you just have your arm
to go

270
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:31,949
to go
 

271
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,450
