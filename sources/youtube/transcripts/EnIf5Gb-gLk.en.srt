15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,590

OT do EO though

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600

 

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,630

okay

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:43,640

 

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,990

okay all
right

24
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,640
right
 

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,550
right
uh

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
uh
 

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,389
uh
okay so the

28
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399
okay so the
 

29
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,830
okay so the
problem is that or we think the problem

30
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
problem is that or we think the problem
 

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,990
problem is that or we think the problem
problem is that there's mistakes being

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,000
problem is that there's mistakes being
 

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,429
problem is that there's mistakes being
made and UK has an opportunity to fix

34
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
made and UK has an opportunity to fix
 

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,910
made and UK has an opportunity to fix
the person okay and the second mistake

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
the person okay and the second mistake
 

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,229
the person okay and the second mistake
is that the best way of fixing the nag

38
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:17,239
is that the best way of fixing the nag
 

39
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,150
is that the best way of fixing the nag
is to resist the nagas technique okay to

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,160
is to resist the nagas technique okay to
 

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,390
is to resist the nagas technique okay to
expose its openings so to speak okay but

42
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
expose its openings so to speak okay but
 

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,030

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,309

okay but pedagogically the logic is

50
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
okay but pedagogically the logic is
 

51
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,670
okay but pedagogically the logic is
unsound so UK cannot learn

52
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:42,680

all those other ways you did so my

944
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
all those other ways you did so my
 

945
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,630
all those other ways you did so my
expectation at this point is if we were

expectation at this point is if we were
 

947

00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,190
you see that so you have to keep working
and you'll get rid of a lot of stuff

developing them as
 

1431
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,710
developing them as
Naga and then you stop developing those

1432
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
Naga and then you stop developing those
 

1433
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,630

00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,000
see if we get this
 

1521
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,510
see if we get this
going so again I think you should be in

1522
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
going so again I think you should be in
 

1523
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,390
going so again I think you should be in
a teacher

1524
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:07,400
a teacher
 

1525
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,549
a teacher
role so as we watched his uh technique

1526
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:11,559
role so as we watched his uh technique
 

1527
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,349
role so as we watched his uh technique
you can see he does not know the

1528
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:16,359
you can see he does not know the
 

1529
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,270
you can see he does not know the
architectural uh design for Iko M did

1530
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:20,280
architectural uh design for Iko M did
 

1531
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,390
architectural uh design for Iko M did
you guys all see that okay he has a

1532
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:23,400
you guys all see that okay he has a

1539
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,829
the middle of that which was crazy right
okay so what I can do

1540
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:35,839
okay so what I can do
 

1541
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,710
okay so what I can do
now is from the grounded this I can make

1542
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:40,720
now is from the grounded this I can make
 

1543
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,630
now is from the grounded this I can make
it where he has to follow the path of

1544
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:43,640
it where he has to follow the path of
 

1545
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,950
it where he has to follow the path of
lease resistance and I will guide him

1546
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
lease resistance and I will guide him
 

1547
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,390
lease resistance and I will guide him
that way into the proper technique and I

1548
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
that way into the proper technique and I
 

1549
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,950
that way into the proper technique and I
can combine that with verbal cues

not just demonstrating it but I'm
 

1795
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,589
not just demonstrating it but I'm
actually training it and you'll see me

1796
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:40,599
actually training it and you'll see me
