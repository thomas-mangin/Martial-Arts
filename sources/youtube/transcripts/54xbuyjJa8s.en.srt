as you go

172
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:05,580
as you go
 

173
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,170
as you go
you keep this same liberal state

174
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,180
you keep this same liberal state
 

175
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,929
you keep this same liberal state
there should not be any movement

176
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:11,939
there should not be any movement
 

177
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,809
there should not be any movement
in your body

178
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
in your body
 

179
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,289
in your body
in in fact tactically you're hiding the

180
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
in in fact tactically you're hiding the
 

181
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,789
in in fact tactically you're hiding the
fact that you're drawing you're not

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:19,799
fact that you're drawing you're not

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,689
fact that you're drawing you're not
trying to out draw him you're trying to

184
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:22,699
trying to out draw him you're trying to
 

185
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,050
trying to out draw him you're trying to
see how deep into the move you can get

186
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,060
see how deep into the move you can get
 

187
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,270
see how deep into the move you can get
before he senses you are actually

188
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
before he senses you are actually
 

189
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,909
before he senses you are actually
attacking okay do you understand that

190
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
attacking okay do you understand that
 

191
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,490
attacking okay do you understand that
difference okay so I do this with the

192
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,500
difference okay so I do this with the
 

193
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,310
difference okay so I do this with the
new deputies uh when we draw against

194
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,320
new deputies uh when we draw against
 

195
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,530
new deputies uh when we draw against
each other in certain training drills we

196
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:39,540
each other in certain training drills we
 

197
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,370

do
 

199
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,210
do
and uh one person will draw first and

200
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,220
and uh one person will draw first and
 

201
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,330
and uh one person will draw first and
then you try to beat them right

202
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,340
then you try to beat them right
 

203
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,390
then you try to beat them right
you can always beat them

204

you can always beat them
 

205
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,050
you can always beat them
by a great great deal if you don't freak

206
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,060
by a great great deal if you don't freak

by a great great deal if you don't freak
out and try to go your fastest on the

they can't sense it happening until
you're way too deep into the draw so you

00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:04,979
you're way too deep into the draw so you
 

215
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,870
you're way too deep into the draw so you
always win it by a mile okay you can

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,870

okay let's try it go

290
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:11,880

 

291
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:20,150

okay let's just get to here

293
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,150

so this this movement happens without

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,160
so this this movement happens without
 

295
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,290
so this this movement happens without
any meaning elsewhere

296

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,100
early I can bottle thrust forward I
 

347
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,610
early I can bottle thrust forward I
can't do this like that

348
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:49,620
can't do this like that
 

349
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,790
can't do this like that
and very exposed I'm very mechanically

350
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
and very exposed I'm very mechanically
 

351
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,930
and very exposed I'm very mechanically
unsound

352
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:53,940
unsound
 

353
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,210
unsound
and I'm also exposed over here on the

354
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,220
and I'm also exposed over here on the
 

355
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,810
and I'm also exposed over here on the
ribs okay and I'm telegraphing

356
00:08:59,810 --> 00:08:59,820
ribs okay and I'm telegraphing
 

357
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,710
ribs okay and I'm telegraphing
so this hand goes

358
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
so this hand goes
 

359
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,170
so this hand goes
this way

360
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,180
this way
 

361
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,850
this way
comes out

362
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:07,860
comes out
 

363
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,250
comes out
and into the person

364
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
and into the person
 

365
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,230
and into the person
uh Ronin

366
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240

 

367
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,009

okay so we'll just do a drill

368
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:19,019
okay so we'll just do a drill
 

369
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,670
okay so we'll just do a drill
so you can appreciate it a little more

370
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
so you can appreciate it a little more
 

371
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,250
so you can appreciate it a little more
what you're doing okay I don't want you

372
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,260
what you're doing okay I don't want you
 

373
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,590
what you're doing okay I don't want you
to kill him this is not the Maya of the

374
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
to kill him this is not the Maya of the
 

375
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,290
to kill him this is not the Maya of the
form but I still I just want the drill

376
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,300
form but I still I just want the drill
 

377
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,070
form but I still I just want the drill
okay so I don't move anything I just

378
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
okay so I don't move anything I just
 

379
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,410
okay so I don't move anything I just
come out boom boom and push him over

380
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
come out boom boom and push him over
 

381
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:49,730
come out boom boom and push him over
that's all I'm doing

382
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:49,740

 

383
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,710

okay let's try it

384
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720

 

385
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,530

so again you have a mental perception

386
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
so again you have a mental perception
 

387
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,750
so again you have a mental perception
it's it's delusional you're not

388
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
it's it's delusional you're not
 

389
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,670
it's it's delusional you're not
understanding knife fighting nor the

390
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
understanding knife fighting nor the
 

391
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,130
understanding knife fighting nor the
energetic component okay

392
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,140
energetic component okay
 

393
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,530
energetic component okay
again I don't want to stick things out

394
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:09,540

 

395
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,610

so you know for example that your sword

396
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:13,620
so you know for example that your sword
 

397
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,449
so you know for example that your sword
ends up from over here and then ends up

398
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:17,459
ends up from over here and then ends up
 

399
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,070
ends up from over here and then ends up
over here

400
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,080
over here
 

401
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,769
over here
and what you did is you pictured is like

402
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:21,779
and what you did is you pictured is like
 

403
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,230
and what you did is you pictured is like
a lightsaber cut

404
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
a lightsaber cut
 

405
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,690
a lightsaber cut
do that so you're moving your whole arm

406
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,700
do that so you're moving your whole arm
 

407
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,210
do that so you're moving your whole arm
from right to left that's all you can

408
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,220
from right to left that's all you can
 

409
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,490
from right to left that's all you can
figure out is how that gets there

410
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:31,500
figure out is how that gets there
 

411
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,350
figure out is how that gets there
but the principle of not telegraphing is

412
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,360
but the principle of not telegraphing is
 

413
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,690
but the principle of not telegraphing is
the more Dimensions you travel through

414
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:38,700
the more Dimensions you travel through
 

415
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,730
the more Dimensions you travel through
height width and depth the more

416
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:40,740
height width and depth the more
 

417
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,470
height width and depth the more
telegraphing you're doing

418
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
telegraphing you're doing
 

419
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,269
telegraphing you're doing
so at the beginning I'm trying to stay

420
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:46,279
so at the beginning I'm trying to stay
 

421
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,550
so at the beginning I'm trying to stay
in the sagittal plane only the depth

422
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
in the sagittal plane only the depth
 

423
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,670
in the sagittal plane only the depth
okay I don't want to give him any width

424
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
okay I don't want to give him any width
 

425
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,910
okay I don't want to give him any width
if I give him wit

426
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
if I give him wit
 

427
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,250
if I give him wit
he's gonna see it with the depth he's

428
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,260
he's gonna see it with the depth he's
 

429
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,190
he's gonna see it with the depth he's
gonna see it okay so

430
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
gonna see it okay so
 

431
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,130
gonna see it okay so
as I as I position The Sword in the

432
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,140
as I as I position The Sword in the
 

433
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,870
as I as I position The Sword in the
beginning

434
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:05,880
beginning
 

435
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,250
beginning
okay

436
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:07,260
okay
 

437
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,150
okay
I have this balance between I don't want

438
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,160
I have this balance between I don't want
 

439
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,150
I have this balance between I don't want
to move my hands a great deal

440
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
to move my hands a great deal
 

441
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,990
to move my hands a great deal
but I don't want this thing telegraphing

442
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,000
but I don't want this thing telegraphing
 

443
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,769
but I don't want this thing telegraphing
depth or width sorry okay so if I put it

444
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:21,779
depth or width sorry okay so if I put it
 

445
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,930
depth or width sorry okay so if I put it
over here

446
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:23,940
over here
 

447
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,810
over here
there I can stay in the same sagittal

448
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:26,820
there I can stay in the same sagittal
 

449
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,069
there I can stay in the same sagittal
plane on this point here to his body but

450
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,079
plane on this point here to his body but
 

451
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,650
plane on this point here to his body but
what do I have to do give with to get

452
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
what do I have to do give with to get
 

453
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,750
what do I have to do give with to get
over there do you see that so you have

454
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
over there do you see that so you have
 

455
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,550
over there do you see that so you have
to find this balance

456
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
to find this balance
 

457
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,670
to find this balance
as a general rule a general rule because

458
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,680
as a general rule a general rule because
 

459
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,650
as a general rule a general rule because
it depends on the length of your tsuka

460
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:42,660
it depends on the length of your tsuka
 

461
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,350
it depends on the length of your tsuka
so you can see matsuka is long

462
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
so you can see matsuka is long
 

463
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,170
so you can see matsuka is long
and the width of your tsuba is also is

464
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
and the width of your tsuba is also is
 

465
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,329
and the width of your tsuba is also is
different

466
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:50,339
different
 

467
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,710
different
the inner edge of your Suva is somewhere

468
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
the inner edge of your Suva is somewhere
 

469
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,370
the inner edge of your Suva is somewhere
in the area of halfway from your outer

470
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,380
in the area of halfway from your outer
 

471
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,970
in the area of halfway from your outer
rim and your spine your navel it's

472
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
rim and your spine your navel it's
 

473
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,269
rim and your spine your navel it's
somewhere in that area okay

474
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
somewhere in that area okay
 

475
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,790
somewhere in that area okay
to refine the area

476
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
to refine the area
 

477
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,610
to refine the area
I would enter the liminal State see

478
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
I would enter the liminal State see
 

479
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,889
I would enter the liminal State see
where my hands end up going as my body

480
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:12,899
where my hands end up going as my body
 

481
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,730
where my hands end up going as my body
positions itself and then move this

482
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:16,740
positions itself and then move this
 

483
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,050
positions itself and then move this
thing

484
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,060
thing
 

485
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,370
thing
over or outward as you need to in order

486
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,380
over or outward as you need to in order
 

487
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,889
over or outward as you need to in order
to not Telegraph or flare your elbow for

488
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:24,899
to not Telegraph or flare your elbow for
 

489
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,130
to not Telegraph or flare your elbow for
knife fighting tactics so this is too

490
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,140
knife fighting tactics so this is too
 

491
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,210
knife fighting tactics so this is too
far so I'll move it again

492
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,220

 

493
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,490

now my hands can touch it

494
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:34,500
now my hands can touch it
 

495
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,449
now my hands can touch it
okay without moving left or right my

496
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:38,459
okay without moving left or right my
 

497
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,670
okay without moving left or right my
hands can just come up and touch it okay

498
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:40,680
hands can just come up and touch it okay
 

499
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,009
hands can just come up and touch it okay
so

500
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:43,019
so
 

501
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,210
so
as I move and I come up

502
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,220
as I move and I come up
 

503
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,730
as I move and I come up
all I'm trying to do is have this sword

504
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:49,740
all I'm trying to do is have this sword
 

505
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,090
all I'm trying to do is have this sword
go as straight out as possible straight

506
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,100
go as straight out as possible straight
 

507
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,370
go as straight out as possible straight
out boom

508
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,380
out boom
 

509
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,009
out boom
so let's look at some of the things if

510
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:58,019
so let's look at some of the things if
 

511
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,150
so let's look at some of the things if
you come around to the front you'll see

512
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160

 

513
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,750

to space so from here I can't hit that

516
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:09,420
to space so from here I can't hit that
 

517

519
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,949

but as I move as I go up you're going to

520
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
but as I move as I go up you're going to
 

521
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,530
but as I move as I go up you're going to
see as I go up look what happened

522
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:18,540
see as I go up look what happened
 

523
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,410
see as I go up look what happened
it works okay

524
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,420
it works okay
 

525
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,889
it works okay
where did where did that space come from

526
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:24,899
where did where did that space come from
 

527
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,110
where did where did that space come from
my knees will go slightly in

528
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120

 

529
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,530

so as I go you're gonna watch my knees

530
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:33,540
so as I go you're gonna watch my knees
 

531
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,690
so as I go you're gonna watch my knees
will go and see how they went in

532
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:35,700
will go and see how they went in
 

533
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,810
will go and see how they went in

you straight fall back

546
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:56,279
you straight fall back
 

547
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,910
you straight fall back
and now I can get that thing to hit the

548
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:58,920
and now I can get that thing to hit the
 

549
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,230
and now I can get that thing to hit the
center line

550
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
center line
 

551
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,250
center line
I don't have things sticking out okay

552
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,260
I don't have things sticking out okay
 

553
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,230
I don't have things sticking out okay
as I hit him

554
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
as I hit him
 

555
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,670
as I hit him
don't let

with this sword so you don't want to go
like this

564
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720

 

565
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,590

don't want to do that

all I'm doing here is boom you're

568
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,180
all I'm doing here is boom you're
 

569
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,210
all I'm doing here is boom you're
getting

570
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,220
getting
 

571
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,389
getting
drill okay so let's try it again and

572
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,399
drill okay so let's try it again and
 

573
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,329
drill okay so let's try it again and
then we'll get to well how does my sword

574
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,339
then we'll get to well how does my sword
 

575
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,610
then we'll get to well how does my sword
get over there okay all right let's try

576
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:34,620
get over there okay all right let's try
 

577
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,190
get over there okay all right let's try
hey

578
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,200

 

579
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,050

chaining on your own

580
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,060
chaining on your own
 

581
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:59,990
chaining on your own
bring that into the nukes get

582
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000

 

583
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,470

so the energetic values are going to be

584
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
so the energetic values are going to be
 

585
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,610
so the energetic values are going to be
your Marshall values so so far

586
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:07,620
your Marshall values so so far
 

587
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,150
your Marshall values so so far
by doing things energetically correct I

588
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
by doing things energetically correct I
 

589
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,590
by doing things energetically correct I
don't Telegraph

604
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,160
contingency plan on deck which you
 

605
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,310
contingency plan on deck which you
always have to marshally because

606
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,320
always have to marshally because
 

607
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,310
always have to marshally because
 doesn't work okay

608
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
doesn't work okay
 

609
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,829
doesn't work okay
when I have the improper energetic

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:36,839
when I have the improper energetic
 

611
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,650
when I have the improper energetic
values elbows are flared so that's

612
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
values elbows are flared so that's
 

613
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,590
values elbows are flared so that's
targets are sticking out right I didn't

614
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
targets are sticking out right I didn't
 

615
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,949
targets are sticking out right I didn't
dominate the center line as I as early

616
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
dominate the center line as I as early
 

617
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,350
dominate the center line as I as early
as I could because I'm swinging my arm

618
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,360
as I could because I'm swinging my arm
 

619
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,810
as I could because I'm swinging my arm
out to the right that doesn't make sense

620
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:50,820
out to the right that doesn't make sense
 

621
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,689
out to the right that doesn't make sense
marshally and I'm telegraphing the high

622
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:53,699
marshally and I'm telegraphing the high
 

623
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,610
marshally and I'm telegraphing the high
Health which means it's only going to

624
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:55,620
Health which means it's only going to
 

625
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,189
Health which means it's only going to
work if I'm physically faster than that

626
00:15:58,189 --> 00:15:58,199
work if I'm physically faster than that
 

627
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,189
work if I'm physically faster than that
person that doesn't make Marshall sense

628
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
person that doesn't make Marshall sense
 

629
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,170
person that doesn't make Marshall sense
okay

630
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,180
okay
 

631
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,730
okay
so same thing here if I do the form

632
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:06,740
so same thing here if I do the form
 

633
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,170
so same thing here if I do the form
energetically correctly I will marshally

634
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,180
energetically correctly I will marshally
 

635
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,750
energetically correctly I will marshally
do the form correctly there were a lot

636
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:14,760
do the form correctly there were a lot
 

637
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,769
do the form correctly there were a lot
of you

638
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:15,779
of you
 

639
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,329
of you
that sought your stance and then drew

640
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:20,339
that sought your stance and then drew
 

641
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,710
that sought your stance and then drew
the weapon

642
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:21,720
the weapon
 

643
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,490
the weapon
that makes no sense because you just

644
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:25,500
that makes no sense because you just
 

645
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,610
that makes no sense because you just
stuck your target out there

646
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:28,620
stuck your target out there
 

647
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,490
stuck your target out there
before you got your weapon out there

648
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,500
before you got your weapon out there
 

649
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,530
before you got your weapon out there
do you understand that doesn't make

650
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:33,540
do you understand that doesn't make
 

651
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,410
do you understand that doesn't make
sense that's like you you send your

652
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,420
sense that's like you you send your
 

653
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,870
sense that's like you you send your
troops onto the beach

654
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
troops onto the beach
 

655
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,090
troops onto the beach
and then you bomb the beach

656
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,100
and then you bomb the beach
 

657
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,689
and then you bomb the beach
no bomb the beach first and then send

658
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:44,699
no bomb the beach first and then send
 

659
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,449
no bomb the beach first and then send
your troops onto the beach okay so first

660
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:47,459
your troops onto the beach okay so first
 

661
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,610
your troops onto the beach okay so first
I'll demonstrate the mistake as you're

662
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,620
I'll demonstrate the mistake as you're
 

663
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,490
I'll demonstrate the mistake as you're
going along you're coming out and you go

664
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:52,500
going along you're coming out and you go
 

665
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,590
going along you're coming out and you go
like this and then you went like that

666
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
like this and then you went like that
 

667
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,610
like this and then you went like that
that the sword goes first The Stance

668
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:58,620
that the sword goes first The Stance
 

669
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,550
that the sword goes first The Stance
follows the sword okay that's all we're

670
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,560
follows the sword okay that's all we're
 

671
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,470
follows the sword okay that's all we're
looking at right now we still haven't

672
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
looking at right now we still haven't
 

673
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,270
looking at right now we still haven't
yet dealt with how does my sword go from

674
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
yet dealt with how does my sword go from
 

675
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,809
yet dealt with how does my sword go from
here to there okay so this sword goes

676
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:08,819
here to there okay so this sword goes
 

677
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,270
here to there okay so this sword goes
first that is one reason why you'll see

678
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
first that is one reason why you'll see
 

679
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,970
first that is one reason why you'll see
that my knees have to come in the sword

680
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:13,980
that my knees have to come in the sword
 

681
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,429

goes first The Stance follows the sword

682
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
goes first The Stance follows the sword
 

683
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,870
goes first The Stance follows the sword
okay

684
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
okay
 

685
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,829
okay
look at this energetically

686
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839

 

687
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,150

the sword is Young energy it generates

688
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
the sword is Young energy it generates
 

689
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,169
the sword is Young energy it generates
space then I could do Ed me you don't do

690
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:30,179
space then I could do Ed me you don't do
 

691
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,450
space then I could do Ed me you don't do
eating me where there's no tsuki where

692
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:32,460
eating me where there's no tsuki where
 

693
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,490
eating me where there's no tsuki where
there's no opening for eating meat okay

694
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:34,500
there's no opening for eating meat okay
 

695
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,330
there's no opening for eating meat okay
so the sword creates the space boom and

696
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,340
so the sword creates the space boom and
 

697
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,210
so the sword creates the space boom and
then the sword follows that makes sense

698
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:41,220
then the sword follows that makes sense
 

699
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,510
then the sword follows that makes sense

thing increase
his little impact point do you got it

1134
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
his little impact point do you got it
 

1135
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,010
his little impact point do you got it
and then I'm in that final spot

1136
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,020
and then I'm in that final spot
 

1137
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,230
and then I'm in that final spot
stay there where you were a little lower

1138
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,240
stay there where you were a little lower
 

1139
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,049

I'll move up
and then I have the killing blood

1144
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
and then I have the killing blood
 

1145
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,610
and then I have the killing blood
so let's look at

1146
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:43,620
so let's look at
 

1147
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:51,169
so let's look at
the my laser concept

1148
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,179

 

1149
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,810

in a street fight orientation okay

1150
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:55,820
in a street fight orientation okay
 

1151
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,669
in a street fight orientation okay
I'm gonna Chop on this throat if you see

1152
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:58,679
I'm gonna Chop on this throat if you see
 

1153
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,130
I'm gonna Chop on this throat if you see
what it did to him it all did did he die

1154
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,140
what it did to him it all did did he die
 

1155
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,669
what it did to him it all did did he die
from it did it knock him out no but it

1156
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:04,679
from it did it knock him out no but it
 

1157
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,070
from it did it knock him out no but it
just just struck and that's where my

1158
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,080
just just struck and that's where my
 

1159
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,169
just just struck and that's where my
next shot comes in that's the same

1160
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:09,179
next shot comes in that's the same
 

1161
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,390
next shot comes in that's the same
concept you're doing in this technique

1162
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:11,400
concept you're doing in this technique
 

1163
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,789
concept you're doing in this technique
okay so it's gonna occupy him because it

1164
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
okay so it's gonna occupy him because it
 

1165
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,070
okay so it's gonna occupy him because it
hits

1166
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
hits
 

1167
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,350
hits
a hinge which is going to affect his

1168
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
a hinge which is going to affect his
 

1169
