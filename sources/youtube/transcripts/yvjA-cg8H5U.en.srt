1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,540
To begin,

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,740
the Hombu Shihan,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,220
Tada Hiroshi Sensei,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,940
will give a speech.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,300
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,140
First of all, Happy New Year everyone.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,860
As it is the beginning of the year,

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,800
I’m sure all of you are motivated to practicing this coming year.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,800
Regarding that, I would like to tell you a few things.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,920
I have something here.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,140
The is the first issue of the Aikikai Newspaper, that was published on April 1st, 1950.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,420
I actually joined a month before this was issued, when I was a 20 years old student.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,360
Everyone was talking about this paper that had everything you needed to know about Aikido.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,760
It used to be called Ueshiba dojo back then.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,760
It's still the Ueshiba Dojo now actually...

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,160
It taught Ueshiba Sensei’s style.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,780
Before the war, the dojo was closed to the public,

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,140
and people couldn’t join without an introduction.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,120
There is a story of someone from the Italian embassy

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,980
who insisted on joining the dojo and sat in front of the door for a week.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,080
So Ueshiba Sensei not only taught the techniques but also the “Way”,

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,820
and why we were doing this.

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,200
Back then, every second Sunday,

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,500
we conducted something called Aiki no Kai.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,040
We had a lot of important people back then

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,000
like politicians come to the convention.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,360
And after that, Morihei Sensei would perform a demonstration and a lecture,

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,240
and the transcript was featured in the the following month’s issue of our newsletter,

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,080
even though it was just a few pieces of paper folded together.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,660
And from there, it became Aikido’s Journal.

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:22,200
Almost 9 years later in April, 1959, the first issue of Aiki Journal was published.

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:35,340
Sorry for the state it's in, but what I am holding here is the first issue of this Aiki Journal.

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,040
You can read O sensei’s lessons in there.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,340
Nowadays, we have DVD versions of all issues of Aiki Journal downstairs in the office,

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,700
which I hope you will read and learn a lot from.

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,520
Later, something like this was published for 9 years,

37
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,180
those stories became a single book called Aiki Shinzui

38
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,380
And this, it’s hard if you try to think as you read.

39
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,260
You have to feel as you read.

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:17,300
Just like you learned to do things by doing as a child, you won’t know until you do it.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,420
What is the “Way” [michi]? There are two Ways in one michi,

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:32,380
one is Shingaku, and another is Shinpo.

43
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,960
Shingaku is based on Koshi and Moshi’s studies in Edo era,

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,280
and bushido came from there.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,960
Shinpo no michi is based on the universe.

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,320
Humans are living.

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,140
Planet is living.

48
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,920
And the universe is living too.

49
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,960
And how do we live and what can we do to increase the energy of the universe?

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,720
How do we develop our skills?

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,220
That is michi.

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,080
And there is only one thing you need to remember.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,080
Don’t do things like you are obsessed.

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,440
And in modern days, we have the Olympic Games in a few years,

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,480
those people do such things as mental training and mental management,

56
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,720
and image training within those.

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,960
And all those things have traditionally been the components of Shinpo no michi.

58
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,320
That’s the michi that we have had in the East since 3000 years ago.

59
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,280
So the Aikido that we are doing is the michi that best reflects the tradition.

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,920
The latest thing people in the US and Europe are doing,

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
similar to michi,

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,160
we have been practicing for as long as we can trace back,

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,960
and I hope you understand that and work hard, not only on the skills.

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Then you will get to learn how to increase your energy,

65
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
overcome sickness and allergies.

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Let's do this this year!
