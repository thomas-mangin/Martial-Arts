part part of it is that you you don't
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,749
part part of it is that you you don't
want to fight without a weapon the only

00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
want to fight without a weapon the only
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,070
want to fight without a weapon the only
reason you're ever fighting empty hand

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
reason you're ever fighting empty hand
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,350
reason you're ever fighting empty hand
is cu I couldn't get to my weapon okay

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
is cu I couldn't get to my weapon okay
 

9
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,430
is cu I couldn't get to my weapon okay
so when we told him to do whatever he he

10
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,440
so when we told him to do whatever he he
 

11
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,910
so when we told him to do whatever he he
grabed okay and you can see it's not a

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
grabed okay and you can see it's not a
 

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,550
grabed okay and you can see it's not a
normal iido grab it doesn't matter okay

14
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,560
normal iido grab it doesn't matter okay
 

15
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,990
normal iido grab it doesn't matter okay
so I always have to deviate now I can't

16
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
so I always have to deviate now I can't
 

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,230
so I always have to deviate now I can't
grab my weapon right now what you've

18
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
grab my weapon right now what you've
 

19
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,470
grab my weapon right now what you've
been studying up till now is Project off

20
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
been studying up till now is Project off
 

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,030
been studying up till now is Project off
now I grab my weapon and the reason for

22
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,040
now I grab my weapon and the reason for
 

23
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,910
now I grab my weapon and the reason for
that is you don't want to grab same

24
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
that is you don't want to grab same
 

25
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,270
that is you don't want to grab same
thing you don't want to grab before

26
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
thing you don't want to grab before
 

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,389
thing you don't want to grab before
initiative has been determined so right

28
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:43,399
initiative has been determined so right
 

29
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,430
initiative has been determined so right
now he actually has initiative which is

30
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
now he actually has initiative which is
 

31
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,670
now he actually has initiative which is
even worse but you don't want to grab

32
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,680
even worse but you don't want to grab
 

33
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,189
even worse but you don't want to grab
where you're going to cause deployment

34
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:50,199
where you're going to cause deployment
 

35
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,110
where you're going to cause deployment
issues and you start fighting over the

36
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,120
issues and you start fighting over the
 

37
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,069
issues and you start fighting over the
weapon you see no I don't want to do

38
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
weapon you see no I don't want to do
 

39
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,189
weapon you see no I don't want to do
that camera come

40
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
that camera come
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,790
that camera come
around I'm going to lose this weapon

42
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800

 

43
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,550

okay aside from creating

44
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:05,560
okay aside from creating
 

45
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,190
okay aside from creating
distance I can learn to trap okay so

46
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,200
distance I can learn to trap okay so
 

47
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,789
distance I can learn to trap okay so
here what I'm going to do is learn how

48
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:11,799
here what I'm going to do is learn how
 

49
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,149
here what I'm going to do is learn how
to draw my weapon from close range by

50
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
to draw my weapon from close range by
 

51
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,830
to draw my weapon from close range by
creating a zone of

52
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
creating a zone of
 

53
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,950
creating a zone of
sanctuary so come get every angle

54
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:23,960

 

55
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,990

camera okay I'm going to take this wrist

56
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
camera okay I'm going to take this wrist
 

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,550
camera okay I'm going to take this wrist
grab and then push

58
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
grab and then push
 

59
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,550
grab and then push
his left arm into his body as I take the

60
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
his left arm into his body as I take the
 

61
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,190
his left arm into his body as I take the
back now I have this arm his right arm

62
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
back now I have this arm his right arm
 

63
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,429
back now I have this arm his right arm
occupied his left arm occupied and now I

64
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:44,439
occupied his left arm occupied and now I
 

65
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,550
occupied his left arm occupied and now I
create a Zone Sanctuary that I can

66
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:47,560
create a Zone Sanctuary that I can
 

67
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,590
create a Zone Sanctuary that I can
freely draw the weapon without a

71
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,109
retention
issue I'm

72
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
issue I'm
 

73

00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
hold him here he can just force his way
 

77
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,109
hold him here he can just force his way
out you see and I'm in the same

78
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
out you see and I'm in the same
 

79
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,870
out you see and I'm in the same
problem what I have to do instead is is

80
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
problem what I have to do instead is is
 

81
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,550
problem what I have to do instead is is
keep myself in the

follow of stick and follow okay so when
 

85
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,150
follow of stick and follow okay so when
he moves I just move with him I don't

86
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
he moves I just move with him I don't
 

87

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,120
Tilt I have to uh project against that
 

107
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,390
Tilt I have to uh project against that
Center you see doing all

108
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
Center you see doing all
 

109
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,949
Center you see doing all
that but now I add the rotation

110
00:02:59,949 --> 00:02:59,959

 

111
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,910

here we can demonstrate
 

143
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,990
here we can demonstrate
that I'm still ground vectoring so be

144
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
that I'm still ground vectoring so be
 

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,509
that I'm still ground vectoring so be
ready okay and I'm doing the

146
