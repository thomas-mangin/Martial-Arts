00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559

 

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,390

It's kind of like the boat rowing. Do

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
It's kind of like the boat rowing. Do
 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,230
It's kind of like the boat rowing. Do
you see?

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
you see?
 

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,910
you see?
>> It's kind of like it. So, he's driving,

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
>> It's kind of like it. So, he's driving,
 

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,670
>> It's kind of like it. So, he's driving,
right? And I had to have that turn. Do

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
right? And I had to have that turn. Do
 

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,509
right? And I had to have that turn. Do
you see?

12
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
you see?
 

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,310
you see?
>> And that part is where Whoa. Oh, cuz

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
>> And that part is where Whoa. Oh, cuz
 

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,110
>> And that part is where Whoa. Oh, cuz
that is not where my bracing angle is.

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
that is not where my bracing angle is.
 

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,630
that is not where my bracing angle is.
Do you see that? But if I am shifting

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
Do you see that? But if I am shifting
 

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,310
Do you see that? But if I am shifting
weight properly, that doesn't matter.

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
weight properly, that doesn't matter.
 

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,709
weight properly, that doesn't matter.
>> Do you see? This doesn't matter. And

22
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
>> Do you see? This doesn't matter. And
 

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,350
>> Do you see? This doesn't matter. And
then this part is easy. Okay. Once you

24
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
then this part is easy. Okay. Once you
 

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,029
then this part is easy. Okay. Once you
get there,

26
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
get there,
 

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,190
get there,
but getting there is the hard part.

28
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
but getting there is the hard part.
 

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,549
but getting there is the hard part.
Okay. Um,

30
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
Okay. Um,
 

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,310
Okay. Um,
can you see that? Let's do it from this

32
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
can you see that? Let's do it from this
 

33
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,150
can you see that? Let's do it from this
angle.

34
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
angle.
 

35
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,150
angle.
Okay.

36
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
Okay.
 

37
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,069
Okay.
So

38
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
So
 

39
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,830
So
here you can kind of get that bracing

40
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
here you can kind of get that bracing
 

41
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,830
here you can kind of get that bracing
angle. Do you see? Okay. But once you

42
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
angle. Do you see? Okay. But once you
 

43
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,429
angle. Do you see? Okay. But once you
come here, there's no there's no bracing

44
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
come here, there's no there's no bracing
 

45
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,990
come here, there's no there's no bracing
angle anymore. There's only ground

46
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
angle anymore. There's only ground
 

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,270
angle anymore. There's only ground
vectoring and then this turns.

48
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
vectoring and then this turns.
 

49
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,429
vectoring and then this turns.
Okay. So then it's just

50
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
Okay. So then it's just
 

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,350
Okay. So then it's just
boom.

52
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
boom.
 

53
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,550
boom.
Okay.

54
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
Okay.
 

55
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,910
Okay.
>> Okay. So pay attention to that. And I

56
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
>> Okay. So pay attention to that. And I
 

57
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,109
>> Okay. So pay attention to that. And I
would do the same thing

58
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
would do the same thing
 

59
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,590
would do the same thing
rel as you release the muscle tension at

60
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
rel as you release the muscle tension at
 

61
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,390
rel as you release the muscle tension at
the earliest sensation of it you're

62
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
the earliest sensation of it you're
 

63
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,710
the earliest sensation of it you're
going to be more successful then you try

64
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
going to be more successful then you try
 

65
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,149
going to be more successful then you try
to release it where now it's

66
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
to release it where now it's
 

67
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,190
to release it where now it's
structurally dependent. Do you get it?

68
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
structurally dependent. Do you get it?
 

69
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,630
structurally dependent. Do you get it?
The same it's the same exact thing

70
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
The same it's the same exact thing
 

71
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,069
The same it's the same exact thing
as you start to feel that rather than

72
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
as you start to feel that rather than
 

73
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,069
as you start to feel that rather than
flexing and try to hold it longer

74
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
flexing and try to hold it longer
 

75
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,830
flexing and try to hold it longer
because there's no you can't hold it

76
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
because there's no you can't hold it
 

77
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,469
because there's no you can't hold it
here. Do you see this energy is going

78
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
here. Do you see this energy is going
 

79
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,270
here. Do you see this energy is going
here and this bracing angle is off to

80
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
here and this bracing angle is off to
 

81
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,109
here and this bracing angle is off to
the side. Okay. So, as you starting to

82
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
the side. Okay. So, as you starting to
 

83
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,630
the side. Okay. So, as you starting to
feel it, oh, I can feel Oh, that release

84
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
feel it, oh, I can feel Oh, that release
 

85
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,789
feel it, oh, I can feel Oh, that release
that calf tension. Release it. Let all

86
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
that calf tension. Release it. Let all
 

87
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,790
that calf tension. Release it. Let all
that drop. Okay.

88
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
that drop. Okay.
 

89
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
that drop. Okay.
>> All right. Shy.
