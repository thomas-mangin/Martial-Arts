but it has a really important function
 

551
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,669
but it has a really important function
so just like the calisthenics for our

552
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
so just like the calisthenics for our
 

553
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,430
so just like the calisthenics for our
body the meditation

554
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
body the meditation
 

555
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,029
body the meditation
clears out our mind straightens and

556
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
clears out our mind straightens and
 

557
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,710
clears out our mind straightens and
strengthens our mind so

558
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
strengthens our mind so
 

559
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,110
strengthens our mind so
when you're meditating you are training

560
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
when you're meditating you are training
 

561
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,750
when you're meditating you are training
yourself

562
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
yourself
 

563
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,390
yourself
no different than lifting weights or

564
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
no different than lifting weights or
 

565
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,390
no different than lifting weights or
doing calisthenics or anything else so

566
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
doing calisthenics or anything else so
 

567
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,990
doing calisthenics or anything else so
at the end of this we're not meditating

568
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
at the end of this we're not meditating
 

569
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,909
at the end of this we're not meditating
because it's mystical and sweet we're

570
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
because it's mystical and sweet we're
 

571
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,950
because it's mystical and sweet we're
meditating because

572
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
meditating because
 

573
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,430
meditating because
it trains our mind in aikido our mind

574
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
it trains our mind in aikido our mind
 

575
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,149
it trains our mind in aikido our mind
being strong

576
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
being strong
 

577
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,950
being strong
is super important at least is important

578
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
is super important at least is important
 

579
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,590
is super important at least is important
probably more

580
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600
probably more
 

581
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,269
probably more
much more important than our body being

582
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
much more important than our body being
 

583
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,710
much more important than our body being
strong the reason for that is because

584
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
strong the reason for that is because
 

585
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,110
strong the reason for that is because
in aikido we're talking about always

586
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
in aikido we're talking about always
 

587
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,310
in aikido we're talking about always
dealing with people who are bigger and

588
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
dealing with people who are bigger and
 

589
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,830
dealing with people who are bigger and
stronger than us and aikido the other

590
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
stronger than us and aikido the other
 

591
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,310
stronger than us and aikido the other
guys always stronger than me i have no

592
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
guys always stronger than me i have no
 

593
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,470
guys always stronger than me i have no
ability to physically compete with that

594
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
ability to physically compete with that
 

595
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,990
ability to physically compete with that
person or person

person or person
 

597
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,669
person or person
so because of that my mind has to be

598
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
so because of that my mind has to be
 

599
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,269
so because of that my mind has to be
sharp and i have to be able to call upon

600
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
sharp and i have to be able to call upon
 

601
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,990
sharp and i have to be able to call upon
my mind

602
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
my mind
 

603
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,909
my mind
to act the way i need it to act when i

604
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919

605
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,669
to act the way i need it to act when i
need it to act that way right and so

606
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
need it to act that way right and so
 

607
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,750
need it to act that way right and so

623
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,149
and there's lots of different kinds of
meditation

624
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
meditation
 

625
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,310
meditation
i use observational meditation almost

626
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
i use observational meditation almost
 

627
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,750
i use observational meditation almost
exclusively for myself

628
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
exclusively for myself
 

629
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,669
exclusively for myself
i do do a few other meditations and and

630
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
i do do a few other meditations and and
 

631
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,870
i do do a few other meditations and and
before this series is done we'll

632
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
before this series is done we'll
 

633
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,830
before this series is done we'll
probably get into a few other

634
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
probably get into a few other
 

635
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,870
probably get into a few other
meditations but

636
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
meditations but
 

637
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,830
meditations but
meditation is there purposefully to

638
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
meditation is there purposefully to
 

639
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,750
meditation is there purposefully to
build the mind just like calisthenics

640
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
build the mind just like calisthenics
 

641
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,510
build the mind just like calisthenics
are there purposefully to build the body

642
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
are there purposefully to build the body
 

643
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,070
are there purposefully to build the body
so

644
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
so
 

645
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,510
so
you have to look at this as a mental

646
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
you have to look at this as a mental
 

647
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,190
you have to look at this as a mental
exercise in some ways the five-minute

648
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
exercise in some ways the five-minute
 

649
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,950
exercise in some ways the five-minute
meditation to me is harder

650
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
meditation to me is harder
 

651
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,789
meditation to me is harder
than a longer meditation because i have

652
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
than a longer meditation because i have
 

653
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,549
than a longer meditation because i have
to instantly get where i want to get

654
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
to instantly get where i want to get
 

655
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,029
to instantly get where i want to get
right

656
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
right
 

657
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,789
right
and if i don't instantly get there then

658
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
and if i don't instantly get there then
 

659
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,310
and if i don't instantly get there then
i tend to tell myself like oh you're

660
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
i tend to tell myself like oh you're
 

661
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,110
i tend to tell myself like oh you're
doing bad

662
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
doing bad
 

663
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,470
doing bad
and then that's more that i

664
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
and then that's more that i
 

665
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,230
and then that's more that i
don't want right so whereas a 30 minute

666
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
don't want right so whereas a 30 minute
 

667
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,909
don't want right so whereas a 30 minute
meditation i can just kind of like ease

668
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
meditation i can just kind of like ease
 

669
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,710
meditation i can just kind of like ease
into it and then

670
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
into it and then
 

671
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,630
into it and then
before long i'm in the space and

672
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
before long i'm in the space and
 

673
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,909
before long i'm in the space and
everything's cool but in a five minute

674
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
everything's cool but in a five minute
 

675
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,630
everything's cool but in a five minute
meditation

676
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
meditation
 

677
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,630
meditation
there's more pressure on me a lot of

678
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
there's more pressure on me a lot of
 

679
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,310
there's more pressure on me a lot of
times to get to where i need to be

680
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
times to get to where i need to be
 

681
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,590
times to get to where i need to be
and this should be if i could let go of

682
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
and this should be if i could let go of
 

683
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,870
and this should be if i could let go of
that pressure i would be better at

684
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
that pressure i would be better at
 

685
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,990
that pressure i would be better at
meditating

686
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
meditating
 

687
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,669
meditating
but that's the catch 22 of the whole

688
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
but that's the catch 22 of the whole
 

689
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,149
but that's the catch 22 of the whole
thing so uh the meditation

690
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
thing so uh the meditation
 

691
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,269
thing so uh the meditation
is is is awesome and fun and relaxing i

692
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
is is is awesome and fun and relaxing i
 

693
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,149
is is is awesome and fun and relaxing i
guess it can be

694
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
guess it can be
 

695
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,549
guess it can be
um but to me it's it's mentally taxing

696
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
um but to me it's it's mentally taxing
 

697
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,310
um but to me it's it's mentally taxing
it's the same as when i tax my body and

698
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
it's the same as when i tax my body and
 

699
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,070
it's the same as when i tax my body and
i feel about the same mentally fatigued

700
