1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,030

okay so in this trail he's in a horse

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
okay so in this trail he's in a horse
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,789
okay so in this trail he's in a horse
stay still and i want him in a horse

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
stay still and i want him in a horse
 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,150
stay still and i want him in a horse
because

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
because
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,390
because
uh it's very easy to uh push his weight

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
uh it's very easy to uh push his weight
 

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,789
uh it's very easy to uh push his weight
his line of gravity outside his base of

10
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
his line of gravity outside his base of
 

11
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,669
his line of gravity outside his base of
support

12
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
support
 

13
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,990
support
okay so in this drill what i'm looking

14
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
okay so in this drill what i'm looking
 

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,429
okay so in this drill what i'm looking
for

16
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
for
 

17
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,990
for
is that my technique is actually

18
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
is that my technique is actually
 

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,150
is that my technique is actually
attacking his center

20
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
attacking his center
 

21
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,830
attacking his center
and you'll be able to see that more

22
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
and you'll be able to see that more
 

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,150
and you'll be able to see that more
noticeably

24
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
noticeably
 

25
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,990
noticeably
okay so of course this part

26
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
okay so of course this part
 

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,870
okay so of course this part
is embryonic but i'm working on that

28
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
is embryonic but i'm working on that
 

29
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,549
is embryonic but i'm working on that
part

30
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559

 

31
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,229

meaning yes i'm kind of stopping here

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
meaning yes i'm kind of stopping here
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,470
meaning yes i'm kind of stopping here
this is not the correct timing of making

34
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
this is not the correct timing of making
 

35
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,270
this is not the correct timing of making
a touch

36
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
a touch
 

37
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,350
a touch
okay but what i don't want to see is

38
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
okay but what i don't want to see is
 

39
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,990
okay but what i don't want to see is
this

40
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000

 

41
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,670

it goes into a center

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680

 

43
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,540

okay it doesn't have to do anything

44
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,550
okay it doesn't have to do anything
 

45
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,310
okay it doesn't have to do anything
[Music]

46
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
[Music]
 

47
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,109
[Music]
okay this one's a little tough

48
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119

 

49
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,030

i can't go here and then try to turn it

50
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
i can't go here and then try to turn it
 

51
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,230
i can't go here and then try to turn it
it won't work but i'm also not just

52
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
it won't work but i'm also not just
 

53
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,630
it won't work but i'm also not just
spinning it while i'm over here

54
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
spinning it while i'm over here
 

55
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,390
spinning it while i'm over here
and there's no touch so

56
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
and there's no touch so
 

57
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:38,830
and there's no touch so
boom boom

58
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840

 

59
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,990

one

60
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000

 

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,510

okay let's okay so uh

62
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
okay let's okay so uh
 

63
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,510
okay let's okay so uh
you're in this stance so that you could

64
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
you're in this stance so that you could
 

65
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,749
you're in this stance so that you could
test that you actually have the

66
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
test that you actually have the
 

67
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,190
test that you actually have the
proper uh height

68
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
proper uh height
 

69
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,469
proper uh height
with depth check okay so if i if i'm

70
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
with depth check okay so if i if i'm
 

71
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,310
with depth check okay so if i if i'm
going here

72
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
going here
 

73
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,030
going here
and yes that's a touch on the balkan

74
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
and yes that's a touch on the balkan
 

75
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,309
and yes that's a touch on the balkan
but not on his body okay so

76
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
but not on his body okay so
 

77
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,910
but not on his body okay so
what i'm doing i'm going to go slow and

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
what i'm doing i'm going to go slow and
 

79
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,670
what i'm doing i'm going to go slow and
you'll see there's

80
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
you'll see there's
 

81
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,309
you'll see there's
energy that's going to go this way

82
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
energy that's going to go this way
 

83
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,110
energy that's going to go this way
and so he if he is tasked with the horse

84
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
and so he if he is tasked with the horse
 

85
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,150
and so he if he is tasked with the horse
stance

86
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
stance
 

87
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,630
stance
he'll lose his balance so it's not

88
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
he'll lose his balance so it's not
 

89
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,110
he'll lose his balance so it's not
enough to make him

90
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
enough to make him
 

91
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,190
enough to make him
just drop his arm do you see

92
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
just drop his arm do you see
 

93
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,150
just drop his arm do you see
you want you're looking for the line of

94
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
you want you're looking for the line of
 

95
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,350
you want you're looking for the line of
gravity

96
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
gravity
 

97
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,229
gravity
that goes into his base okay

98
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239

 

99
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,589

then we have it a little tougher

100
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
then we have it a little tougher
 

101
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,589
then we have it a little tougher
on this one okay but it's still the same

102
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
on this one okay but it's still the same
 

103
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,360
on this one okay but it's still the same
i'm not doing this okay let's go
