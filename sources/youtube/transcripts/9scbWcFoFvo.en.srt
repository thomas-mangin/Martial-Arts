um weapons
so he's quite what I call a sharp

8
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:09,780
so he's quite what I call a sharp
 

9
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,410
so he's quite what I call a sharp
teacher he'd be working like sharp in

10
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,420

positions

14
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:15,299
positions
 

15
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,450
positions
what you're doing is once you get off

16
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,460
what you're doing is once you get off
 

17
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,070
what you're doing is once you get off
here

18
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,080
here
 

19
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,509
here
watch my arm a lot of you are coming up

20
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519

 

21
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,130

that means he's got as much chance to

22
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
that means he's got as much chance to
 

23
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,490
that means he's got as much chance to
leave on you as you leaning on him and

24
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:31,500
leave on you as you leaning on him and
 

25
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,950
leave on you as you leaning on him and
pushing you away are you not answering

26
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:33,960
pushing you away are you not answering
 

27
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:47,350
pushing you away are you not answering
and so what turned his own problem was

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360

 

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,229

I go that way I go across there I don't

30
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:51,239
I go that way I go across there I don't
 

31
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,529
I go that way I go across there I don't
I don't go around this way around so

32
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:57,539

 

33
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,170

there's too much for you to remember but

34
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,180
there's too much for you to remember but
 

35
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,810
there's too much for you to remember but
and I said about cutting this way and

36
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:02,820
and I said about cutting this way and
 

37
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,609
and I said about cutting this way and
turn the hips that way I said I'm I'm

38
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
turn the hips that way I said I'm I'm
 

39
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,490
turn the hips that way I said I'm I'm
doing two things and I need to only do

40
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
doing two things and I need to only do
 

41
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,990
doing two things and I need to only do
one if I'm going to go in that direction

42
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
one if I'm going to go in that direction
 

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,969
one if I'm going to go in that direction
I'll be doing that I'll go ahead and

44
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:10,979
I'll be doing that I'll go ahead and
 

45
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,550
I'll be doing that I'll go ahead and
insert this Direction doing that so this

46
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
insert this Direction doing that so this
 

47
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,429
insert this Direction doing that so this
is the same here's cut dead straight he

48
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
is the same here's cut dead straight he
 

49
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,429
is the same here's cut dead straight he
turns for a dead straight cut again just

50
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
turns for a dead straight cut again just
 

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,429
turns for a dead straight cut again just
because he turned means the straight

52
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:22,439
because he turned means the straight
 

53
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,830
because he turned means the straight
cuts are straight so if I do my arm like

54
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
cuts are straight so if I do my arm like
 

55
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,649
cuts are straight so if I do my arm like
that like that under the circle while

56
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:27,659
that like that under the circle while
 

57
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,149
that like that under the circle while
he's doing a stride

58
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,159
he's doing a stride
 

59
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,530
he's doing a stride
so it's not the rock scissors

60
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:32,540
