1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,189

okay so when we do

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:03,199
okay so when we do
 

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,510
okay so when we do
uh shomonucci on the back uh

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
uh shomonucci on the back uh
 

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,230
uh shomonucci on the back uh
strikes here but intention is here down

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
strikes here but intention is here down
 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,950
strikes here but intention is here down
here

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
here
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,390
here
okay so we're gonna lower that

10
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
okay so we're gonna lower that
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,710
okay so we're gonna lower that
and uh we'll go in there

12
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720

 

13
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,790

there's a timing so when my weight

14
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
there's a timing so when my weight
 

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,310
there's a timing so when my weight
settles

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
settles
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,470
settles
is when i should be at full impact of

18
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
is when i should be at full impact of
 

19
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,910
is when i should be at full impact of
the strike

20
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
the strike
 

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,109
the strike
so not settling then my hand

22
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
so not settling then my hand
 

23
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,349
so not settling then my hand
there was a slight delay i just don't

24
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
there was a slight delay i just don't
 

25
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,229
there was a slight delay i just don't
want to hit here

26
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
want to hit here
 

27
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,350
want to hit here
and then my foot but there's a place

28
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
and then my foot but there's a place
 

29
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,350
and then my foot but there's a place
where my weight is heavy so when i'm

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
where my weight is heavy so when i'm
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,630
where my weight is heavy so when i'm
practicing

32
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
practicing
 

33
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,950
practicing
on the bag especially a focus mitt i'm

34
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
on the bag especially a focus mitt i'm
 

35
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,630
on the bag especially a focus mitt i'm
not trying for power i'm trying

36
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
not trying for power i'm trying
 

37
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,430
not trying for power i'm trying
for timing and geometry so i'm actually

38
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
for timing and geometry so i'm actually
 

39
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,190
for timing and geometry so i'm actually
gonna learn to take my

40
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
gonna learn to take my
 

41
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,510
gonna learn to take my
my flexion out of it and just let the

42
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
my flexion out of it and just let the
 

43
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,590
my flexion out of it and just let the
weight of my hand do everything

44
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
weight of my hand do everything
 

45
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,029
weight of my hand do everything
okay so if my foot is to the left

46
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
okay so if my foot is to the left
 

47
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,430
okay so if my foot is to the left
you're gonna find that's not the spot

48
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
you're gonna find that's not the spot
 

49
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,750
you're gonna find that's not the spot
okay it's going to be inside my front

50
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
okay it's going to be inside my front
 

51
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,430
okay it's going to be inside my front
leg

52
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
leg
 

53
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,229
leg
in alignment with my center more or less

54
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
in alignment with my center more or less
 

55
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,750
in alignment with my center more or less
okay so my hands up

56
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760

 

57
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:21,270

and just let the weight do it

58
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280

 

59
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,510

hey tristan come on

60
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520

 

61
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,350

okay so that that's what he's trying for

62
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
okay so that that's what he's trying for
 

63
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,390
okay so that that's what he's trying for
good wait

64
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
good wait
 

65
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,190
good wait
okay good

66
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200

 

67
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,389

okay all right let's go a very common

68
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
okay all right let's go a very common
 

69
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,350
okay all right let's go a very common
mistake

70
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
mistake
 

71
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,870
mistake
especially when you're trying to find

72
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
especially when you're trying to find
 

73
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,710
especially when you're trying to find
the internal aspects of the heart

74
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
the internal aspects of the heart
 

75
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,350
the internal aspects of the heart
if you have tension in in the lower legs

76
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
if you have tension in in the lower legs
 

77
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,910
if you have tension in in the lower legs
and then

78
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
and then
 

79
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,990
and then
you can't get a settling down you're

80
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
you can't get a settling down you're
 

81
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,429
you can't get a settling down you're
actually light

82
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
actually light
 

83
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,109
actually light
and energy can't go in and out of you so

84
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
and energy can't go in and out of you so
 

85
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,149
and energy can't go in and out of you so
and another um so you're very unaware of

86
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
and another um so you're very unaware of
 

87
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,789
and another um so you're very unaware of
that

88
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
that
 

89
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,190
that
and then another misconception is if i

90
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
and then another misconception is if i
 

91
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,070
and then another misconception is if i
feel myself

92
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
feel myself
 

93
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,470
feel myself
flexing then i feel powerful

94
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
flexing then i feel powerful
 

95
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,510
flexing then i feel powerful
and i feel that i am powerful

96
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
and i feel that i am powerful
 

97
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,229
and i feel that i am powerful
because i felt my flexion and this is a

98
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
because i felt my flexion and this is a
 

99
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:20,830
because i felt my flexion and this is a
very

100
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
very
 

101
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,070
very
incorrect way of assessing so you can

102
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
incorrect way of assessing so you can
 

103
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,110
incorrect way of assessing so you can
see you barely touch

104
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
see you barely touch
 

105
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,910
see you barely touch
the back so the what happens when you

106
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
the back so the what happens when you
 

107
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,910
the back so the what happens when you
add all that flexion is you actually are

108
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
add all that flexion is you actually are
 

109
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,670
add all that flexion is you actually are
slowing down the strike way

110
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
slowing down the strike way
 

111
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,750
slowing down the strike way
prior way prematurely and there's not

112
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
prior way prematurely and there's not
 

113
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,190
prior way prematurely and there's not
much penetration

114
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
much penetration
 

115
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,710
much penetration
so of my flat feel and i hit it makes me

116
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
so of my flat feel and i hit it makes me
 

117
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,750
so of my flat feel and i hit it makes me
feel strong but

118
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
feel strong but
 

119
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,630
feel strong but
it's way better if i just learn to swing

120
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
it's way better if i just learn to swing
 

121
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,670
it's way better if i just learn to swing
my fist

122
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
my fist
 

123
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,070
my fist
okay you're going to get way more energy

124
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
okay you're going to get way more energy
 

125
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,750
okay you're going to get way more energy
transference that way

126
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
transference that way
 

127
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,790
transference that way
so we'll go to yokomen

128
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
so we'll go to yokomen
 

129
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,350
so we'll go to yokomen
and it's the same thing there's going to

130
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
and it's the same thing there's going to
 

131
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,509
and it's the same thing there's going to
be a spot

132
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
be a spot
 

133
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,190
be a spot
where this is going to be heavy it's

134
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
where this is going to be heavy it's
 

135
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,949
where this is going to be heavy it's
going to be in alignment with my center

136
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
going to be in alignment with my center
 

137
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,470
going to be in alignment with my center
it's not going to be over here with my

138
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
it's not going to be over here with my
 

139
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,670
it's not going to be over here with my
foot

140
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
foot
 

141
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,670
foot
my foot should step to the right of yoko

142
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
my foot should step to the right of yoko
 

143
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,509
my foot should step to the right of yoko
and then same thing just swing the arm

144
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
and then same thing just swing the arm
 

145
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,430
and then same thing just swing the arm
like a mace i kind of feel like you want

146
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
like a mace i kind of feel like you want
 

147
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,910
like a mace i kind of feel like you want
your blood to go to your fingertips

148
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
your blood to go to your fingertips
 

149
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,309
your blood to go to your fingertips
and then make sure that the legs are

150
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
and then make sure that the legs are
 

151
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,350
and then make sure that the legs are
relaxing

152
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
relaxing
 

153
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,270
relaxing
and you just hit that spot comb

154
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280

 

155
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,470

bring extra attention to the

156
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
bring extra attention to the
 

157
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,470
bring extra attention to the
tenseness in your lower leg okay

158
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
tenseness in your lower leg okay
 

159
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,710
tenseness in your lower leg okay
okay so uh you open mind you can of

160
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
okay so uh you open mind you can of
 

161
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,030
okay so uh you open mind you can of
course throw it to the temple

162
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
course throw it to the temple
 

163
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,190
course throw it to the temple
uh you can draw here on the orbital

164
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
uh you can draw here on the orbital
 

165
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,229
uh you can draw here on the orbital
socket uh this is always good to the

166
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
socket uh this is always good to the
 

167
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,589
socket uh this is always good to the
uh carotid area of the neck and you also

168
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
uh carotid area of the neck and you also
 

169
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,550
uh carotid area of the neck and you also
have these rib cages underneath okay

170
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
have these rib cages underneath okay
 

171
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,830
have these rib cages underneath okay
um so it's

172
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
um so it's
 

173
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,630
um so it's
it's the beauty of the yoga mat strike

174
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
it's the beauty of the yoga mat strike
 

175
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,390
it's the beauty of the yoga mat strike
is you don't have to lift the elbow and

176
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
is you don't have to lift the elbow and
 

177
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,750
is you don't have to lift the elbow and
expose the rib cage

178
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
expose the rib cage
 

179
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,550
expose the rib cage
to uh to hit not not taking anything

180
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
to uh to hit not not taking anything
 

181
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,509
to uh to hit not not taking anything
away from

182
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
away from
 

183
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,589
away from
uh hooks and crosses and things like

184
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
uh hooks and crosses and things like
 

185
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,910
uh hooks and crosses and things like
that but there might be a reason why

186
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
that but there might be a reason why
 

187
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,390
that but there might be a reason why
you're not

188
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
you're not
 

189
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,589
you're not
wanting to expose yourself uh and so you

190
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
wanting to expose yourself uh and so you
 

191
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,070
wanting to expose yourself uh and so you
uh yoga men can do those things right

192
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
uh yoga men can do those things right
 

193
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,310
uh yoga men can do those things right
for example this this little short hook

194
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
for example this this little short hook
 

195
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,150
for example this this little short hook
might not do anything

196
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
might not do anything
 

197
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,909
might not do anything
but uh yokohama might be able to

198
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
but uh yokohama might be able to
 

199
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,390
but uh yokohama might be able to
generate enough displacing power

200
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
generate enough displacing power
 

201
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,629
generate enough displacing power
that you're getting in there so um

202
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
that you're getting in there so um
 

203
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,909
that you're getting in there so um
again somewhere here we'll go one just

204
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
again somewhere here we'll go one just
 

205
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,350
again somewhere here we'll go one just
target awareness one two i

206
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
target awareness one two i
 

207
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,590
target awareness one two i
can hit here this way an orbital socket

208
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
can hit here this way an orbital socket
 

209
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,430
can hit here this way an orbital socket
and then boom here in the rib cage okay

210
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
and then boom here in the rib cage okay
 

211
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,390
and then boom here in the rib cage okay
and then one thing to note is the

212
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
and then one thing to note is the
 

213
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,150
and then one thing to note is the
flexion of your arm

214
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
flexion of your arm
 

215
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,629
flexion of your arm
cannot accelerate your arm this is a

216
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
cannot accelerate your arm this is a
 

217
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,710
cannot accelerate your arm this is a
mistake the beginner makes again

218
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
mistake the beginner makes again
 

219
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,909
mistake the beginner makes again
it's related to if i feel my own flexion

220
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
it's related to if i feel my own flexion
 

221
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,310
it's related to if i feel my own flexion
i feel

222
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
i feel
 

223
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,790
i feel
powerful if i feel flexion i feel like

224
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
powerful if i feel flexion i feel like
 

225
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,990
powerful if i feel flexion i feel like
i'm moving fast

226
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
i'm moving fast
 

227
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,390
i'm moving fast
and it's not true so you can't flex this

228
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
and it's not true so you can't flex this
 

229
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,550
and it's not true so you can't flex this
arm the whole time it will never

230
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
arm the whole time it will never
 

231
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,870
arm the whole time it will never
move it can't nothing about this is

232
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
move it can't nothing about this is
 

233
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,670
move it can't nothing about this is
moving

234
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
moving
 

235
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,390
moving
so you can see that if i'm throwing my

236
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
so you can see that if i'm throwing my
 

237
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,469
so you can see that if i'm throwing my
strike and i'm starting to flex that

238
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
strike and i'm starting to flex that
 

239
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,550
strike and i'm starting to flex that
it's actually slowing me down as i'm

240
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
it's actually slowing me down as i'm
 

241
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,670
it's actually slowing me down as i'm
moving so

242
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
moving so
 

243
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,749
moving so
the the strike is moving more from the

244
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
the the strike is moving more from the
 

245
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,270
the the strike is moving more from the
hip the back

246
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
hip the back
 

247
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,150
hip the back
uh and the shoulder area right so you

248
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
uh and the shoulder area right so you
 

249
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,270
uh and the shoulder area right so you
you don't need this

250
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
you don't need this
 

251
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,629
you don't need this
and you don't want that so um

252
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
and you don't want that so um
 

253
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,950
and you don't want that so um
that way your fast food the strike is

254
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
that way your fast food the strike is
 

255
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,310
that way your fast food the strike is
very very fast

256
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
very very fast
 

257
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,070
very very fast
uh and i'm not doing this kind of stuff

258
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
uh and i'm not doing this kind of stuff
 

259
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,950
uh and i'm not doing this kind of stuff
okay

260
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
okay
 

261
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,990
okay
so just target awareness boom one temple

262
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
so just target awareness boom one temple
 

263
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,590
so just target awareness boom one temple
area

264
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
area
 

265
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,950
area
boom orbital socket area three

266
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
boom orbital socket area three
 

267
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,230
boom orbital socket area three
carotid arteries area and boom ribcage

268
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
carotid arteries area and boom ribcage
 

269
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,189
carotid arteries area and boom ribcage
all right let's start

270
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
all right let's start
 

271
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,469
all right let's start
okay then uh uh in this part

272
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
okay then uh uh in this part
 

273
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,189
okay then uh uh in this part
position of this body yeah you might

274
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
position of this body yeah you might
 

275
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,590
position of this body yeah you might
have to play with it a little

276
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
have to play with it a little
 

277
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,950
have to play with it a little
um so for example

278
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
um so for example
 

279
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,749
um so for example
you close the the knife edge into a

280
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
you close the the knife edge into a
 

281
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,629
you close the the knife edge into a
hammer fist

282
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
hammer fist
 

283
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,029
hammer fist
okay and then you're going to have the

284
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
okay and then you're going to have the
 

285
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,150
okay and then you're going to have the
ridge of the nose

286
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
ridge of the nose
 

287
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,350
ridge of the nose
here clavicle here

288
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
here clavicle here
 

289
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,309
here clavicle here
and then so shomonucci's going up up and

290
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
and then so shomonucci's going up up and
 

291
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,230
and then so shomonucci's going up up and
forget this part of the shomunduchi

292
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
forget this part of the shomunduchi
 

293
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,790
forget this part of the shomunduchi
and pay attention to this part boom and

294
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
and pay attention to this part boom and
 

295
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,510
and pay attention to this part boom and
you have your

296
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
you have your
 

297
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,990
you have your
your upward elbow okay so we'll do that

298
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
your upward elbow okay so we'll do that
 

299
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,870
your upward elbow okay so we'll do that
you'll pull

300
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
you'll pull
 

301
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:31,250
you'll pull
ba

302
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,260

 

303
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,350

[Music]

304
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
[Music]
 

305
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,430
[Music]
okay okay so your your strikes can't be

306
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
okay okay so your your strikes can't be
 

307
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,629
okay okay so your your strikes can't be
scoring points uh things must be

308
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
scoring points uh things must be
 

309
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,990
scoring points uh things must be
displaced or destroyed

310
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
displaced or destroyed
 

311
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,590
displaced or destroyed
okay so um

312
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
okay so um
 

313
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,790
okay so um
when i when i uh he's taller than me

314
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
when i when i uh he's taller than me
 

315
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,070
when i when i uh he's taller than me
so if i come up like this uh there's not

316
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
so if i come up like this uh there's not
 

317
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,830
so if i come up like this uh there's not
much power in here because it's higher

318
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
much power in here because it's higher
 

319
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,189
much power in here because it's higher
than i wanted

320
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
than i wanted
 

321
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,990
than i wanted
so that's why i'm bringing him down he's

322
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
so that's why i'm bringing him down he's
 

323
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,350
so that's why i'm bringing him down he's
coming into the elbow

324
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
coming into the elbow
 

325
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,629
coming into the elbow
okay so i then this hand

326
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
okay so i then this hand
 

327
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,629
okay so i then this hand
don't leave with your fingers this is a

328
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
don't leave with your fingers this is a
 

329
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,990
don't leave with your fingers this is a
mascot striker oh

330
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
mascot striker oh
 

331
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,070
mascot striker oh
and i hit there it's a pullman coming in

332
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
and i hit there it's a pullman coming in
 

333
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,430
and i hit there it's a pullman coming in
and hitting okay

334
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
and hitting okay
 

335
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,950
and hitting okay
so it's a plume hit here and at the same

336
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
so it's a plume hit here and at the same
 

337
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,230
so it's a plume hit here and at the same
time coming

338

coming up okay um so you can see like
there's a mass displacement that's

342
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
there's a mass displacement that's
 

343
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,629
there's a mass displacement that's
happening okay

344
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
happening okay
 

345
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,230

and there's gonna be a mass displacement
 

365
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:52,790
and there's gonna be a mass displacement
so

366
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
so

oh i got your clap i called it
 

379
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,510
oh i got your clap i called it
it's a displacing strike okay

380
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
it's a displacing strike okay
 

381
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,869
it's a displacing strike okay
so my my weight is dropping dropping on

382
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
so my my weight is dropping dropping on
 

383

now
 

405
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,920
now
okay it's got to be mass displacing
