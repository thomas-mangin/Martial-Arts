00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,230
kihon so kasushi
uh if you're rotating just around

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
uh if you're rotating just around
 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,070
uh if you're rotating just around
your center that's not the aikido

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
your center that's not the aikido
 

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,789
your center that's not the aikido
position

10
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
position
 

11
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,390
position
so i'm not just tilting

12
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400

 

13
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,070

his his center does tilt

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
his his center does tilt
 

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,750
his his center does tilt
but it traverses

16
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
but it traverses
 

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,150
but it traverses
across the sagittal plane

18
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
across the sagittal plane
 

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,190
across the sagittal plane
okay so here i am and

20
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
okay so here i am and
 

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,110
okay so here i am and
i'm gonna tilt it again do you see

22
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
i'm gonna tilt it again do you see
 

23
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,310
i'm gonna tilt it again do you see
it has to traverse again so

24
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
it has to traverse again so
 

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,350
it has to traverse again so
it's gonna move see

26
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
it's gonna move see
 

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,709
it's gonna move see
all right and the same thing when i do

28
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
all right and the same thing when i do
 

29
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,510
all right and the same thing when i do
so when you're giving me energy this way

30
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
so when you're giving me energy this way
 

31
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,910
so when you're giving me energy this way
when i do the reconciliation

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
when i do the reconciliation
 

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,709
when i do the reconciliation
it's going to move do you see and now

34
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
it's going to move do you see and now
 

35
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,069
it's going to move do you see and now
same thing here

36
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
same thing here
 

37
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:04,469
same thing here
don't tilt it it has to move

38
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479

 

39
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,670

so as you're working your basics

40
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
so as you're working your basics
 

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,350
so as you're working your basics
pay attention warm

42
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
pay attention warm
 

43
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:24,789
pay attention warm
pull

44
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799

 

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,190

and watch the okay that you're not

46
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
and watch the okay that you're not
 

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,830
and watch the okay that you're not
absorbing do you see because you don't

48
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
absorbing do you see because you don't
 

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,950
absorbing do you see because you don't
want to move because when we go quicker

50
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
want to move because when we go quicker
 

51
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,069
want to move because when we go quicker
you move deep see

52
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
you move deep see
 

53
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,950
you move deep see
so if we're going to slow it down stay

54
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
so if we're going to slow it down stay
 

55
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,870
so if we're going to slow it down stay
with the energy

56
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880

 

57
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,190

you're good this reconciliation you'll

58
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
you're good this reconciliation you'll
 

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,149
you're good this reconciliation you'll
move

60
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
move
 

61
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,469
move
not just tilt you're going to move

62
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
not just tilt you're going to move
 

63
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,230
not just tilt you're going to move
you you absorb it in your arm again

64
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
you you absorb it in your arm again
 

65
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,510
you you absorb it in your arm again
right

move the center oh move it again

70
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
move the center oh move it again
 

71
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,950
move the center oh move it again
it's going to absorb move

72
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
it's going to absorb move
 

73
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:18,390
it's going to absorb move
you're trying tilting it again whoa

74
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400

 

75
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:29,910

do you see you can't take

76
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920

 

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,949

okay so she's trying to get up

78
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
okay so she's trying to get up
 

79

do
 

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,229
do
do it like a steady pressure so you can

84
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
do it like a steady pressure so you can
 

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,470

do you understand so over here
 

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,869
do you understand so over here
so what what hap why did you do it then

100
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
so what what hap why did you do it then
 

101
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,630
so what what hap why did you do it then
that's the question

102
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
that's the question
 

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,270
that's the question
you see why do it then let's look at

104
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
you see why do it then let's look at
 

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,910
you see why do it then let's look at
what's happening leave this arm long

106
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
what's happening leave this arm long
 

107
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,830
what's happening leave this arm long
okay and try to get up and do you feel

108
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
okay and try to get up and do you feel
 

109
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,470
okay and try to get up and do you feel
how

110
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
how
 

111
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,229
how
dependent you are yes

112
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239

 

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,030

you see so you you feel your balance

114
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
you see so you you feel your balance
 

115
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,910
you see so you you feel your balance
losing

116
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
losing
 

117
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,509
losing
and you feel it losing here so you

118
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
and you feel it losing here so you
 

119
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,910
and you feel it losing here so you
trying to take that away but you create

120
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
trying to take that away but you create
 

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,670
trying to take that away but you create
the other opening

122
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
the other opening
 

123
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,789
the other opening
so you want to picture that you have to

124
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
so you want to picture that you have to
 

125
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,309
so you want to picture that you have to
defend yourself

126
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
defend yourself
 

127
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,670
defend yourself
you would not take that off

128
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
you would not take that off
 

129
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,030
you would not take that off
okay instead let yourself

130
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
okay instead let yourself
 

131
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,270
okay instead let yourself
fall there you go hi

132
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
fall there you go hi
 

133
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,789
fall there you go hi
which will happen when you actually

134
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
which will happen when you actually
 

135
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,949
which will happen when you actually
try not to let me in on you hi okay

136
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
try not to let me in on you hi okay
 

137
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,910
try not to let me in on you hi okay
so you start to lift up slowly without

138
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
so you start to lift up slowly without
 

139
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,190
so you start to lift up slowly without
taking it away

140
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
taking it away
 

141
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,509
taking it away
and this arm goes like that and you see

142
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
and this arm goes like that and you see
 

143
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,590
and this arm goes like that and you see
she moves

144
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600

 

145
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,629

so here on on

146
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
so here on on
 

147
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,950
so here on on
her yawn move she will move forward

148
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
her yawn move she will move forward
 

149
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,510
her yawn move she will move forward
she will not stay still

150
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
she will not stay still
 

151
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,390
she will not stay still
she's there and i do all this and she's

152
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
she's there and i do all this and she's
 

153
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,430
she's there and i do all this and she's
there

154
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
there
 

155
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,710
there
okay she should be going in a kazushi

156
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
okay she should be going in a kazushi
 

157
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,350
okay she should be going in a kazushi
pattern

158
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
pattern
 

159
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,950
pattern
you did it again

160
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960

 

161
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,150

you can't have your arm changes happen

162
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
you can't have your arm changes happen
 

163
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,189
you can't have your arm changes happen
people waiting so he's gonna

164
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
people waiting so he's gonna
 

165
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,310
people waiting so he's gonna
energy slow she goes don't give

166
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
energy slow she goes don't give
 

167
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,909
energy slow she goes don't give
up hi do you understand

168
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
up hi do you understand
 

169
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,950
up hi do you understand
try it again

170
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960

 

171
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,629

oh there you go and then the technique

172
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
oh there you go and then the technique
 

173
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,230
oh there you go and then the technique
hi again

174
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240

 

175
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,270
