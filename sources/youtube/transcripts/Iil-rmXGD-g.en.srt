00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760

 

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:01:24,830

can i guess

4
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

5

thank you

10
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360

 

11
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,869

okay don't open this up don't go like

12
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
okay don't open this up don't go like
 

13
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,150
okay don't open this up don't go like
that

14
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
that
 

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,830
that
you you move your body and that was

16
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
you you move your body and that was
 

17
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,830
you you move your body and that was
enough see

18
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,630

so boom then that is gonna just roll

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
so boom then that is gonna just roll
 

21
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,949
so boom then that is gonna just roll
from

22
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
from
 

23
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:18,149
from
contact around

24
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159

 

25
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:29,589

okay try it

26
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599

 

27
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:45,589

and then when you're in again

28
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599

 

29
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,589

don't do it with force by not going down

30
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599

 

31
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,710

you're going to ride the energy down

32
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
you're going to ride the energy down
 

33
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,030
you're going to ride the energy down
come around

34
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040

 

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,589

some of you are overshooting the elbow

36
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
some of you are overshooting the elbow
 

37
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,869
some of you are overshooting the elbow
you're going like that

38
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
you're going like that
 

39
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,830
you're going like that
thank you very much they have to work

40
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840

 

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:19,590

boom you're going to like pedal

42
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600

 

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,909

it's just kind of like machio tush here

44
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
it's just kind of like machio tush here
 

45
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,510
it's just kind of like machio tush here
so the hands

46
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
so the hands
 

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:32,790
so the hands
weren't in pedals okay

48
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800

 

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,870

you can't use your arm to get up

50
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880

 

51
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,830

so he punches and that's a different

52
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
so he punches and that's a different
 

53
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,390
so he punches and that's a different
energy picture he brings his arm in

54
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
energy picture he brings his arm in
 

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,830
energy picture he brings his arm in
right he's using it to get up right

56
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
right he's using it to get up right
 

57
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,350
right he's using it to get up right
that's a different energy print i

58
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
that's a different energy print i
 

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,670
that's a different energy print i
wouldn't go you don't go for a cut again

60
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
wouldn't go you don't go for a cut again
 

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,110
wouldn't go you don't go for a cut again
he brings his arm in

62
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
he brings his arm in
 

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,790
he brings his arm in
right and you can come around and make

64
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
right and you can come around and make
 

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,590
right and you can come around and make
it tighter

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
it tighter
 

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,150
it tighter
he brings his arm in is that dinner yang

68
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
he brings his arm in is that dinner yang
 

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,629
he brings his arm in is that dinner yang
yeah

70
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
yeah
 

71
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,189
yeah
he brings his arm in so you have you can

72
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
he brings his arm in so you have you can
 

73
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,390
he brings his arm in so you have you can
go in right

74
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400

 

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,029

so this is just a an abstract version of

76
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
so this is just a an abstract version of
 

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,150
so this is just a an abstract version of
a thrust

78
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
a thrust
 

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,110
a thrust
so he could if this is a knife right if

80
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
so he could if this is a knife right if
 

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,469
so he could if this is a knife right if
he has a knife

82
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
he has a knife
 

83
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,230
he has a knife
i'm not going to go in because that

84
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
i'm not going to go in because that
 

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,150
i'm not going to go in because that
knife is out here

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
knife is out here
 

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,950
knife is out here
so these are just abstractions

88
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
so these are just abstractions
 

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,950
so these are just abstractions
he throws a kick it's the same thing

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
he throws a kick it's the same thing
 

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,390
he throws a kick it's the same thing
okay so don't get confused like uh

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
okay so don't get confused like uh
 

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,990
okay so don't get confused like uh
i'm trying to do a self-defense

94
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
i'm trying to do a self-defense
 

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,749
i'm trying to do a self-defense
technique you're just working with

96
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
technique you're just working with
 

97
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,430
technique you're just working with
linear thrust

98
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
linear thrust
 

99
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,270
linear thrust
you understand so that is the

100
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
you understand so that is the
 

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,270
you understand so that is the
requirement of okay

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
requirement of okay
 

103
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,029
requirement of okay
you cannot upload i have to keep the

104
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
you cannot upload i have to keep the
 

105
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,270
you cannot upload i have to keep the
abstraction going and i can't get up

106
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
abstraction going and i can't get up
 

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,189
abstraction going and i can't get up
like that you understand

108
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
like that you understand
 

109

right okay
if you want some operational fitness you

116
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
if you want some operational fitness you
 

117
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,430
if you want some operational fitness you
should be able to do that

118
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
should be able to do that
 

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,270
should be able to do that
if you can't do that what do you got to

00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
right he has a knife on the other hand
 

139
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,629
right he has a knife on the other hand
he punches me the eye slices me

140
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
he punches me the eye slices me
 

141
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,990
he punches me the eye slices me
okay so when i do the technique i know

142
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
okay so when i do the technique i know
 

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,909
okay so when i do the technique i know
i'm gonna roll him around i can't let

144
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
i'm gonna roll him around i can't let
 

145
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,029
i'm gonna roll him around i can't let
him get up

146
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039

 

147
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,790

and i can't let him come around or i

148
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
and i can't let him come around or i
 

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,150
and i can't let him come around or i
lose my

150
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
lose my
 

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,110
lose my
angle of cancellation so as i'm doing

152
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
angle of cancellation so as i'm doing
 

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,070
angle of cancellation so as i'm doing
the technique

154
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
the technique
 

155
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,110
the technique
i am aware of that

156
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
i am aware of that
 

157
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,670
i am aware of that
you see don't let him up all the way

158
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
you see don't let him up all the way
 

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,589
you see don't let him up all the way
don't let him rest on his back either

160
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
don't let him rest on his back either
 

161
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,909
don't let him rest on his back either
that's the same problem

162
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919

 

163
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,189

so we go

164
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199

 

165
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:17,670

he should go all the way over

166
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
he should go all the way over
 

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,510
he should go all the way over
no time to give up your angle

168
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
no time to give up your angle
 

169
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:28,390
no time to give up your angle

170
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400

 

171
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:49,189

okay let's go

172
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199

 

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280

you
