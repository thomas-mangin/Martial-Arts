a matter of my arms moving there is a
percussiveness to the energy that's

472
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
percussiveness to the energy that's
 

473
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,710
percussiveness to the energy that's
coming coming in and out okay so when i

474

that there's an explosiveness
 

481
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,509
that there's an explosiveness
to

482
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
to
 

483
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,990
