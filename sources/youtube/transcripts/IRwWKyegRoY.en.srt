the wrong place is when he pushes in see

140
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
the wrong place is when he pushes in see
 

141
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,030
the wrong place is when he pushes in see
they felt that hard

142
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
they felt that hard
 

143
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,589
they felt that hard
more it weren't because I was trying it

144
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
more it weren't because I was trying it
 

145
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,270
more it weren't because I was trying it
was because I was in the wrong

146
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
was because I was in the wrong
 

147
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,710
was because I was in the wrong
place so if the angle wrong comes sharp

148
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
place so if the angle wrong comes sharp
 

149
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,509
place so if the angle wrong comes sharp
if the angle's right it becomes

150
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:34,519

 

151
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,670

soft say the angan your body angle to

152
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:38,680
soft say the angan your body angle to
 

153
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,949
soft say the angan your body angle to
them yeah your body angle to them I

154
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:41,959
them yeah your body angle to them I
 

155
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,309
them yeah your body angle to them I
could be at the same

156
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:45,319

 

157
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,350

angle I've changed the angle cuz he

158
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,360
angle I've changed the angle cuz he
 

159
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,270

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,280
changed my angle see so when you push
 

161
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,190
changed my angle see so when you push
soft isn't it yeah and oh I I was about

162
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,200
