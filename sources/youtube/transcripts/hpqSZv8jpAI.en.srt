sometimes we have to give you some

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:01,439
sometimes we have to give you some
 

3
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,990
sometimes we have to give you some
techniques so even though I'm going this

4
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,000
techniques so even though I'm going this
 

5
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,990
techniques so even though I'm going this
way we can go across the body so we'll

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
way we can go across the body so we'll
 

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,810
way we can go across the body so we'll
just say and that will end your punch we

8
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:08,820
just say and that will end your punch we
 

9
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,669
just say and that will end your punch we
can go here

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679

 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,390

but there's one

12
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,400

 

13
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,390

close up the other two

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
close up the other two
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,470
close up the other two
up to the shoulders

16
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:23,480

 

17
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,689

what about this inside out

18
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:26,699
what about this inside out
 

19
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,269
what about this inside out
this one inside out

20
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279

 

21
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,170

um

22
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,180

 

23
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,350

wow

24
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360

 

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,690

you paid them oh thanks you don't do

26
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:41,700
you paid them oh thanks you don't do
 

27
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,090
you paid them oh thanks you don't do
that to me don't ask me to repeat them I

28
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
that to me don't ask me to repeat them I
 

29
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,130
that to me don't ask me to repeat them I
was on a free flow

30
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,140
was on a free flow
 

31
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,229
was on a free flow
so that's what I wanted to do I want to

32
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
so that's what I wanted to do I want to
 

33
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,610
so that's what I wanted to do I want to
try to

34
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
try to
 

35
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,670
try to
stop yourself thinking

36
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
stop yourself thinking
 

37
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,189
stop yourself thinking
if something seems to be there that you

38
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
if something seems to be there that you
 

39
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,069
if something seems to be there that you
can choose

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079

 

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,590

um even if I'm not making sense

42
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
um even if I'm not making sense
 

43
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,229
um even if I'm not making sense
you can see what I've just done

44
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
you can see what I've just done
 

45
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,070
you can see what I've just done
I programmed the techniques and then I

46
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,080
I programmed the techniques and then I
 

47
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,710
I programmed the techniques and then I
saw what come that I could do from that

48
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:09,720
saw what come that I could do from that
 

49
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,670
saw what come that I could do from that
technique

50
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
technique
 

51
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,950
technique
so I started on something

52
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
so I started on something
 

53
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,890
so I started on something
this is a technique that was a technique

54
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:15,900
this is a technique that was a technique
 

55
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,350
this is a technique that was a technique
there's the third one

56
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
there's the third one
 

57
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,810
there's the third one
outside

58
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:20,820
outside
 

59
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,510
outside
why did I pick cartoon angry because

60
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
why did I pick cartoon angry because
 

61
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,670
why did I pick cartoon angry because
when I done that I was actually going to

62
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
when I done that I was actually going to
 

63
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,010
when I done that I was actually going to
do a Sankey opinion but I saw his head

64
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
do a Sankey opinion but I saw his head
 

65
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,429
do a Sankey opinion but I saw his head
so I don't apply to Maggie

66
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
so I don't apply to Maggie
 

67
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,890
so I don't apply to Maggie
but my technical mind said I'll take

68
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
but my technical mind said I'll take
 

69
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,590
but my technical mind said I'll take
this and pin him now

70
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
this and pin him now
 

71
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,429
this and pin him now
I didn't follow my technical line

72
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
I didn't follow my technical line
 

73
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,370
I didn't follow my technical line
oh

74
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,380

 

75
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,190

so it may be hard for some of you to do

76
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
so it may be hard for some of you to do
 

77
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,410
so it may be hard for some of you to do
things that you think know what he's

78
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,420
things that you think know what he's
 

79
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,030
things that you think know what he's
talking about but I don't think my

80
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
talking about but I don't think my
 

81
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,630
talking about but I don't think my
limitations will allow that yet

82
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
limitations will allow that yet
 

83
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,310
limitations will allow that yet
then you'll have to just pose on

84
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
then you'll have to just pose on
 

85
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,889
then you'll have to just pose on
yourself

86
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899

 

87
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,510

the part of that I hope you've noticed

88
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
the part of that I hope you've noticed
 

89
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,870
the part of that I hope you've noticed
without knowing it was every time I went

90
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:05,880
without knowing it was every time I went
 

91
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,370
without knowing it was every time I went
to him a little bit

92
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,380

 

93
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,030

not at any time did I say you come to me

94
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
not at any time did I say you come to me
 

95
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,610
not at any time did I say you come to me
because I'm the winner and you have to

96
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:16,620
because I'm the winner and you have to
 

97
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,490
because I'm the winner and you have to
lose every time what I said was let's

98
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:19,500
lose every time what I said was let's
 

99
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,690
lose every time what I said was let's
sort of join somebody

100
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:23,700

 

101
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,869

see what happens

102
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:25,879
see what happens
 

103
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,270
see what happens
even the dangerous one

104
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
even the dangerous one
 

105
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,630
even the dangerous one
I made sure I went in so deep

106
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
I made sure I went in so deep
 

107
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,309
I made sure I went in so deep
that you've got no chance of actually

108
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
that you've got no chance of actually
 

109

115
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,610

at my foot

116
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620

 

117
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,650

he doesn't need more children as well

118
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:53,660
he doesn't need more children as well
 

119
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,930
he doesn't need more children as well
real slow I met him

120
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:56,940
real slow I met him
 

121
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,670

125
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,830
I went in
and then

126
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
and then
 

127
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
and then
I didn't feel that
