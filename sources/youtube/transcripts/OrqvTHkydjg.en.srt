okay so what we've come up with is these

168
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:09,720
okay so what we've come up with is these
 

169
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,470
okay so what we've come up with is these
rubber ones okay there's some downside

170
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,480
rubber ones okay there's some downside
 

171
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,189
rubber ones okay there's some downside
to them because they kind of Bounce the

172
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
to them because they kind of Bounce the
 

173
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,909
to them because they kind of Bounce the
the wood does bounce off of them but

174
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:18,919
the wood does bounce off of them but
 

175
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,629
the wood does bounce off of them but
when you are trying to learn the

179
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,270
Uki you're going to be trying to absorb
it anyways and so that bounce is not as

180
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,280
it anyways and so that bounce is not as
 

181
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,909
it anyways and so that bounce is not as
pronounced as you think

182
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:30,919
pronounced as you think
 

183
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,510
pronounced as you think
um you also cannot rely on the bouncing

184
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
um you also cannot rely on the bouncing
 

185
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,790
um you also cannot rely on the bouncing
of the nagz bulen or Joe because it's

186
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:39,800
of the nagz bulen or Joe because it's
 

187
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,909
of the nagz bulen or Joe because it's
going to go over the top and hit your

188
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
going to go over the top and hit your

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
going to start yielding to it and you
 

193
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,790
going to start yielding to it and you
don't have a bouncing problem like you

194
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
don't have a bouncing problem like you
 

195
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,830
don't have a bouncing problem like you
might think but this is our highest

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,710
in okay and you see most of our people
are sticking with that and I don't have

204
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
are sticking with that and I don't have
 

205
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,950
are sticking with that and I don't have
a problem with

206
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:05,960

 

207
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,550

that and the next is a little smaller

208
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,560
that and the next is a little smaller
 

209
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,749
that and the next is a little smaller
just I just need a little safety cushion
