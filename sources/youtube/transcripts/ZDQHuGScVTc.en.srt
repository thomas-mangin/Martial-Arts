you're going to learn you are closer you
 

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,189
you're going to learn you are closer you
are closer if if I don't move it all and

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:41,199
are closer if if I don't move it all and
 

19
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:47,240
are closer if if I don't move it all and
give us a move it off but he's he's like

his energy comes in and I try to send it

40
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,360
his energy comes in and I try to send it
 

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,680
his energy comes in and I try to send it
to my feet do you see how much more

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:11,690
to my feet do you see how much more
 

43
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,259
to my feet do you see how much more
movement he's getting out of me watch me

00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:14,269
movement he's getting out of me watch me
 

45
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,320
movement he's getting out of me watch me
do the other one cuz I'm not training

swish and sway
you're not gonna Bend and the energy

56
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:35,959
you're not gonna Bend and the energy
 

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,449
you're not gonna Bend and the energy
you're going to shoot it down to the

58
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:37,459
you're going to shoot it down to the
 

59
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,009
you're going to shoot it down to the
ground you got it got it okay

60
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:41,019
ground you got it got it okay
 

61
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,680
ground you got it got it okay
they try like that he's pushing and I'm

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:44,690
they try like that he's pushing and I'm
 

63
00:02:44,690 --> 00:03:01,150
they try like that he's pushing and I'm
doing that he's also going to be locked

64
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,160
doing that he's also going to be locked
 

65
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,930
doing that he's also going to be locked
so he's gonna change the drill okay I

66
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:04,940
so he's gonna change the drill okay I
 

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,229
so he's gonna change the drill okay I
hear he goes yeah right head towards it

68
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:11,239
hear he goes yeah right head towards it
 

69
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,510

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:16,520

 

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,120

I lock everything out same thing

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,130
I lock everything out same thing
 

73
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,410
I lock everything out same thing
oh he'll move all of me so he's locked

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,140
oh my hands are hurt or lie
I think this stroke I'm going to change

82
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,150
I think this stroke I'm going to change
 

83
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,650
I think this stroke I'm going to change
the tiny comes in see how I let

84
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:35,660
the tiny comes in see how I let
 

85
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,230
the tiny comes in see how I let
him come in he falls into it and then I

86
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,240
him come in he falls into it and then I
 

87
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,660
him come in he falls into it and then I
don't push him back he just hits the

88
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:43,670
don't push him back he just hits the
 

89
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,630
don't push him back he just hits the
ground you understand

90
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,640
ground you understand
 

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,680
ground you understand
so here was here was the other one right

92
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:49,690
so here was here was the other one right
 

93
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,720
so here was here was the other one right
he pushes and I let them come in and

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:52,730
he pushes and I let them come in and
 

95
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,210
he pushes and I let them come in and
then on projection out I see how you

96
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,220
then on projection out I see how you
 

97
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,580
then on projection out I see how you
could hide it in the looking under hand

98
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:57,590
could hide it in the looking under hand
 

99
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,820
could hide it in the looking under hand
this time you comes into me and I just

100
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830
this time you comes into me and I just
 

101

this time you comes into me and I just
let him hit the ground

102
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000

 

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:07:41,570

come on

104
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:41,580

 

105
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,340

but you can see what why did he do that

106
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,350
but you can see what why did he do that
 

107
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,350
but you can see what why did he do that
was it like something hot on the floor

108
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
was it like something hot on the floor
 

109
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,830
was it like something hot on the floor
was the top right he's not just walking

110
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
was the top right he's not just walking
 

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,220
was the top right he's not just walking
through there's a second where he hits

112
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,230
through there's a second where he hits
 

113
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:01,710
through there's a second where he hits
boom so his body's just being his

114
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:01,720
boom so his body's just being his
 

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,060
boom so his body's just being his
balance is taken boom right on the on

116
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,070
balance is taken boom right on the on
 

117
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,540
balance is taken boom right on the on
the ground so let's do a EQ all right

118
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:09,550
the ground so let's do a EQ all right
 

119
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,000
the ground so let's do a EQ all right
we're here and how many notice on the

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,010
we're here and how many notice on the
 

121
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,930
we're here and how many notice on the
slow-motion portions of the technique

122
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:17,940
slow-motion portions of the technique
 

123
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,870
slow-motion portions of the technique
there's that part there's not it doesn't

124
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:21,880
there's that part there's not it doesn't
 

125
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:29,640
there's that part there's not it doesn't
look like this there's this there's a

126

look like this there's this there's a
 

127
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,710
look like this there's this there's a
second where boom

128
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:36,720

 

129
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,710

most what did you do hmm he's hitting

130

most what did you do hmm he's hitting
 

131
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:48,860
most what did you do hmm he's hitting
that background so you can you can

132
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:48,870
that background so you can you can
 

133
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,730
that background so you can you can
experiment for it

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:50,740
experiment for it
 

135
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:59,269
experiment for it
from the other

136
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279

 

137
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,319

well what happened in that spot to rest
