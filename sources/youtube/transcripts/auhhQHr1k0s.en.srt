he hasn't stood up
 

351
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,269
he hasn't stood up
he can't stand up

352
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
he can't stand up
 

353
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,150
he can't stand up
okay

354
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
okay
 

355
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,110
okay
i can do the heel vector or i can do the

356
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
i can do the heel vector or i can do the
 

357
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,269
i can do the heel vector or i can do the
toe vector

358
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
toe vector
 

359
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,870
toe vector
and i don't let him off

360
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
and i don't let him off
 

361
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,949
and i don't let him off
the forearm

362
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
the forearm
 

363
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,350
the forearm
is gonna go around his head

364
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
is gonna go around his head
 

365
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,550
is gonna go around his head
you see

366
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
you see
 

367
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,509
you see
so

368
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
so
 

369
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,670
so
i'm trying to stand up it's my weight

370
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
i'm trying to stand up it's my weight
 

371
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,670
i'm trying to stand up it's my weight
again you see just like heightened

372
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
again you see just like heightened
 

373
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,269
again you see just like heightened
noggin okay and he's going that way i

374
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
noggin okay and he's going that way i
 

375
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,389
noggin okay and he's going that way i
just

376
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
just
 

377
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,750
just
turn that over

378
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
turn that over
 

379
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,070
turn that over
don't let him back up okay

380
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
don't let him back up okay
 

381
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:04,470
don't let him back up okay
go

399
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,710

that's better get you get off your heels

400
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
that's better get you get off your heels
 

401
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,230
that's better get you get off your heels
you're on your heels don't point your

405
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:16,470

get out of his way

406
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480

 

407
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,590

okay
 

409
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,590
okay
this time i am going to do that other

410
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
this time i am going to do that other
 

411
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,829
this time i am going to do that other
version okay but it's a little

412
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
version okay but it's a little
 

413
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,750
version okay but it's a little
differently because i'm not going to be

414
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
differently because i'm not going to be

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,350

on the head

okay
 

419
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,949
okay
so i'm going to throw this forearm like

420
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
so i'm going to throw this forearm like
 

421
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,949
so i'm going to throw this forearm like
that do you see remember the chin strap

that do you see remember the chin strap
 

423
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,630
that do you see remember the chin strap
the chin strap

424
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
the chin strap
 

425
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,870
the chin strap
goes this way

426
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880

 

427
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:54,140

i know i'm not turning him like that

446
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
i know i'm not turning him like that
 

447
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,509
i know i'm not turning him like that
because i don't want him to stand up

448
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
because i don't want him to stand up
 

449
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,829
because i don't want him to stand up
so you have this

450
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
so you have this
 

451
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,949
so you have this
torque

452
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
torque
 

453
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,430
torque
right there in his shoulder you see

454
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
right there in his shoulder you see
 

455
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,150
right there in his shoulder you see
and i make his head go under

456
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
and i make his head go under
 

457
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,870
and i make his head go under
that's what makes him fall

458
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
that's what makes him fall
 

459
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,550
that's what makes him fall
as opposed to

460
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
as opposed to
 

461
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,430
as opposed to
oh

462
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
oh
 

463
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,790
oh
it'll make an arm blow around you see

464
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
it'll make an arm blow around you see
 

465
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,430
it'll make an arm blow around you see
here

466
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440

you see that thing right there

476
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
you see that thing right there
 

477
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,350
you see that thing right there
now now i have a balance

i tried it again get that torque in the
 

483
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,470
i tried it again get that torque in the
scapula mechanism what's up i'm gonna

484
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480

punch him

486
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
punch him
 

487
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,150

you have that rotational torque in your

490
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
you have that rotational torque in your
 

491
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,230
you have that rotational torque in your
strikes right

492
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
strikes right
 

493
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,550
strikes right
say yes yes

494
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
say yes yes
 

495
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,190
say yes yes
uh your rotational torque is everywhere

496
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
uh your rotational torque is everywhere
 

497
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,710
uh your rotational torque is everywhere
it's everywhere

498
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
it's everywhere
 

499
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,069
it's everywhere
everywhere

500
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079

so we're doing this one

506
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
so we're doing this one
 

507
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,150
so we're doing this one
and i'm gonna take this element off i'm

508
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
and i'm gonna take this element off i'm
 

509
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,790
and i'm gonna take this element off i'm
going to go for the chin strap

510
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
going to go for the chin strap
 

511
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,069
going to go for the chin strap
in the with the inward spiral you see

512
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
in the with the inward spiral you see
 

513
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,910
in the with the inward spiral you see
so i'm here and it does

514
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
so i'm here and it does
 

515
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,189
so i'm here and it does
you got it

516
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
you got it
 

517
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,110
you got it
and you can feel it again

518
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
and you can feel it again
 

519
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,470
and you can feel it again
here i'm not moving it over

520
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
here i'm not moving it over
 

521
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,389
here i'm not moving it over
i'm here

522
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
i'm here
 

523
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,430
i'm here
and i'm throwing it over so it goes

524
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
and i'm throwing it over so it goes
 

525
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,949
and i'm throwing it over so it goes
under the arm like in the other

526
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
under the arm like in the other
 

527
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,470
under the arm like in the other
technique remember that okay
