1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,910

so we're trying to get you to the next

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:04,920
so we're trying to get you to the next
 

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,369
so we're trying to get you to the next
level okay

4
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:07,379
level okay
 

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,970
level okay
so marshley I know he had he has to keep

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:10,980
so marshley I know he had he has to keep
 

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,789
so marshley I know he had he has to keep
moving right if he stops then that's

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
moving right if he stops then that's
 

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,430
moving right if he stops then that's
where the person counters because my

10
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
where the person counters because my
 

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,769
where the person counters because my
control points will stop controlling him

12
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:18,779
control points will stop controlling him
 

13
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,650
control points will stop controlling him
he can move around right

14
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:21,660
he can move around right
 

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,210
he can move around right
uh and we know for example that oh my I

16
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,220
uh and we know for example that oh my I
 

17
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,450
uh and we know for example that oh my I
should be able to uh rebound and apply

18
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,460
should be able to uh rebound and apply
 

19
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,229
should be able to uh rebound and apply
the Coq uh we should know if I should

20
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
the Coq uh we should know if I should
 

21
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,510
the Coq uh we should know if I should
not be group dependent here there's

22
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
not be group dependent here there's
 

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,990
not be group dependent here there's
there's an adhesion that I'm using uh I

24
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
there's an adhesion that I'm using uh I
 

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,090
there's an adhesion that I'm using uh I
can move him around okay we know all

26
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,100
can move him around okay we know all
 

27
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,869
can move him around okay we know all
that

28
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
that
 

29
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,510
that
now look where we're at

30
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:44,520
now look where we're at
 

31
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,910
now look where we're at
is

32
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:46,920
is
 

33
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,150
is
in order to do all that or while doing

34
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
in order to do all that or while doing
 

35
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,670
in order to do all that or while doing
all that or concentric with doing all

36
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
all that or concentric with doing all
 

37
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,110
all that or concentric with doing all
that I am rotating the tanden field

38
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
that I am rotating the tanden field
 

39
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,750
that I am rotating the tanden field
uh as described in yesterday's video

40
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
uh as described in yesterday's video
 

41
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,609
uh as described in yesterday's video
okay and that's all your keyhonawasa all

42
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
okay and that's all your keyhonawasa all
 

43
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,550
okay and that's all your keyhonawasa all
of your King on waza is going to do that

44
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
of your King on waza is going to do that
 

45
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,250
of your King on waza is going to do that
if it even if it's not your Keyhole was

46
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,260
if it even if it's not your Keyhole was
 

47
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,710
if it even if it's not your Keyhole was
like you should be doing it okay meaning

48
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
like you should be doing it okay meaning
 

49
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,929
like you should be doing it okay meaning
it's another technique outside of that

50
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:14,939
it's another technique outside of that
 

51
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,670
it's another technique outside of that
curriculum okay

52
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
curriculum okay
 

53
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,070
curriculum okay
still do this okay

54
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
still do this okay
 

55
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,649
still do this okay
so as I go out

56
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
so as I go out
 

57
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,810
so as I go out
that time didn't feel is going to spin

58
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:23,820
that time didn't feel is going to spin
 

59
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,010
that time didn't feel is going to spin
to the right

60
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,020
to the right
 

61
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,109
to the right
going up

62
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
going up
 

63
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,170
going up
turning to the left and going down

64
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,180
turning to the left and going down
 

65
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,190
turning to the left and going down
it's the exact here's kokidosa and it go

66
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
it's the exact here's kokidosa and it go
 

67
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,410
it's the exact here's kokidosa and it go
I'm going to throw them to the left so

68
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
I'm going to throw them to the left so
 

69
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,710
I'm going to throw them to the left so
the energy field goes to the right goes

70
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
the energy field goes to the right goes
 

71
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,870
the energy field goes to the right goes
up turns to the left and goes down

72
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
up turns to the left and goes down
 

73
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,730
up turns to the left and goes down
all that's happening same thing here

74
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:48,740
all that's happening same thing here
 

75
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,249
all that's happening same thing here
okay now I'm coming in

76
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:52,259
okay now I'm coming in
 

77
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,429
okay now I'm coming in
right and I'm gonna do this same thing

78
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
right and I'm gonna do this same thing
 

79
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,429
right and I'm gonna do this same thing
again on this arm on actually the same

80
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
again on this arm on actually the same
 

81
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,749
again on this arm on actually the same
side okay Boom come around and now your

82
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:02,759
side okay Boom come around and now your
 

83
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,310
side okay Boom come around and now your
technique's gonna have you do it on the

84
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
technique's gonna have you do it on the
 

85
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,010
technique's gonna have you do it on the
other side so I come back

86
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020
other side so I come back
 

87
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,410
other side so I come back
come back coming up and around and down

88
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,420
come back coming up and around and down
 

89
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,369
come back coming up and around and down
now the trick is that I don't ever stop

90
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:16,379
now the trick is that I don't ever stop
 

91
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:28,750
now the trick is that I don't ever stop
that spinning of that energy

92
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760

 

93
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,830

doesn't stop

94
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840

 

95
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,070

I don't stop

96
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080

 

97
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,790

that tonden field

98
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:43,800

 

99
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:53,750

is constantly rotating

100
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760

 

101
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,170

in that rotating crossbar

102
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
in that rotating crossbar
 

103
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,150
in that rotating crossbar
both sides

104
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,160
both sides
 

105
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:23,770
both sides
bone directions I mean

106
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:23,780

 

107
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,610

so the energetic component is concentric

108
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:28,620
so the energetic component is concentric
 

109
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,149
so the energetic component is concentric
with the physical component which means

110
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
with the physical component which means
 

111
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,170
with the physical component which means
that the energetic component

112
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,180
that the energetic component
 

113
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,330
that the energetic component
is concentric with the Marshall

114
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
is concentric with the Marshall
 

115
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,910
is concentric with the Marshall
component

116
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
component
 

117
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,030
component
so what I'm seeing here is as you become

118
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
so what I'm seeing here is as you become
 

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,390
so what I'm seeing here is as you become
fixated on the arm and you stop the

120
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
fixated on the arm and you stop the
 

121
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,369
fixated on the arm and you stop the
energetic component

122
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:52,379
energetic component
 

123
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,770
energetic component
this arm is now on the right side

124
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:57,780
this arm is now on the right side
 

125
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,449
this arm is now on the right side
of my Center can you see that right and

126
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,459
of my Center can you see that right and
 

127
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,710
of my Center can you see that right and
I can't get this step from where I'm at

128
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
I can't get this step from where I'm at
 

129
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,610
I can't get this step from where I'm at
to actually have this elbow on my Center

130
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:09,620
to actually have this elbow on my Center
 

131
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,949
to actually have this elbow on my Center
so she would have the Marshall Advantage

132
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
so she would have the Marshall Advantage
 

133
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,170
so she would have the Marshall Advantage
because I don't have an angle

134
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,180
because I don't have an angle
 

135
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,530
because I don't have an angle
cancellation on this arm this arm was

136
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:18,540
cancellation on this arm this arm was
 

137
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,990
cancellation on this arm this arm was
supposed to be over here now I have the

138
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,000
supposed to be over here now I have the
 

139
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,450
supposed to be over here now I have the
angle cancellation via the arm over here

140
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,460
angle cancellation via the arm over here
 

141
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,290
angle cancellation via the arm over here
I don't you see and then

142
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,300
I don't you see and then
 

143
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,930
I don't you see and then
energetically when I try to step it all

144
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:29,940
energetically when I try to step it all
 

145
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,129
energetically when I try to step it all
falls apart you see and I stepped into

146
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,139
falls apart you see and I stepped into
 

147
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,370
falls apart you see and I stepped into
her available line of attack and she has

148
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,380
her available line of attack and she has
 

149
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,070
her available line of attack and she has
the mechanical advantage she's just get

150
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
the mechanical advantage she's just get
 

151
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,570
the mechanical advantage she's just get
up he's

152
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,580

 

153
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,050

so I just

154
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,060

 

155
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,090

I just and you're always now in the

156
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,100
I just and you're always now in the
 

157
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,370
I just and you're always now in the
right place you see you see how I did

158
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,380
right place you see you see how I did
 

159
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,010
right place you see you see how I did
that and then the same thing happens

160
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,020
that and then the same thing happens
 

161
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,890
that and then the same thing happens
here when you go for the arm

162
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900

 

163
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,770

you stop the energetic pattern

164
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:03,780
you stop the energetic pattern
 

165
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,530
you stop the energetic pattern
you see you just push this down

166
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:06,540
you see you just push this down
 

167
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,050
you see you just push this down
go back where we were

168
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,060
go back where we were
 

169
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,790
go back where we were
