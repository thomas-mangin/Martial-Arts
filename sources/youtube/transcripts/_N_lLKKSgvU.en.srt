under my Center gets over the elbow at
 

137
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,590
under my Center gets over the elbow at
the same time his elbow gets under my

138
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600

 

139
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,909

the next one that I want when you when
you get the x pattern it's impossible

164
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
you get the x pattern it's impossible
 

165
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,710
you get the x pattern it's impossible
for him to stay on that foot you get it

00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:24,199
it one more time that foot is the
 

171
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,110
it one more time that foot is the
problem that's what he's standing on so

172
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,120
problem that's what he's standing on so
 

173
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,390
problem that's what he's standing on so
you're going to take out you're going to

174
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400
you're going to take out you're going to
 

175
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,350
you're going to take out you're going to
take out that basic support you can take

176
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
take out that basic support you can take
 

177
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,110
take out that basic support you can take
this line and gravity off okay but the

178
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,120
this line and gravity off okay but the
 

179
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,029
this line and gravity off okay but the
part I want you to

180
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:36,039
part I want you to
 

181
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,510
part I want you to
understand is make sure that when you

understand is make sure that when you
 

183
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,430
understand is make sure that when you
put this under you that where is under

where is under you or where you are over
 

187
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,749
where is under you or where you are over
is not leaving the line of gravity on

188
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
is not leaving the line of gravity on
 

189
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,150
is not leaving the line of gravity on
that foot okay so you're you're not

190
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
that foot okay so you're you're not
 

191
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,270
that foot okay so you're you're not
going

192
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
going
 

193
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,469
going
here you're you are going to ever so

194
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
here you're you are going to ever so
 

195
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,189
here you're you are going to ever so
slightly

196
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:00,199
slightly
 

197
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,710
slightly
attack That

198
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
attack That
 

199
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,510
attack That
Base you get it there that's the line my

200
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
Base you get it there that's the line my
 

201
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,309
Base you get it there that's the line my
line of gravity is on that Bas of

202
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
line of gravity is on that Bas of
 

203
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,029
line of gravity is on that Bas of
support I want his line of gravity off

204
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
support I want his line of gravity off
 

205
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,350
support I want his line of gravity off
of that Bas of support and I use my

206
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,360
of that Bas of support and I use my
 

207
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:23,029
of that Bas of support and I use my
hands my Tachi to do it

208
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039

 

209
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,270

okay but not in Ur

210
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,280

 

211
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,990

I had to do everything we just did up

212
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
I had to do everything we just did up
 

213
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,629
I had to do everything we just did up
until now but there's an

214
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
until now but there's an
 

215
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,990
until now but there's an
extension

216
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,000
extension
 

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,350
extension
here okay got it all right okay so H how

218
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
here okay got it all right okay so H how
 

219
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,189
here okay got it all right okay so H how
far you do

220
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
far you do
 

221
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,309
far you do
that has to do with did I get on the

222
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:49,319
that has to do with did I get on the
 

223
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,749
that has to do with did I get on the
other side of his elbow okay so no I

224
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:54,759
other side of his elbow okay so no I
 

225
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,950
other side of his elbow okay so no I
didn't here I'm on the other side

226
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
didn't here I'm on the other side
 

227
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,749
didn't here I'm on the other side
meaning for example if if I want I can

228
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:00,759
meaning for example if if I want I can
 

229
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,629
meaning for example if if I want I can
start pushing that into the dislocation

230
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
start pushing that into the dislocation
 

231
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,230
start pushing that into the dislocation
okay but that that attack angle is what

232
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
okay but that that attack angle is what
 

233
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,230
okay but that that attack angle is what
makes the next move attack this way as

234
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
makes the next move attack this way as
 

235
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,790
makes the next move attack this way as
opposed to just moving the arm okay so

236
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:15,800
opposed to just moving the arm okay so
 

237
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,110
opposed to just moving the arm okay so
when you say this when you come

238
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,120
when you say this when you come
 

239
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,270
when you say this when you come
around there's a this way okay that we

240
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
around there's a this way okay that we
 

241
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,950
around there's a this way okay that we
let go for our partner But the teacher

242
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
let go for our partner But the teacher
 

243
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,869
let go for our partner But the teacher
can tell like I can tell you're not

244
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:30,879
can tell like I can tell you're not
 

245
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,469
can tell like I can tell you're not
there do you see and you come around

246
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
there do you see and you come around
 

247
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,629
there do you see and you come around
that way all right but when you when

248
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:35,639
that way all right but when you when
 

249
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,950
that way all right but when you when
you're here and you get here I can tell

250
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
you're here and you get here I can tell
 

251
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,350
you're here and you get here I can tell
oh yeah that's going that way okay and

252
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
oh yeah that's going that way okay and
 

253
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,390
oh yeah that's going that way okay and
then we just let it go for training all

254
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400

 

255
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,469

right so you're going to do everything

256
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
right so you're going to do everything
 

257
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,350
right so you're going to do everything
boom off that leg but I still have that

258
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,360
boom off that leg but I still have that
 

259
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,830
boom off that leg but I still have that
attack angle when I come in you can see

260
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840
attack angle when I come in you can see
 

261
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,390
attack angle when I come in you can see
this way boom Let It Go for him let him

262
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400

 

263
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,670

move okay it's all in you can you feel

264
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:12,680
move okay it's all in you can you feel
 

265
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,869
move okay it's all in you can you feel
that you could press that elbow against

266
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:15,879
that you could press that elbow against
 

267
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,189
that you could press that elbow against
the shoulder and the wrist line okay

268
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
the shoulder and the wrist line okay
 

269
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,350
the shoulder and the wrist line okay
teacher knows too okay right notice that

270
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:22,360
teacher knows too okay right notice that
 

271
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,990
teacher knows too okay right notice that
the form changes levels

272
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,000
the form changes levels
 

273
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,909
the form changes levels
okay

274
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:26,919
okay
 

275
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,270
okay
so if you pay attention

276
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,280
so if you pay attention
 

277
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,990
so if you pay attention
I'm coming off of it do you see do you

278
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm coming off of it do you see do you
 

279
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,709
I'm coming off of it do you see do you
see that I'm not I'm not here all

280
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
see that I'm not I'm not here all
 

281
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,990
see that I'm not I'm not here all
right so it's telling you when the move

282
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
right so it's telling you when the move
 

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,190
right so it's telling you when the move
is moving into its in Phase you have to

284
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,200
is moving into its in Phase you have to
 

285
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,310
is moving into its in Phase you have to
stay up with it

286
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
stay up with it
 

287
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,030
stay up with it
okay

288
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,040

 

289
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,990

so see how I stay up with it it's it's

290
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,000
so see how I stay up with it it's it's
 

291
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,310
so see how I stay up with it it's it's
not that

292
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
not that
 

293
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,710
not that
I'm shoving him down he already got

294
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm shoving him down he already got
 

295
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm shoving him down he already got
taken down I'm now on the joint okay

296
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
taken down I'm now on the joint okay
 

297
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,670
taken down I'm now on the joint okay
the reason you lose the

298
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:02,680
the reason you lose the
 

299
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,190
the reason you lose the
joint is because you were bracing on the

300
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,200
joint is because you were bracing on the
 

301
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,230
joint is because you were bracing on the
displacement you see so you have to wait

302
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
displacement you see so you have to wait
 

303
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,269
displacement you see so you have to wait
for that weight to get off of you then

304
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
for that weight to get off of you then
 

305
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,069
for that weight to get off of you then
decide it's time to enter and that's how

306
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:14,079
decide it's time to enter and that's how
 

307
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,990
decide it's time to enter and that's how
it gaps on your palm heel if you keep

308
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,000
it gaps on your palm heel if you keep
 

309
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,550
it gaps on your palm heel if you keep
the feeling and you're grounding

310
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,560
the feeling and you're grounding
 

311
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,269
the feeling and you're grounding
appropriately you just stay up moving

312
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:22,279
appropriately you just stay up moving
 

313
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,069
appropriately you just stay up moving
with the feeling and it never gaps okay

314
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:26,079
with the feeling and it never gaps okay
 

315
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,870
with the feeling and it never gaps okay
but he's going down because he was

316
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
but he's going down because he was
 

317
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,069
but he's going down because he was
falling down and I'm just aiming what's

318
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:31,079
falling down and I'm just aiming what's
 

319
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,150
falling down and I'm just aiming what's
falling do you get that it's already

320
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,160
falling do you get that it's already
 

321
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,870
falling do you get that it's already
fallen I'm aiming it as opposed to

322
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:35,880
fallen I'm aiming it as opposed to
 

323
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,590
fallen I'm aiming it as opposed to
taking it down or letting it rest at the

324
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:38,600
taking it down or letting it rest at the
 

325
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,069
taking it down or letting it rest at the
bottom both are

326
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
bottom both are
 

327
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,079
bottom both are
incorrect okay
