I am Miyamoto from Hombu

00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,716

29
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,813
Having been promoted by Doshu,

30

I feel a strong sense of responsibility

31
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,314
I would like to thank the various teachers and sempai.

32
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,440
Also,

33
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,485
having been promoted in you presence,

34
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:41,364
it is a true honor,

35
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,242
and something I will not forget for the rest of my life.

36
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,162
Aikido training is Katageiko,

37
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,560
there is a lot of repetition of the same things,

38
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,420
but I noticed that even within that repetition, one discovers new things.

39
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,006
Aikido cannot be done alone.

40
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:03,220
I will likely rely upon you many occasions and look forward to keep training with you.

41
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,971
Thank you very much.

42
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,063
Thank you very much Miyamoto Sensei.

43
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,484
Now, coming from France, please welcome

44
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,986
Christian Tissier Sensei.

45
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:30,705
Doshu, Dojo-cho, Tada Sensei, all the Sensei, thank you very much.

46
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:40,131
I entered Hombu Dojo 47 years ago

47
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:49,391
and since that time, I have been faithful to the Ueshiba family.

48
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:56,273
From today, and tomorrow, I will continue to give my very best for Aikido.

49
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,649
Thank you very much.
