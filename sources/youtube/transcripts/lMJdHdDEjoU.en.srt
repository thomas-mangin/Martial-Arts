1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870

um

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:00,880
um
 

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,310
um
but we're going to go back to the

4
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
but we're going to go back to the
 

5
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,309
but we're going to go back to the
katakatama

6
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
katakatama
 

7
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,150
katakatama
seminar okay

8
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
seminar okay
 

9
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,430
seminar okay
all right

10
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
all right
 

11
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,549
all right
so

12
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
so
 

13
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,509
so
uh if i'm going to attack an arm as in

14
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
uh if i'm going to attack an arm as in
 

15
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,150
uh if i'm going to attack an arm as in
katakatame

16
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
katakatame
 

17
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,230
katakatame
there's a couple of things one i have to

18
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
there's a couple of things one i have to
 

19
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,070
there's a couple of things one i have to
isolate the arm

20
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
isolate the arm
 

21
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,990
isolate the arm
it can't be

22
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000

 

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950

so defendable with the other arm or his

24
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
so defendable with the other arm or his
 

25
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,990
so defendable with the other arm or his
body or something like that and two

26
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
body or something like that and two
 

27
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,589
body or something like that and two
uh i don't

28
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
uh i don't
 

29
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,830
uh i don't
i don't grab the arm

30
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
i don't grab the arm
 

31
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,630
i don't grab the arm
the arm lands in the trap

32
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
the arm lands in the trap
 

33
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,110
the arm lands in the trap
okay so uh

34
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
okay so uh
 

35
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,470
okay so uh
let's say

36
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
let's say
 

37
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,389
let's say
um

38
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
um
 

39
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,310
um
for example

40
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
for example
 

41
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,990
for example
uh he's in my closed guard right

42
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
uh he's in my closed guard right
 

43
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,190
uh he's in my closed guard right
and uh he's trying to work something

44
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
and uh he's trying to work something
 

45
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,310
and uh he's trying to work something
right

46
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
right
 

47
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,510
right
and he's i don't do whatever okay so

48
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
and he's i don't do whatever okay so
 

49
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,389
and he's i don't do whatever okay so
here

50
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
here
 

51
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,270
here
uh

52
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
uh
 

53
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,670
uh
i'll i did the knee pull

54
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
i'll i did the knee pull
 

55
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,709
i'll i did the knee pull
do you see

56
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
do you see
 

57
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,630
do you see
and this arm i can start to isolate it

58
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
and this arm i can start to isolate it
 

59
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,550
and this arm i can start to isolate it
as i shield the other arm

60
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
as i shield the other arm
 

61
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,910
as i shield the other arm
from

62
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
from
 

63
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,230
from
with my body do you see that

64
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
with my body do you see that
 

65
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,030
with my body do you see that
and then this is the trap

66
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
and then this is the trap
 

67
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,870
and then this is the trap
i'm not going to grab it i'm in the trap

68
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
i'm not going to grab it i'm in the trap
 

69
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,109
i'm not going to grab it i'm in the trap
it's how i cap the arm and then i can

70
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
it's how i cap the arm and then i can
 

71
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,030
it's how i cap the arm and then i can
find the technique

72
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
find the technique
 

73
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,030
find the technique
over here

74
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040

 

75
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,270

likewise

76
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
likewise
 

77
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,830
likewise
i'm going to isolate his arm

78
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
i'm going to isolate his arm
 

79
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,149
i'm going to isolate his arm
and then i'm going to create a trap

80
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
and then i'm going to create a trap
 

81
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,710
and then i'm going to create a trap
and then the fly lands in the trap i do

82
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
and then the fly lands in the trap i do
 

83
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,190
and then the fly lands in the trap i do
not grab the arm okay

84
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
not grab the arm okay
 

85
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,310
not grab the arm okay
so in kihon maza

86
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
so in kihon maza
 

87
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,109
so in kihon maza
unlike in that example i'm not isolating

88
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
unlike in that example i'm not isolating
 

89
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,950
unlike in that example i'm not isolating
the arm by shielding it with my body

90
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
the arm by shielding it with my body
 

91
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,190
the arm by shielding it with my body
i'm going to isolate the arm

92
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
i'm going to isolate the arm
 

93
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,630
i'm going to isolate the arm
with a

94
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
with a
 

95
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,670
with a
uh

96
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
uh
 

97
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,510
uh
shikaku

98
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
shikaku
 

99
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,109
shikaku
this

100
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
this
 

101
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,630
this
you see

102
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
you see
 

103
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,270
you see
you can do it in gross movements of

104
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
you can do it in gross movements of
 

105
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,469
you can do it in gross movements of
course

106
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479

 

107
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,070

it's isolated now

108
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080

 

109
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,150

and you can do it in with your cochlear

110
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
and you can do it in with your cochlear
 

111
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,510
and you can do it in with your cochlear
projector

112
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
projector
 

113
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,750
projector
it's isolated now okay

114
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760

 

115
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,229

so that's the first thing when we do the

116
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
so that's the first thing when we do the
 

117
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,070
so that's the first thing when we do the
isolation

118
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
isolation
 

119
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,309
isolation
we're always going to take him into this

120
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
we're always going to take him into this
 

121
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,949
we're always going to take him into this
front inward kazushi because it

122
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
front inward kazushi because it
 

123
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,509
front inward kazushi because it
generates the angle cancellation on the

124
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
generates the angle cancellation on the
 

125
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,710
generates the angle cancellation on the
other arm

126
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
other arm
 

127
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,589
other arm
which isolates this one okay

128
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
which isolates this one okay
 

129
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,509
which isolates this one okay
so i'm not going to do a kazushi this

130
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
so i'm not going to do a kazushi this
 

131
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,949
so i'm not going to do a kazushi this
way

132
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
way
 

133
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,350
way
i want the angle cancellation

134
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360

 

135
00:02:45,360 --> 00:03:01,110

and there's the arm

136
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120

 

137
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,550

okay so that's our first part isolate

138
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
okay so that's our first part isolate
 

139
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,470
okay so that's our first part isolate
the arm with the angle of cancellation

140
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
the arm with the angle of cancellation
 

141
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,630
the arm with the angle of cancellation
using a coq projection okay

142
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640

 

143
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,869

so there are many trapping models

144
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
so there are many trapping models
 

145
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,869
so there are many trapping models
but the key basic one you want are these

146
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
but the key basic one you want are these
 

147
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,229
but the key basic one you want are these
open-ended triangles okay

148
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
open-ended triangles okay
 

149
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,589
open-ended triangles okay
uh so if you paid attention

150
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
uh so if you paid attention
 

151
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,789
uh so if you paid attention
when i was here and i came around move

152
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
when i was here and i came around move
 

153
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,309
when i was here and i came around move
out of the way

154
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
out of the way
 

155
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,430
out of the way
that was the trap that's my open-ended

156
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
that was the trap that's my open-ended
 

157
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,229
that was the trap that's my open-ended
triangles okay it could be this way it

158
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
triangles okay it could be this way it
 

159
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,550
triangles okay it could be this way it
could be this way

160
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
could be this way
 

161
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,229
could be this way
that is the

162
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
that is the
 

163
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,750
that is the
best way

164
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
best way
 

165
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,030
best way
of

166
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
of
 

167
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,270
of
creating a trap

168
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
creating a trap
 

169
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,750
creating a trap
which means as a trap what it means is i

170
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
which means as a trap what it means is i
 

171
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,550
which means as a trap what it means is i
don't chase the thing the thing lands in

172
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
don't chase the thing the thing lands in
 

173
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,470
don't chase the thing the thing lands in
the trap okay

174
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
the trap okay
 

175
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,390
the trap okay
so uh as i isolate the arm

176
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
so uh as i isolate the arm
 

177
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,949
so uh as i isolate the arm
