that com
the I'm away so so this is the

22
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,520
the I'm away so so this is the
 

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,670
the I'm away so so this is the
importance of why so that comes from a

24
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
importance of why so that comes from a
 

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,430
importance of why so that comes from a
famous sword

26
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
famous sword

master and he shows this I don't know if
he's still on YouTube but but I've got

30
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
he's still on YouTube but but I've got
 

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,790
he's still on YouTube but but I've got
the film and he shows you how he takes

00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
speed it shows just how he can save
 

37
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,950
speed it shows just how he can save
himself and that's why we need the Massi

38
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,960
himself and that's why we need the Massi
 

39
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,749
himself and that's why we need the Massi
because his MBI is he's realizing he

40
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:13,759
because his MBI is he's realizing he
 

41
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,429
because his MBI is he's realizing he
takes it way gets his sword back so he's

42
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
takes it way gets his sword back so he's
 

43
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,390
takes it way gets his sword back so he's
doing one

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:24,600

 

49
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,069

trick this is

50
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,079
trick this is
 

51
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,590
trick this is
why it's important

52
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:30,600
why it's important
 

53
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,389
why it's important
correct he

54
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:32,399
correct he
 

55
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,710
correct he

that before it
 

67
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,149
that before it
turns he doesn't want to feel as if he's

68
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159
turns he doesn't want to feel as if he's
 

69
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,190
turns he doesn't want to feel as if he's
here and he's

70
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
here and he's

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,149
here and he's
being drag he's holding me off really

72
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
being drag he's holding me off really
 

73

being drag he's holding me off really
trul he feels like like he's out

74
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:02,600
trul he feels like like he's out
 

75
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,670
trul he feels like like he's out

escaping not not not uhing

78
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040

 

79
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,790

me he comes to the middle of his hands

80
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
me he comes to the middle of his hands

00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
with his body and then it turns and that
 

83
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,550
with his body and then it turns and that
makes it so this comes here it feels

84
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
makes it so this comes here it feels
 

85
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:44,110
makes it so this comes here it feels
very deep but he's feeling from here

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,120

 

87
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:54,949

the number

88
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959

 

89
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,869

four go like thisor so here it was the

90
00:02:59,869 --> 00:02:59,879
four go like thisor so here it was the
 

91
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,710
four go like thisor so here it was the
he would do that that be a GU you

92
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
he would do that that be a GU you
 

93
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,430
he would do that that be a GU you
would so this is where the weapons start

94
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
would so this is where the weapons start

this

114
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:36,920

 

115
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,239

is it's got the G movement in
