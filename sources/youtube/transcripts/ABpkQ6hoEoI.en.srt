movement
 

259
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,249
movement
and now follow that dropping sinking

260
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:49,259
and now follow that dropping sinking
 

261
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,129
and now follow that dropping sinking
line down

262
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:52,139

 

263
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,650

you guys see how I'm doing that I should

264
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,660
you guys see how I'm doing that I should

you guys see how I'm doing that I should
know what that feels like and where and

266
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:56,520
know what that feels like and where and
 

267
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,370
know what that feels like and where and
there and therefore I know where it is

268
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
there and therefore I know where it is
 

269
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,590
there and therefore I know where it is
and that's the line that I followed down

270
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:00,600
and that's the line that I followed down
 

271
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,730
and that's the line that I followed down
okay

272
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:01,740
okay
 

273
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,790
okay
then hey D come back up that line so

274
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
then hey D come back up that line so
 

275
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,010
then hey D come back up that line so
young on that line Dave Young on that

276
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
young on that line Dave Young on that
 

277

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,329
this is a training tool
and all training paradigms are about the

351
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,250

so sooner or later it's going to do

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
so sooner or later it's going to do
 

353
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,009
so sooner or later it's going to do
something

355
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,470

that will probably break your ability to

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,480
that will probably break your ability to
 

357
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,829
that will probably break your ability to
do the drill

359
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,930

and then with pre-modern training

so you're going to be challenged in
 

367
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,310
so you're going to be challenged in

from a material point of view okay but
 

387
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,910
from a material point of view okay but
right away you see the drill goes hey if

you should be able to go up and still

398
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:15,899
you should be able to go up and still

401
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,370
sink so I am going up my body's going up
but I don't lose the sinking feeling

402

but I don't lose the sinking feeling
 

403
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,769

is

408
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,260
is
 

409
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,070
is
your Sinking Feeling should be down

410
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,080
your Sinking Feeling should be down

but now you have a Target

414
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:35,640
but now you have a Target
 

415
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,150
but now you have a Target
and the target will pull your mind

416
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
and the target will pull your mind
 

417
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,910
and the target will pull your mind
and as it pulls your mind why why will

418
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
and as it pulls your mind why why will
 

419
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,190
and as it pulls your mind why why will
it pull your mind because your ego

420

tripartite mind is functioning so the
 

423
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,170
tripartite mind is functioning so the
desire to hit the target will pull your

424
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,180
desire to hit the target will pull your
 

425
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,050
desire to hit the target will pull your
mind and now let's just materially

426
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,060
mind and now let's just materially
 

427
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,569

now you have a gravity here and you
 

433
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,250
now you have a gravity here and you
start to tilt do you see well now you're

434
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,260
start to tilt do you see well now you're
 

435
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,889
start to tilt do you see well now you're
not sinking so it looks something like

436
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
not sinking so it looks something like
 

437
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,590
not sinking so it looks something like
this so you go here and

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:06,600
this so you go here and
 

439
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,690
this so you go here and
now you're not sinking you actually came

440
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:08,700
now you're not sinking you actually came
 

441
