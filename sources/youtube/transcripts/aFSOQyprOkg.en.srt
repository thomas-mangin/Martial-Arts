going into that shoulder impingement and
 

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,869
going into that shoulder impingement and
he'll fall

72
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
he'll fall

you don't check somebody and then
 

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,789
you don't check somebody and then
uncheck him to check him

100
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
uncheck him to check him

makes no martial sense at all
 

141
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,390
makes no martial sense at all
okay let's go

142
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400

his body goes down you protect his head
move out of the way

152
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
move out of the way
 

153
00:04:40,960 --> 00:05:01,029
move out of the way
and you find flat control

155
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,629

so of course this is this technique

156
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
so of course this is this technique
 

157
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,830
so of course this is this technique
but you can't do that you'll break his
