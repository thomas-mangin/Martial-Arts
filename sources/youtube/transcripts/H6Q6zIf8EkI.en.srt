carrying on from

00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:03,419
carrying on from
 

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,889
carrying on from
the observation

4
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:06,899

 

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,250

we all observe at times I think it

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,260
we all observe at times I think it
 

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,509
we all observe at times I think it
doesn't matter where I've been in the

8
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
doesn't matter where I've been in the
 

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,910
doesn't matter where I've been in the
world you'll get students they perhaps

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
world you'll get students they perhaps
 

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,250
world you'll get students they perhaps
late for class but they want to be there

12
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,260
late for class but they want to be there
 

13
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,390
late for class but they want to be there
so they watch class or you know perhaps

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
so they watch class or you know perhaps
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,150
so they watch class or you know perhaps
yourself you've had an injury you still

16
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
yourself you've had an injury you still
 

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,429
yourself you've had an injury you still
go to class you sit on the

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
go to class you sit on the
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,310
go to class you sit on the
on the edge of the mat

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
on the edge of the mat
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,189
on the edge of the mat
and you watch the teacher show the

22
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
and you watch the teacher show the
 

23
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,310
and you watch the teacher show the
techniques the students get out and they

24
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
techniques the students get out and they
 

25
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,889
techniques the students get out and they
perform the techniques the teacher walks

26
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:36,899
perform the techniques the teacher walks
 

27
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,850
perform the techniques the teacher walks
over

28
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:37,860
over
 

29
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,490
over
to the student because they are part of

30
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:40,500
to the student because they are part of
 

31
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,450
to the student because they are part of
the class so you make conversation

32
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,460
the class so you make conversation
 

33
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,330
the class so you make conversation
and the one question I've had

34
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,340
and the one question I've had
 

35
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,410
and the one question I've had
over all the years I've been teaching

36
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,420
over all the years I've been teaching
 

37
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,750
over all the years I've been teaching
and the don't matter what country I've

38
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
and the don't matter what country I've
 

39
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,830
and the don't matter what country I've
been in the question is the same

40
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
been in the question is the same
 

41
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,689
been in the question is the same
essentially why are they not doing what

42
00:00:59,689 --> 00:00:59,699
essentially why are they not doing what
 

43
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,270
essentially why are they not doing what
we've just shown

44
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
we've just shown
 

45
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,289
we've just shown
and it's very odd that um

46
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:06,299
and it's very odd that um
 

47
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,050
and it's very odd that um
when we're an observer

48
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,060
when we're an observer
 

49
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,230
when we're an observer
we see something completely different to

50
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
we see something completely different to
 

51
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,450
we see something completely different to
what the students do who have actually

52
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
what the students do who have actually
 

53
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,490
what the students do who have actually
training on the map

54
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:16,500
training on the map
 

55
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,170
training on the map
I don't know why this is a phenomena I

56
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,180
I don't know why this is a phenomena I
 

57
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,990
I don't know why this is a phenomena I
don't know why it happens but it happens

58
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
don't know why it happens but it happens
 

59
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,390
don't know why it happens but it happens
so

60
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
so
 

61
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,870
so
I encourage you all at times to be an

62
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:29,880
I encourage you all at times to be an
 

63
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,130
I encourage you all at times to be an
observer

perhapsely make yourself an observer
 

73
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,670
perhapsely make yourself an observer
you know so when you're looking at what

74
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
you know so when you're looking at what
 

75
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,429
you know so when you're looking at what
they're doing try to not sort of look as

76
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
they're doing try to not sort of look as
 

77
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,310
they're doing try to not sort of look as

115
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,589
what we're trying to do is we're trying
to get the structure of the techniques

116
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
to get the structure of the techniques
 

117
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,449
to get the structure of the techniques
and the techniques we put into our

118
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:49,459
and the techniques we put into our
 

119
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,970
and the techniques we put into our
understanding are being the way we move

of learning and trying to get closer
so today the observation is when I watch

126
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:05,959
so today the observation is when I watch
 

127
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,850
so today the observation is when I watch

so my observation is I'll see people you

156
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:51,299
so my observation is I'll see people you
 

157
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,250
so my observation is I'll see people you
know that

158
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
know that
 

159
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,089
know that
um about I've taped their sword and they

160
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:56,099
um about I've taped their sword and they
 

161
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,130
um about I've taped their sword and they
draw it like this as if they're drawing

162
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,140
draw it like this as if they're drawing
 

163
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,830
draw it like this as if they're drawing
it out in a scaven and and then like

164
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
it out in a scaven and and then like
 

165
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,610
it out in a scaven and and then like
this but look at me I might be correct

166
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
this but look at me I might be correct
 

167
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,589
this but look at me I might be correct
