and people should
you should expect that he's not going to

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
you should expect that he's not going to
 

61
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,030
you should expect that he's not going to

go with the program
 

63
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,789
go with the program
and he's going to push up once you're

64
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
and he's going to push up once you're
 

65
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,950
and he's going to push up once you're
out of kihon laws that you see

66
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
out of kihon laws that you see
 

67
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,469
out of kihon laws that you see
so as as he's pushing up that's what you

68
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
so as as he's pushing up that's what you
 

69
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,670
so as as he's pushing up that's what you
take forward you see it every little if

70
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
take forward you see it every little if
 

71

you slow it down

you slow it down
 

73
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,830
you slow it down
every time he pushes up instead of

74
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
every time he pushes up instead of
 

75
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,789
every time he pushes up instead of
pushing down on it he pushes up you're

76
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
pushing down on it he pushes up you're
 

77
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,190
pushing down on it he pushes up you're
taking it forward you see he pushes up

78
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
taking it forward you see he pushes up
 

79
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,270
taking it forward you see he pushes up
and you're taking it forward and that

80
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
and you're taking it forward and that
 

81
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,830
and you're taking it forward and that
way he's here you don't contest what

82
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
way he's here you don't contest what

174
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
down you see that going down and then
 

175
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,629
down you see that going down and then
you don't want to go

176
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
you don't want to go
 

177
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,150
you don't want to go
okay

178
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
okay
 

179
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,350
okay
so

180
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
so
 

181
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,070
so
as he's not going down that's the energy

182
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

183
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,230

now if you're late like i saw something

184
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
now if you're late like i saw something
 

185
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,070

you're doing
you go here

188
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
you go here
 

189
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,590
you go here
and it goes in a wave

190
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
and it goes in a wave
 

191
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,830
and it goes in a wave
you see

192
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
you see
 

193
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,150
you see
that so just like

194
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
that so just like
 

195
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,230
that so just like
when he's pushing

196
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
when he's pushing
 

197
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,710
when he's pushing
like yesterday his his energy is going

198
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
like yesterday his his energy is going
 

199
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,749
like yesterday his his energy is going
through me so he can't lift my hand okay

200
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
through me so he can't lift my hand okay
 

201
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,629
through me so he can't lift my hand okay
so i'm coming around he goes i wasn't

202
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
so i'm coming around he goes i wasn't
 

203
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,950
so i'm coming around he goes i wasn't
pushing on it do you see and then i go

204
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
pushing on it do you see and then i go
 

205
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,350
pushing on it do you see and then i go
oh yeah push it forward

206
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
oh yeah push it forward
 

207
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,510
oh yeah push it forward
his energy is uh

208
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
his energy is uh
 

209
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,629
his energy is uh
passing through my hand okay

210
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
passing through my hand okay
 

211
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,710
passing through my hand okay
same exact way

212
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
same exact way
 

213
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,870
same exact way
passing through my

214
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
passing through my
 

215
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,909
passing through my
it doesn't flood okay

216
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919

 

217
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,350

221
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:42,550

just keep it moving keep it moving

222
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560

 

223
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,830

keep it moving

224
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840

 

225
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,510

but he's gonna

226
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
but he's gonna
 

227
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,110
but he's gonna

230
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
go go hard boom you got it he goes
 

231
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,629
go go hard boom you got it he goes
that's the energy that i sent back okay

232
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
that's the energy that i sent back okay
 

233
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,870
that's the energy that i sent back okay
if he's not doing anything i can't do

234
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
if he's not doing anything i can't do
 

235
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,830
if he's not doing anything i can't do
that

236
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
that
 

237
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,350
that
got it when he goes high i don't push on

238
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
got it when he goes high i don't push on
 

239
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,309
got it when he goes high i don't push on
this

240
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
this
 

241
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,270
this
it bounces through

242
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280

 

243
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,390

oh it keeps going around

244
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
oh it keeps going around
 

245
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,629
oh it keeps going around
you can't even tell that he's pushing up

246
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
you can't even tell that he's pushing up
 

247
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,240
you can't even tell that he's pushing up
on me do you get it okay
