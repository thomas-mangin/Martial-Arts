so when i was watching uh
danny and sebastian this is what i saw
just a little movement there on their
arm
all right so
i mean i can't obviously see myself but
i'm hoping it's not
doing too much of that
so the next technique is uh everyone's
favorite
pick here the categorical
so this one i'm not so good
a little bit on i'm concentrating now on
sensitivity
rather than the technique
