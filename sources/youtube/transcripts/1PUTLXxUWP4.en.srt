do you eat meat any fun then you go
 

67
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,199
do you eat meat any fun then you go
where there's space then you go where

68
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,209
where there's space then you go where
 

69
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,360
where there's space then you go where
this position is but you have to wait

70
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,370
this position is but you have to wait
 

71
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:22,660
this position is but you have to wait
for her in this very very this is an

72
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:22,670
for her in this very very this is an
 

73
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,789

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,630

so don't just make it a free-for-all

78
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640
so don't just make it a free-for-all
 

79

so katate dori is telling me so he gives

82
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,270
so katate dori is telling me so he gives
 

83
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,050
so katate dori is telling me so he gives
a push all right so that's this is I

84
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,060
a push all right so that's this is I
 

85
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,360
a push all right so that's this is I
can't stay here because this is not

00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
know here this is where I would say I'm
 

91
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,070
know here this is where I would say I'm
going to do something we should tell you

92
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
going to do something we should tell you
 

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
going to do something we should tell you
you must be doing something so as he

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,090
you must be doing something so as he
 

95
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,820
you must be doing something so as he
goes that's that's when i neutralize

96
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:01,830
goes that's that's when i neutralize
 

97
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,160
goes that's that's when i neutralize
that do you see how I'm doing that okay

98
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,170
that do you see how I'm doing that okay
 

99
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,800
that do you see how I'm doing that okay
so I'm looking for this to reach let's

100
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:06,810
so I'm looking for this to reach let's
 

101
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,910
so I'm looking for this to reach let's
call it zero zero is not plus one

102
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
call it zero zero is not plus one
 

103
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,250
call it zero zero is not plus one
pushing or plus one pulling got it right

104
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,260
pushing or plus one pulling got it right
 

105
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,430
pushing or plus one pulling got it right
it hits zero and the same thing if I

106
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,440
it hits zero and the same thing if I
 

107
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,550
it hits zero and the same thing if I
start going here that's gonna be a pull

108
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,560
start going here that's gonna be a pull
 

109
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,280
start going here that's gonna be a pull
do you see that so that's gonna be plus

110
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,290
do you see that so that's gonna be plus
 

111
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,000
do you see that so that's gonna be plus
one pull

112
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,010
one pull
 

113
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,130
one pull
it's gonna I wanted to set to say it's

114
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,140
it's gonna I wanted to set to say it's

it's gonna I wanted to set to say it's
zero so this grip is telling me where I

116
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,470
zero so this grip is telling me where I
 

117
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,020
zero so this grip is telling me where I
need to step at what rate at what angle

118
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,030
need to step at what rate at what angle
 

119
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,780

you got it and the same thing with this

120
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,790
you got it and the same thing with this
 

121
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,259
you got it and the same thing with this
hand if I move this over here you're

122
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:39,269
hand if I move this over here you're
 

123
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,449
hand if I move this over here you're
gonna feel a lot more mass it's not

124
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:41,459
gonna feel a lot more mass it's not
 

125
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,290
gonna feel a lot more mass it's not
hitting at zero so this hand has got to

126
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,300
hitting at zero so this hand has got to
 

127
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,630
hitting at zero so this hand has got to
be at 0 and this hands got to be at zero

128
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
be at 0 and this hands got to be at zero
 

129
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
be at 0 and this hands got to be at zero
and that's where I draw it it's just

130
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,610
and that's where I draw it it's just
 

131
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,150

now is not at zero plus one so I don't

152
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,300
now is not at zero plus one so I don't
 

153
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,659
now is not at zero plus one so I don't
do that same thing here if I'm pushing

00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:26,669
do that same thing here if I'm pushing
 

155
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,030
do that same thing here if I'm pushing
on that that's plus one no rather

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,320
was just to Nikko right that's where I
 

161
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,970
was just to Nikko right that's where I
would end go back but I have to keep the

162
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:38,980
would end go back but I have to keep the
 

163
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,840
would end go back but I have to keep the
zero and find a new pattern so it says

164
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:42,850
zero and find a new pattern so it says
 

165
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:50,700
zero and find a new pattern so it says
zero so he's neutralized zero boom here

166
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:50,710
zero so he's neutralized zero boom here
 

167
00:04:50,710 --> 00:05:00,330
zero so he's neutralized zero boom here
we go zero zero one zero and my grips

168
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,340
we go zero zero one zero and my grips
 

169
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,640
we go zero zero one zero and my grips
are telling me what I need to do and

170
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:02,650
are telling me what I need to do and
 

171
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:15,900
are telling me what I need to do and
when to do it how far to do it okay

172
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:15,910

 

173
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,420

you want do you want something that's

174
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,430
you want do you want something that's
 

175
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,500
you want do you want something that's
the problem

176
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,510

 

177
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,510

so you want him to fall something you go

178
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:24,520
so you want him to fall something you go
 

179
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,830
so you want him to fall something you go
plus push plus one foot you want him not

180
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:28,840
plus push plus one foot you want him not
 

181
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,770
plus push plus one foot you want him not
to be there so you go plus one for you

182
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:31,780
to be there so you go plus one for you
 

183
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,650
to be there so you go plus one for you
you really have to stop having an

184
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:34,660
you really have to stop having an
 

185
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,450
you really have to stop having an
intention and really just have a feeling

186
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:38,460
intention and really just have a feeling
 

187
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,520
intention and really just have a feeling
just a feeling that's all you want

188
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,530
just a feeling that's all you want
 

189
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,550
just a feeling that's all you want
that's all you want so I know he's

190
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
that's all you want so I know he's
 

191
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,800
that's all you want so I know he's
slowing down but I'm not taking him down

192
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:48,810
slowing down but I'm not taking him down
 

193
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,500
slowing down but I'm not taking him down
so as if he pushes I just neutralize

194
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:52,510
so as if he pushes I just neutralize
 

195
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,740
so as if he pushes I just neutralize
right so this this is me taking him down

196
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:55,750
right so this this is me taking him down

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,060
right so this this is me taking him down
