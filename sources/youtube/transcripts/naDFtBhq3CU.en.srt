176
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
and i'm doing this
 

177
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,910
and i'm doing this
pull your arm up

178
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
pull your arm up
 

179
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,509
pull your arm up
pull it wherever you want walk around

180
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
pull it wherever you want walk around
 

181
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:25,189
pull it wherever you want walk around
run around

182
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199

 

183
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,909

so it's two ways of thinking about it

184
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
so it's two ways of thinking about it
 

185
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,629
so it's two ways of thinking about it
there's the fear way

186
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
there's the fear way
 

187
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,629
there's the fear way
trying to overpower someone trying to

188
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
trying to overpower someone trying to
 

189
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,430
trying to overpower someone trying to
make their arm come to you

190
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
make their arm come to you
 

191
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,510
make their arm come to you
and then the other way is keep yourself

192
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
and then the other way is keep yourself
 

193
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,870
and then the other way is keep yourself
on their arm

194
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
on their arm
 

195
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,870
on their arm
you see that so you keep doing this

196
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
you see that so you keep doing this
 

197
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,270
you see that so you keep doing this
which if i'm way stronger than you i

198
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
which if i'm way stronger than you i
 

199
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,749
which if i'm way stronger than you i
could probably do it okay but when

200
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
could probably do it okay but when
 

201
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,830
could probably do it okay but when
fights move take a step

202
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
fights move take a step
 

203
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,590
fights move take a step
and now i don't have the same leverage

204
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
and now i don't have the same leverage
 

205
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,909
and now i don't have the same leverage
right here you see just with that one

206
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
right here you see just with that one
 

207
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,830
right here you see just with that one
step you're gonna drop your elbow this

208
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
step you're gonna drop your elbow this
 

209
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,590
step you're gonna drop your elbow this
way and pull your arm jersey

210
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
way and pull your arm jersey
 

211
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,710
way and pull your arm jersey
okay

212
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
okay
 

213
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,590
okay
so

214
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
so
 

215
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,189
so
even if i start out strong

216
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
even if i start out strong
 

217
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,909
even if i start out strong
administratively fight smooth and you

218
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
administratively fight smooth and you
 

219
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,909
administratively fight smooth and you
lose your leverage and they gain their

220
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
lose your leverage and they gain their
 

221
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,310
lose your leverage and they gain their
leverage so it's never a good tackler

222
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
leverage so it's never a good tackler
 

223
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,469
leverage so it's never a good tackler
and also you're burning energy

224
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
and also you're burning energy
 

225
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,430
and also you're burning energy
so

226
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
so
 

227
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,909
so
not a fear response here

228
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
not a fear response here
 

229
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,110
not a fear response here
uh

230
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120

okay so we don't have to be afraid and
 

297
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,390
okay so we don't have to be afraid and
slammer right away we already have

298
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
slammer right away we already have
 

299
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,469
slammer right away we already have
control so pay attention we go down and

300
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
control so pay attention we go down and
 

301

get her knees to go like that you see
 

303
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,990
get her knees to go like that you see
and now if she tries to fall forward

304
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
and now if she tries to fall forward
 

305
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,990
and now if she tries to fall forward
we have her she can't fall forward you

306

we have her she can't fall forward you
 

307
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,629
we have her she can't fall forward you
see that and so we're lowering her

308
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
see that and so we're lowering her
 

309
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,270
see that and so we're lowering her
lowering her trying to fall forward

lowering her trying to fall forward
 

311
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,510
lowering her trying to fall forward
you think she can't fall forward we're

312
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
you think she can't fall forward we're
 

313
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,270
you think she can't fall forward we're
lowering lowering lowering lowering okay

314
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
lowering lowering lowering lowering okay
 

315
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,710
lowering lowering lowering lowering okay
um so we have a couple choices here

316
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
um so we have a couple choices here
 

317
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,589
um so we have a couple choices here
we can pass this kind of like katakatama

318
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
we can pass this kind of like katakatama
 

319
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,589
we can pass this kind of like katakatama
if we feel there's an opening

320
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
if we feel there's an opening
 

321
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,469
if we feel there's an opening
so

322
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
so
 

323
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,710
so
we're just going to come up

324
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
we're just going to come up
 

325
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,629
we're just going to come up
control the echo

326
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
control the echo
 

327
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,270
control the echo
and thread the knee other way

328
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
and thread the knee other way
 

329
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,309
and thread the knee other way
this way

330
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
this way
 

331
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,749
this way
and then we have this

332
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
and then we have this
 

333
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,070
and then we have this
which we did the other day okay be in

334
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
which we did the other day okay be in
 

335
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,390
which we did the other day okay be in
the arm off the respiratory system

336
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
the arm off the respiratory system
 

337
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,629
the arm off the respiratory system
ground the upward knee so your weight is

338
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
ground the upward knee so your weight is
 

339
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,430
ground the upward knee so your weight is
on the output here okay

340
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
on the output here okay
 

341
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,550
on the output here okay
if there's a third person

342
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560

cuffing
 

533
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,870
cuffing
this way

534
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
this way
 

535
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,750
this way
okay

okay
you're in this position

538
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
you're in this position
 

539
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,150
you're in this position
um so you we did this technique last

540
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160

andrew
hank

554
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
hank
 

555
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,030
hank
we're here like this okay

556
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
we're here like this okay
 

557
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,190
we're here like this okay
and we just handcuffed

558
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200

 

559
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,190

so just like going forward it goes knees

560
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
so just like going forward it goes knees
 

561
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,949
so just like going forward it goes knees
then shoulder

562
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
then shoulder
 

563
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,190
then shoulder
which means you have to actually aim for

564
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
which means you have to actually aim for
 

565
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,590
which means you have to actually aim for
that with your force vectors

566
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
that with your force vectors
 

567
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,829
that with your force vectors
and then two you have to have some

568
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
and then two you have to have some
 

569
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,190
and then two you have to have some
capacity

570
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
capacity
 

571
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,790
capacity
to

572
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
to
 

573
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,069
to
slow hold so he does not hit his head

574
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
slow hold so he does not hit his head
 

575
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,310
slow hold so he does not hit his head
because we have both arms okay

576
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
because we have both arms okay
 

577
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,990
because we have both arms okay
and then lastly

578
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
and then lastly
 

579
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,310
and then lastly
uh be patient because

580
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
uh be patient because
 

581
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,230
uh be patient because
he's not going anywhere because i'm

582
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
he's not going anywhere because i'm
 

583
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,750
he's not going anywhere because i'm
stuck to his arms okay got it so

584
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
stuck to his arms okay got it so
 

585
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,790
stuck to his arms okay got it so
one of the other benefits from this is

586
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
one of the other benefits from this is
 

587
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,470
one of the other benefits from this is
facing the front

588
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
facing the front
 

589
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,310
facing the front
we got here

590
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
we got here
 

591
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,430
we got here
is since there's two officers here

592
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
is since there's two officers here
 

593
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,310
is since there's two officers here
uh we don't have to worry about what's

594
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
uh we don't have to worry about what's
 

595
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,629
uh we don't have to worry about what's
on our waist because he has the other

596
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
on our waist because he has the other
 

597
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,310
on our waist because he has the other
arm and i have this arm so for example

598
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
arm and i have this arm so for example
 

599
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,710
arm and i have this arm so for example
let's say i'm one guy here and i'm

600
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
let's say i'm one guy here and i'm
 

601
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,110
let's say i'm one guy here and i'm
trying to do this move right

602
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
trying to do this move right
 

603
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,590
trying to do this move right
and he tries to go up

604
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
and he tries to go up
 

605
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,670
and he tries to go up
and i do my judicial

606
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
and i do my judicial
 

607
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,629
and i do my judicial
now my taser and what have you is on

608
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
now my taser and what have you is on
 

609
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,590
now my taser and what have you is on
this side i'm exposed to it okay

610
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
this side i'm exposed to it okay
 

611
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,910
this side i'm exposed to it okay
so that's another advantage of two

612
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
so that's another advantage of two
 

613
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,910
so that's another advantage of two
people and what i want you to understand

614

people and what i want you to understand
 

615
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,030
people and what i want you to understand
from that is

616
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
from that is
 

617
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,910
from that is
you can be calm take your time and let

him exhaust himself
 

621
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,030
him exhaust himself
and then do this incrementally move down

622
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
and then do this incrementally move down
 

623
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:53,829
and then do this incrementally move down
okay

624
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839

 

625
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,949

okay

626
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
okay
 

627
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,430
okay
um

and we will be the backup officers
 

633
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,470
and we will be the backup officers
because we're wearing shoes and i don't

you got the arm somehow
 

641
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,590
you got the arm somehow
he's resisting forwards so we're so what

642
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
he's resisting forwards so we're so what
 

643
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,990
he's resisting forwards so we're so what
happens is we want him to go pro

but he he's too strong or whatever or it
could be other environment

648
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
could be other environment
 

649
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,150
could be other environment
so we're going to use the seated

650
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
so we're going to use the seated
 

651
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,470
so we're going to use the seated
position disadvantage you see that to do

652
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
position disadvantage you see that to do
 

653
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,310
position disadvantage you see that to do
the hand pressure okay we're not going

654
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
the hand pressure okay we're not going
 

655
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,310
the hand pressure okay we're not going
to take them back onto this supine

656
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
to take them back onto this supine
 

657
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,910
to take them back onto this supine
position

658
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
position
 

659
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,870
position
okay so uh what i have had happen

660
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
okay so uh what i have had happen
 

661
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,829
okay so uh what i have had happen
is okay we get the initial uh yin

662
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
is okay we get the initial uh yin
 

663
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,110
is okay we get the initial uh yin
opening

opening
 

665
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,910
opening
go and then he regains his posture here

666
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
go and then he regains his posture here
 

667
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,550

strong he's got a good stroller core
 

671
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,350
strong he's got a good stroller core
this is where that exhaustion technique

672
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
this is where that exhaustion technique
 

673
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,829
this is where that exhaustion technique
comes in you're fine okay you can even

674
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
comes in you're fine okay you can even
 

675
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,310
comes in you're fine okay you can even
kind of fake them out by by the way that

676
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
kind of fake them out by by the way that
 

677
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,189
kind of fake them out by by the way that
you would do somebody who's down and

678
