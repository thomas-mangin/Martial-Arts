00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960

 

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:29,669

It's on the head.

4
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679

 

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,549

Probably the most important move

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
Probably the most important move
 

7
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:41,670
Probably the most important move
on the second.

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680

 

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,190

Okay. So, what we're going to be

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
Okay. So, what we're going to be
 

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,110
Okay. So, what we're going to be
concentrating on is uh harmoniz movement

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
concentrating on is uh harmoniz movement
 

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,430
concentrating on is uh harmoniz movement

00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
entire body. Now,

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,510
entire body. Now,
the good thing about

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
the good thing about
 

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,349
the good thing about
I think that differentiates style from

20
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
I think that differentiates style from
 

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,149
I think that differentiates style from
smack off.

22
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
smack off.
 

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,630
smack off.
The thing that different differentiates

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
The thing that different differentiates
 

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,950
The thing that different differentiates
style from other styles or at least

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
style from other styles or at least
 

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,270
style from other styles or at least
they're used to is they utilize

28
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
they're used to is they utilize
 

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,070
they're used to is they utilize
strongholds and that really

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
strongholds and that really
 

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,350
strongholds and that really
uh forces you to harmonize your body

32
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
uh forces you to harmonize your body
 

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,270
uh forces you to harmonize your body
movements. Right. So if he's just

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
movements. Right. So if he's just
 

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,270
movements. Right. So if he's just
blending with me, I can do anything.

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
blending with me, I can do anything.
 

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,870
blending with me, I can do anything.
There's no pressure on me to get things

38
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
There's no pressure on me to get things
 

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,830
There's no pressure on me to get things
right. If if he's holding strong, I just

40
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
right. If if he's holding strong, I just
 

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,749
right. If if he's holding strong, I just
try and

42
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759

 

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,190

if I just try and move anyhow.

44
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
if I just try and move anyhow.
 

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,190
if I just try and move anyhow.
um I can't basically so I need to just

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
um I can't basically so I need to just
 

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,149
um I can't basically so I need to just
move in a unified way

48
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
move in a unified way
 

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,030
move in a unified way
in a very calm way

50
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040

 

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,630

and

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640

 

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,789

this produces

54
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799

 

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,950

it changes how your mind works

56
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960

 

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,749

and then while I do this morator after

58
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
and then while I do this morator after
 

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,790
and then while I do this morator after
that before every lesson and kind of

60
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
that before every lesson and kind of
 

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,270
that before every lesson and kind of
realize it's really important. The other

62
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
realize it's really important. The other
 

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,790
realize it's really important. The other
thing I do is it's a bit more subtle

64
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
thing I do is it's a bit more subtle
 

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,309
thing I do is it's a bit more subtle
is I connect to him here.

66
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319

 

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,470

Okay. So, I'm just I'm kind of extending

68
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
Okay. So, I'm just I'm kind of extending
 

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,430
Okay. So, I'm just I'm kind of extending
it. You can just feel if it's sens.

70
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440

 

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,430

It's not

72
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
It's not
 

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,830
It's not
it's not it's not really hard. It's just

74
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
it's not it's not really hard. It's just
 

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,350
it's not it's not really hard. It's just
enough

76
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
enough
 

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,150
enough
pressure. He's actually pressuring.

78
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
pressure. He's actually pressuring.
 

79
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,750
pressure. He's actually pressuring.
He's pushing side and back like that. So

80
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
He's pushing side and back like that. So
 

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,430
He's pushing side and back like that. So
just using that and he will sort of push

82
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
just using that and he will sort of push
 

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,350
just using that and he will sort of push
against that to some degree.

84
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
against that to some degree.
 

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,150
against that to some degree.
Just do things like it's just a little

86
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
Just do things like it's just a little
 

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,710
Just do things like it's just a little
bit extra. Okay. So just subtly

88
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
bit extra. Okay. So just subtly
 

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,790
bit extra. Okay. So just subtly
try and

90
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
try and
 

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,270
try and
reach into that or even that way makes

92
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
reach into that or even that way makes
 

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,430
reach into that or even that way makes
slightly sense but try to join his

94
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
slightly sense but try to join his
 

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,630
slightly sense but try to join his
center my center if his center joins to

96
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
center my center if his center joins to
 

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,070
center my center if his center joins to
my center

98
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080

 

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:23,030

I have control I'm center I'm

100
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040

 

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,110

So when I do techniques,

102
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
So when I do techniques,
 

103
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,589
So when I do techniques,
I work I kind of work them out as

104
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
I work I kind of work them out as
 

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,229
I work I kind of work them out as
it's not just me, it's him as well.

106
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
it's not just me, it's him as well.
 

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,869
it's not just me, it's him as well.
Yeah. So

108
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
Yeah. So
 

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,750
Yeah. So
we become one

110
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
we become one
 

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,190
we become one
unit, one biomechanical unit.

112
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200

 

113
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,430

So while I'm looking to move his

114
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
So while I'm looking to move his
 

115
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,670
So while I'm looking to move his
structure with my structure so he

116
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
structure with my structure so he
 

117
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
structure with my structure so he
becomes

118
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
becomes
 

119
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,110
becomes
um the extension of me bit like with

120
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
um the extension of me bit like with
 

121
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,550
um the extension of me bit like with
with a sword becomes an extension

122
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
with a sword becomes an extension
 

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,149
with a sword becomes an extension
hopefully

124
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
hopefully
 

125
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,429
hopefully
you kind of doesn't matter if you got

126
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
you kind of doesn't matter if you got
 

127
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,350
you kind of doesn't matter if you got
the sword or you haven't got the sword

128
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
the sword or you haven't got the sword
 

129
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,670
the sword or you haven't got the sword
and it sort of starts to come same with

130
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
and it sort of starts to come same with
 

131
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,470
and it sort of starts to come same with
another person you kind of try. So just

132
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
another person you kind of try. So just
 

133
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,030
another person you kind of try. So just
try that and uh just try and feel this

134
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
try that and uh just try and feel this
 

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,589
try that and uh just try and feel this
connection there. It's just subtle.

136
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
connection there. It's just subtle.
 

137
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,430
connection there. It's just subtle.
Yeah. Sleep reacting to it.

138
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440

 

139
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,830

Yeah.

140
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
Yeah.
 

141
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,590
Yeah.
Now, if I got too much in making fire.

142
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
Now, if I got too much in making fire.
 

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,030
Now, if I got too much in making fire.
So, it's got to be kind of sub.

144
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
So, it's got to be kind of sub.
 

145
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
So, it's got to be kind of sub.
This is what we're going to be looking

146
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
This is what we're going to be looking
 

147
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,030
This is what we're going to be looking
at.

148
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
at.
 

149
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,830
at.
You could be looking at trying to

150
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
You could be looking at trying to
 

151
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,749
You could be looking at trying to
connect

152
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
connect
 

153
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,710
connect
and then use that connection to control

154
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
and then use that connection to control
 

155
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,749
and then use that connection to control
not in a kind of forceful way in way

156
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
not in a kind of forceful way in way
 

157
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:58,950
not in a kind of forceful way in way
that allows you to move.

158
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960

 

159
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,909

Straight down.

160
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
Straight down.
 

161
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,469
Straight down.
So he holds

162
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
So he holds
 

163
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,110
So he holds
And he should have control of me. So I

164
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
And he should have control of me. So I
 

165
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,270
And he should have control of me. So I
can't.

166
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
can't.
 

167
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,390
can't.
Okay.

168
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400

 

169
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,469

So he should

170
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
So he should
 

171
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,390
So he should
so he's not control

172
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
so he's not control
 

173
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,550
so he's not control
but you know he's trying

174
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560

 

175
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,189

much stronger.

176
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
much stronger.
 

177
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,150
much stronger.
Relax. Extend it towards you.

178
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160

 

179
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,590

So while he's doing that, this is

180
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
So while he's doing that, this is
 

181
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,230
So while he's doing that, this is
what I didn't realize about this thing

182
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
what I didn't realize about this thing
 

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,830
what I didn't realize about this thing
for a long time. He's punching here. So

184
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
for a long time. He's punching here. So
 

185
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,909
for a long time. He's punching here. So
this is a really strong exercise to

186
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
this is a really strong exercise to
 

187
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,590
this is a really strong exercise to
build your center. Yeah. All these horns

188
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
build your center. Yeah. All these horns
 

189
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,070
build your center. Yeah. All these horns
we do, they work center. I came across I

190
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
we do, they work center. I came across I
 

191
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,469
we do, they work center. I came across I
came across uh there's a form of

192
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
came across uh there's a form of
 

193
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,150
came across uh there's a form of
bodybuilding where they just use muscle

194
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
bodybuilding where they just use muscle
 

195
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,469
bodybuilding where they just use muscle
tension. Okay. So they basically just

196
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
tension. Okay. So they basically just
 

197
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,950
tension. Okay. So they basically just
tense muscles they build these enormous

198
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
tense muscles they build these enormous
 

199
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,309
tense muscles they build these enormous
muscles without lifting any weight. Now

200
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
muscles without lifting any weight. Now
 

201
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,070
muscles without lifting any weight. Now
if you talk about strength I people

202
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
if you talk about strength I people
 

203
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,670
if you talk about strength I people
don't like it talk about key and stuff

204
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
don't like it talk about key and stuff
 

205
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,350
don't like it talk about key and stuff
but you have to build your core up and

206
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
but you have to build your core up and
 

207
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,230
but you have to build your core up and
your core is a muscle whether you like

208
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
your core is a muscle whether you like
 

209
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,110
your core is a muscle whether you like
it or not. The thing is to build the

210
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
it or not. The thing is to build the
 

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,950
it or not. The thing is to build the
core up that gives you stable center and

212
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
core up that gives you stable center and
 

213
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,150
core up that gives you stable center and
then you use the core

214
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
then you use the core
 

215
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,309
then you use the core
through your tendons through your sk sk

216
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319

And whenever I talk about strength,

236
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
And whenever I talk about strength,
 

237
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,749
And whenever I talk about strength,
always talk about it's not talking it's

00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
always talk about it's not talking it's
 

239
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,830
always talk about it's not talking it's
not strength. It's it's not it's not

00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
not strength. It's it's not it's not
 

241
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,550
not strength. It's it's not it's not
really the right word because it's

242
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
really the right word because it's
 

243
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,589
really the right word because it's
it's not the same thing as

244
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
it's not the same thing as
 

245
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,870
it's not the same thing as
being strong.

246
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
being strong.
 

247
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,629

So he should control my center. So I

248
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
So he should control my center. So I
 

249
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,950
So he should control my center. So I
can't give you. So there's a little

250
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
can't give you. So there's a little
 

251
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,029
can't give you. So there's a little
twist there.

252
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
twist there.
 

253
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,749
twist there.
Yeah. I just

254
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah. I just
 

255
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,469
Yeah. I just
extend into that. Now by doing that he's

256
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
extend into that. Now by doing that he's
 

257
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,150
extend into that. Now by doing that he's
connected to my center. Yeah.

258
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
connected to my center. Yeah.
 

259
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,830
connected to my center. Yeah.
So

260
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
So
 

261
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,550
So
I can pretty much do what I want,

262
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
I can pretty much do what I want,
 

263
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,350
I can pretty much do what I want,
but it doesn't help when you try and do

264
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
but it doesn't help when you try and do
 

265
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,670
but it doesn't help when you try and do
this. You know, the first time you got

266
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
this. You know, the first time you got
 

267
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,390
this. You know, the first time you got
some gorilla sort of

268
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
some gorilla sort of
 

269
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,430
some gorilla sort of
pulling your arm. So

270
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
pulling your arm. So
 

271
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,589
pulling your arm. So
I'm just move that move to the side

272
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
I'm just move that move to the side
 

273
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,749
I'm just move that move to the side
here. And I've done so

274
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
here. And I've done so
 

275
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,790
here. And I've done so
behind you. I'm also leaning on him a

276
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
behind you. I'm also leaning on him a
 

277
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,950
behind you. I'm also leaning on him a
bit. I'm shifting into his space. Yeah.

278
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
bit. I'm shifting into his space. Yeah.
 

279
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,189
bit. I'm shifting into his space. Yeah.
So, he's quite unstable at this point.

280
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
So, he's quite unstable at this point.
 

281
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,710
So, he's quite unstable at this point.
If I try and go through him here, he's

282
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
If I try and go through him here, he's
 

283
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,150
If I try and go through him here, he's
still strong. So, I just go up

284
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160

 

285
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,869

here around this.

286
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879

 

287
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,670

So, it's relax.

288
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680

 

289
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,909

So,

290
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
So,
 

291
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,070
So,
come from

292
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
come from
 

293
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,790
come from
my hip turn

294
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800

 

295
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,790

behind cuz he's quite tall. That's he's

296
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
behind cuz he's quite tall. That's he's
 

297
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,709
behind cuz he's quite tall. That's he's
quite strong here. So I need to

298
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
quite strong here. So I need to
 

299
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,829
quite strong here. So I need to
move into space a little bit. Raise the

300
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
move into space a little bit. Raise the
 

301
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,409
move into space a little bit. Raise the
sword

302

again doing this way.

something doesn't work you know like
 

311
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,269
something doesn't work you know like
it's not strong movement. I won't be

312
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
it's not strong movement. I won't be
 

313
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,030
it's not strong movement. I won't be
able to move it. You'll be too strong.

314
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
able to move it. You'll be too strong.
 

315
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,829
able to move it. You'll be too strong.
He's got two arms against me. Yeah. So,

316
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
He's got two arms against me. Yeah. So,
 

317
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,710
He's got two arms against me. Yeah. So,
I just need some

325
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,509
This is hard exercise to understand, but
it's it's kind of essential one. It's

00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
it's it's kind of essential one. It's

it's it's kind of essential one. It's

you don't get this

you don't get this

don't get build up. So you can kind of

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,150
don't get build up. So you can kind of
