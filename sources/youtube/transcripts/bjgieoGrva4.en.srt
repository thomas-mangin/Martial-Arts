179
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,389
this okay
and you add the surface to it so now I

180
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
and you add the surface to it so now I
 

181
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,069
and you add the surface to it so now I
have my head on his shoulder by shoulder

182
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:37,079
have my head on his shoulder by shoulder
 

183
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,430
have my head on his shoulder by shoulder
on his

184
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,440
on his
 

185
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,190
on his
tricep and I add the upper arm it's

186
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,200
tricep and I add the upper arm it's
 

187
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,110
tricep and I add the upper arm it's
across his chest it's on the side of his

188
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
across his chest it's on the side of his
 

189
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,829
across his chest it's on the side of his
neck and all that is moving him this

190
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:50,839
neck and all that is moving him this
 

191
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,030
neck and all that is moving him this
way which is the adhesion so I'm not

192
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,040
way which is the adhesion so I'm not
 

193
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,110
way which is the adhesion so I'm not
going to tighten it I'm not trying to do

194
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,120
going to tighten it I'm not trying to do
 

195
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,949
going to tighten it I'm not trying to do
a coted I just make contact

196
00:09:59,949 --> 00:09:59,959
a coted I just make contact
 

197
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,509
a coted I just make contact
and this will

198
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:04,519

 

199
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,150

adhere so with that

200
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,160

 

201
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,990

adhesion I

202
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
adhesion I
 

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,750
adhesion I
bring him this way this way so that's

204
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
bring him this way this way so that's
 

205
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,509
bring him this way this way so that's
what's happening on the upper

206
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
what's happening on the upper
 

207
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,790
what's happening on the upper
body I'll take it

208
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
body I'll take it
 

209
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,150
body I'll take it
off on the EDI which is the X

210
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
off on the EDI which is the X
 

211
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,790
off on the EDI which is the X
PN you're going to have

212
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
PN you're going to have
 

213
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,550
PN you're going to have
contact on the rib cage

214
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
contact on the rib cage
 

215
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,949
contact on the rib cage
and the

216
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:31,959
and the
 

217
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,750
and the
hip and so I'll take off the upper body

218
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
hip and so I'll take off the upper body
 

219
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:46,030
hip and so I'll take off the upper body
and I adhere there and you move

220
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,040

 

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,509

him okay so that is all

222
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519

 

223
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,310

happening in the technique so as I come

224
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,320
happening in the technique so as I come
 

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,750
happening in the technique so as I come
around and I start to move him this

226
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:00,760
around and I start to move him this
 

227
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,790
around and I start to move him this
way and I start to assist that movement

228
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
way and I start to assist that movement
 

229
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,350
way and I start to assist that movement
with my lower

230
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:08,360

 

231
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,190

body he will

232
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
body he will
 

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,269
body he will
tilt so he's here like that and I tilt

234
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
tilt so he's here like that and I tilt
 

235
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,470
tilt so he's here like that and I tilt
him and then I do

236
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:21,480
him and then I do
 

237
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,350
him and then I do
this his foot will come up and his head

238
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,360
this his foot will come up and his head
 

239
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,350
this his foot will come up and his head
will go

240
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
will go
 

241
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,430
will go
down okay

242
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440

 

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,230

here that's all you need you come in you

244
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,240
here that's all you need you come in you
 

245
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,310
here that's all you need you come in you
make contact you want the contact you

246
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
make contact you want the contact you
 

247
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,870
make contact you want the contact you
keep entering across that tilt I'm not

248
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880
keep entering across that tilt I'm not
 

249
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,910
keep entering across that tilt I'm not
going to do it on him but you keep

250
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
going to do it on him but you keep
 

251
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,910
going to do it on him but you keep
entering across that tilt I'm going to

252
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
entering across that tilt I'm going to
 

253
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,949
entering across that tilt I'm going to
look at this hip now in the x pattern

254
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
look at this hip now in the x pattern
 

255
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,389
look at this hip now in the x pattern
but we know I'm

256
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
but we know I'm
 

257
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,750
but we know I'm
rotating okay as we

258
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
rotating okay as we
 

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,550
rotating okay as we
rotate it'll load this kosi and that is

260
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
rotate it'll load this kosi and that is
 

261
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,870
rotate it'll load this kosi and that is
the ex

262
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:01,880

 

263
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,110

padon going this

264
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120

 

265
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,069

way I'm

266
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:11,079
way I'm
 

267
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:18,150
way I'm
here and I'm hitting

268
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160

 

269
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,030

here so you're bringing him

270
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
here so you're bringing him
 

271
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,750
here so you're bringing him
around which she's going to

272
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
around which she's going to
 

273
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,150
around which she's going to
tilt then there's a

274
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
tilt then there's a
 

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,550
tilt then there's a
fulcrum and then there's an obstruction

276
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
fulcrum and then there's an obstruction
 

277
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,310
fulcrum and then there's an obstruction
to his abil AB ility to step back

278
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
to his abil AB ility to step back
 

279
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,990
to his abil AB ility to step back
underneath him okay that is the

280
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,000
underneath him okay that is the
 

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,310
underneath him okay that is the
technique so without the throw

282
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320

 

283
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,030

but kind of the throw okay you don't

284
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
but kind of the throw okay you don't
 

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,069
but kind of the throw okay you don't
don't try

286
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:51,079

 

287
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,189

to B him that's just that's how

288
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:54,199
to B him that's just that's how
 

289
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,959
to B him that's just that's how
my teacher did it too but it's not right
