work all right let's talk about the
 

23
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,589
work all right let's talk about the
second form as I teach it this is very

24
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
second form as I teach it this is very
 

25
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,190
second form as I teach it this is very
similar to the ninth form of cyto iwama

26
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
similar to the ninth form of cyto iwama
 

27
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,590
similar to the ninth form of cyto iwama
system if you're following along in that

28
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
system if you're following along in that
 

29
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,110
system if you're following along in that
um a few things are changed um and it's

30
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
um a few things are changed um and it's
 

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,270
um a few things are changed um and it's
a little bit different but basically the

32
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
a little bit different but basically the
 

33
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,389
a little bit different but basically the
same idea okay in this just like the

34
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
same idea okay in this just like the
 

35
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,709
same idea okay in this just like the
first form let's go ahead and switch

36
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:47,719
first form let's go ahead and switch
 

37
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,549
first form let's go ahead and switch
directions actually here okay just like

38
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,559
directions actually here okay just like
 

39
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,750
directions actually here okay just like
the first form which is scy the's eth

40
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
the first form which is scy the's eth
 

41
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,709
the first form which is scy the's eth
form we're both in ski but in this form

42
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
form we're both in ski but in this form
 

43
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,229
form we're both in ski but in this form
we're in range so the first form we're

44
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:57,239
we're in range so the first form we're
 

45
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,430
we're in range so the first form we're
out of range this form we're in range

46
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
out of range this form we're in range
 

47
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,910
out of range this form we're in range
and the she the person who's going to

48
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:00,920
and the she the person who's going to
 

49
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,670
and the she the person who's going to
win the form is open now when Josh comes

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
win the form is open now when Josh comes
 

51
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,789
win the form is open now when Josh comes
into ski all I'm going to do is step

52
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
into ski all I'm going to do is step
 

53
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,350
into ski all I'm going to do is step
back and I'm going to use this uh uh

54
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
back and I'm going to use this uh uh
 

55
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,149
back and I'm going to use this uh uh
Masashi barai so that circular actions

56
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
Masashi barai so that circular actions
 

57
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,990
Masashi barai so that circular actions
of mhi bar and then bang I'm right back

58
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,000
of mhi bar and then bang I'm right back
 

59
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,830
of mhi bar and then bang I'm right back
on line so I knocked him off and we're

60
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:14,840
on line so I knocked him off and we're
 

61
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,670
on line so I knocked him off and we're
online so actually we just switched

62
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
online so actually we just switched
 

63
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,070
online so actually we just switched
positions here right so Josh is now in

64
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
positions here right so Josh is now in
 

65
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,910
positions here right so Josh is now in
the opposite side of what I was so if

66
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:20,920
the opposite side of what I was so if
 

67
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,109
the opposite side of what I was so if
we're looking at this as a form which it

68
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
we're looking at this as a form which it
 

69
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,069
we're looking at this as a form which it
is we can start to realize that these

70
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:25,079
is we can start to realize that these
 

71
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,710
is we can start to realize that these
are two different ideas from the same

72
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
are two different ideas from the same
 

73
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,550
are two different ideas from the same
position so in one form we're learning

74
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
position so in one form we're learning
 

75
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,510
position so in one form we're learning
two ideas from the same position okay

76
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,520
two ideas from the same position okay
 

77
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,950
two ideas from the same position okay
now what Josh could do here is go into

78
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:31,960
now what Josh could do here is go into
 

79
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,190
now what Josh could do here is go into
jodan guch and he can do it in such a

80
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
jodan guch and he can do it in such a
 

81
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,550
jodan guch and he can do it in such a
way that when he hits me I can't return

82
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
way that when he hits me I can't return
 

83
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,350
way that when he hits me I can't return
shot on him right so that's one of the

84
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
shot on him right so that's one of the
 

85
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,870
shot on him right so that's one of the
things that I think is highlighted in

86
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
things that I think is highlighted in
 

87
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,910
things that I think is highlighted in
all of these Kum Joe is that uh we can

88
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
all of these Kum Joe is that uh we can
 

89
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,149
all of these Kum Joe is that uh we can
transition our our ski Kamai into a kin

90
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
transition our our ski Kamai into a kin
 

91
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,270
transition our our ski Kamai into a kin
Kamai or a kin Kamai into ski Kamai Etc

92
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
Kamai or a kin Kamai into ski Kamai Etc
 

93
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,950
Kamai or a kin Kamai into ski Kamai Etc
as we go right so what's basically

94
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
as we go right so what's basically
 

95
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,389
as we go right so what's basically
happening in this is we're at range Josh

96
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
happening in this is we're at range Josh
 

97
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,670
happening in this is we're at range Josh
comes in I try to make distance and Josh

98
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:54,680
comes in I try to make distance and Josh
 

99
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,630
comes in I try to make distance and Josh
immediately turns that in over and he

100
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
immediately turns that in over and he
 

101
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,630
immediately turns that in over and he
goes into this okay now what's nice

102
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
goes into this okay now what's nice
 

103
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,270
goes into this okay now what's nice
about that jodon gu huge is it could be

104
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
about that jodon gu huge is it could be
 

105
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,230
about that jodon gu huge is it could be
if I was receding or if I'm pushing

106
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
if I was receding or if I'm pushing
 

107
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,550
if I was receding or if I'm pushing
right so meaning if I receded really far

108
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,560
right so meaning if I receded really far
 

109
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,350
right so meaning if I receded really far
okay Josh can cover that distance and

110
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
okay Josh can cover that distance and
 

111
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,390
okay Josh can cover that distance and
hit me with the jodan guch right whereas

112
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
hit me with the jodan guch right whereas
 

113
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,229
hit me with the jodan guch right whereas
if Josh threw another ski and I receded

114
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,239
if Josh threw another ski and I receded
 

115
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,030
if Josh threw another ski and I receded
really far he'll miss me right so that

116
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
really far he'll miss me right so that
 

117
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,869
really far he'll miss me right so that
jodan guch allows him to account for

118
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
jodan guch allows him to account for
 

119
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,630
jodan guch allows him to account for
distance also if I were to push into

120
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
distance also if I were to push into
 

121
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,030
distance also if I were to push into
Josh after this so I go here and I push

122
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
Josh after this so I go here and I push
 

123
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,270
Josh after this so I go here and I push
in Josh can pull himself back and still

124
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
in Josh can pull himself back and still
 

125
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,830
in Josh can pull himself back and still
hit me so that's a really important

126
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
hit me so that's a really important
 

127
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,030
hit me so that's a really important
aspect of this going into the kin my

128
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,040
aspect of this going into the kin my
 

129
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,150
aspect of this going into the kin my
situation is that he's longer than I am

130
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
situation is that he's longer than I am
 

131
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,910
situation is that he's longer than I am
and so he can use that to his Advantage

132
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
and so he can use that to his Advantage
 

133
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,830
and so he can use that to his Advantage
whether I'm pushing at him or receding

134
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
whether I'm pushing at him or receding
 

135
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,430
whether I'm pushing at him or receding
away from him okay now in that situation

136
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
away from him okay now in that situation
 

137
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,309
away from him okay now in that situation
I have to somehow cover the distance of

138
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
I have to somehow cover the distance of
 

139
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,509
I have to somehow cover the distance of
him doing that right so meaning when I

140
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,519
him doing that right so meaning when I
 

141
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,070
him doing that right so meaning when I
do this I have to cover this distance

142
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,080
do this I have to cover this distance
 

143
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,430
do this I have to cover this distance
somehow so what I'm going to do is a

144
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
somehow so what I'm going to do is a
 

145
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,030
somehow so what I'm going to do is a
really clever way I'm going to come uh

146
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
really clever way I'm going to come uh
 

147
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,830
really clever way I'm going to come uh
Uchi a which is a rising strike I'm

148
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
Uchi a which is a rising strike I'm
 

149
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,149
Uchi a which is a rising strike I'm
going to come right up underneath and

150
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,159
going to come right up underneath and
 

151
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,589
going to come right up underneath and
clip him right under the chin here is

152
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,599
clip him right under the chin here is
 

153
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,550
clip him right under the chin here is
what I'm looking for now this is great

154
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
what I'm looking for now this is great
 

155
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,869
what I'm looking for now this is great
because from this situation I've already

156
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
because from this situation I've already
 

157
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,030
because from this situation I've already
gone into an essent ban noai right so

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
gone into an essent ban noai right so
 

159
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,190
gone into an essent ban noai right so
meaning if Josh was real quick and he

160
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
meaning if Josh was real quick and he
 

161
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,270
meaning if Josh was real quick and he
kept striking I could still defend

162
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,280
kept striking I could still defend
 

163
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,470
kept striking I could still defend
myself against whatever he shoots but if

164
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
myself against whatever he shoots but if
 

165
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,550
myself against whatever he shoots but if
I'm in time with him I can come right up

166
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm in time with him I can come right up
 

167
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,229
I'm in time with him I can come right up
underneath and hit him now if he comes

168
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
underneath and hit him now if he comes
 

169
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,149
underneath and hit him now if he comes
in to hit me after this it doesn't

170
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
in to hit me after this it doesn't
 

171
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,270
in to hit me after this it doesn't
matter because I'm in Boni no Kamai

172
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
matter because I'm in Boni no Kamai
 

173
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,229
matter because I'm in Boni no Kamai
right so once I get into this position I

174
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
right so once I get into this position I
 

175
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,110
right so once I get into this position I
can universally block basically anything

176
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
can universally block basically anything
 

177
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,030
can universally block basically anything
he throws from a ski to any kind of

178
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
he throws from a ski to any kind of
 

179
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,710
he throws from a ski to any kind of
overhead strike low strikes doesn't

180
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:21,720
overhead strike low strikes doesn't
 

181
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,869
overhead strike low strikes doesn't
matter I can block it from this position

182
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
matter I can block it from this position
 

183
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,830
matter I can block it from this position
so by coming and clipping him in this

184
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
so by coming and clipping him in this
 

185
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,309
so by coming and clipping him in this
way I've got a real advantage in

186
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
way I've got a real advantage in
 

187
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,509
way I've got a real advantage in
defending myself after that right okay

188
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:30,519
defending myself after that right okay
 

189
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,509
defending myself after that right okay
so we're here I hop back I cover the

190
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
so we're here I hop back I cover the
 

191
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,869
so we're here I hop back I cover the
distance whatever it is and I come up

192
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
distance whatever it is and I come up
 

193
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,270
distance whatever it is and I come up
and I get him here okay now from this

194
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
and I get him here okay now from this
 

195
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,429
and I get him here okay now from this
position he's probably going to try to

196
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:39,439
position he's probably going to try to
 

197
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,390
position he's probably going to try to
come around and hit me low so that's

198
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
come around and hit me low so that's
 

199
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,270
come around and hit me low so that's
what he's looking for and of course I

200
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
what he's looking for and of course I
 

201
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,990
what he's looking for and of course I
could just defend it bang but now I

202
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
could just defend it bang but now I
 

203
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,990
could just defend it bang but now I
haven't gotten any kind of Advantage so

204
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
haven't gotten any kind of Advantage so
 

205
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,110
haven't gotten any kind of Advantage so
instead of that what I'm going to do is

206
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
instead of that what I'm going to do is
 

207
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,710
instead of that what I'm going to do is
slide from here to in between his elbows

208
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
slide from here to in between his elbows
 

209
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,390
slide from here to in between his elbows
and as Josh comes for me I'm just going

210
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
and as Josh comes for me I'm just going
 

211
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,670
and as Josh comes for me I'm just going
to step with him and he gets all bound

212
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:54,680
to step with him and he gets all bound
 

213
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,110
to step with him and he gets all bound
up and he's in a bad way right and that

214
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
up and he's in a bad way right and that
 

215
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,509
up and he's in a bad way right and that
gives me lots of opportunity to continue

216
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
gives me lots of opportunity to continue
 

217
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,949
gives me lots of opportunity to continue
to go with him right actually let's go

218
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
to go with him right actually let's go
 

219
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,910
to go with him right actually let's go
ahead and shoot it from the the other

220
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
ahead and shoot it from the the other
 

221
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,270
ahead and shoot it from the the other
side this time all right so I'm here

222
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
side this time all right so I'm here
 

223
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,069
side this time all right so I'm here
like this Josh comes in after me I step

224
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,079
like this Josh comes in after me I step
 

225
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,390
like this Josh comes in after me I step
back to fend as he raises up I come

226
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
back to fend as he raises up I come
 

227
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,670
back to fend as he raises up I come
underneath and I clip I shoot through

228
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
underneath and I clip I shoot through
 

229
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,710
underneath and I clip I shoot through
his arms and as he comes in I get this

230
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:09,720
his arms and as he comes in I get this
 

231
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,390
his arms and as he comes in I get this
really nice position here coming off to

232
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:11,400
really nice position here coming off to
 

233
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,750
really nice position here coming off to
the side so this is teaching me a way at

234
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
the side so this is teaching me a way at
 

235
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,390
the side so this is teaching me a way at
close range to bind up Josh's arms as we

236
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
close range to bind up Josh's arms as we
 

237
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,830
close range to bind up Josh's arms as we
look at the series of my progression

238
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:18,840
look at the series of my progression
 

239
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,310
look at the series of my progression
here we're going to see lots of ways to

240
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
here we're going to see lots of ways to
 

241
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,949
here we're going to see lots of ways to
deal with binding up their arms which is

242
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:21,959
deal with binding up their arms which is
 

243
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,189
deal with binding up their arms which is
going to be useful in close quarter

244
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
going to be useful in close quarter
 

245
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,189
going to be useful in close quarter
situations which is what we might find

246
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
situations which is what we might find
 

247
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,230
situations which is what we might find
ourselves in if we were using skii

248
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,240
ourselves in if we were using skii
 

249
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,909
ourselves in if we were using skii
versus kenami I.E kenami is a better

250
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
versus kenami I.E kenami is a better
 

251
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,710
versus kenami I.E kenami is a better
Kamai for equalized weapons because it's

252
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
Kamai for equalized weapons because it's
 

253
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,469
Kamai for equalized weapons because it's
going to give him maximum reach and

254
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
going to give him maximum reach and
 

255
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,629
going to give him maximum reach and
power but if I get caught in a

256
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
power but if I get caught in a
 

257
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,270
power but if I get caught in a
close-range situation I might have to go

258
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,280
close-range situation I might have to go
 

259
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,469
close-range situation I might have to go
to ski Kamai and so if I do that how can

260
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
to ski Kamai and so if I do that how can
 

261
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,110
to ski Kamai and so if I do that how can
I bind up this guy's arms to keep him

262
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,120
I bind up this guy's arms to keep him
 

263
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,590
I bind up this guy's arms to keep him
from from getting me so we're going to

264
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
from from getting me so we're going to
 

265
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,710
from from getting me so we're going to
see a lot of those here in this

266
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
see a lot of those here in this
 

267
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,510
see a lot of those here in this
beginning so one more time this form is

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
beginning so one more time this form is
 

269
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,830

we in distance here Josh comes in I try

270
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
we in distance here Josh comes in I try
 

271
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,350
we in distance here Josh comes in I try
to hop out Josh extends I come up

272
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
to hop out Josh extends I come up
 

273
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,590
to hop out Josh extends I come up
underneath I shoot through his arms and

274
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,600
underneath I shoot through his arms and
 

275
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,510
underneath I shoot through his arms and
as he goes to get me all I do is Step

276
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
as he goes to get me all I do is Step
 

277
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,270
as he goes to get me all I do is Step
beside him and throw him that can be a

278
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,280
beside him and throw him that can be a
 

279
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,710
beside him and throw him that can be a
really difficult part I will teach that

280
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
really difficult part I will teach that
 

281
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,629
really difficult part I will teach that
uh throw or control in a separate video

282
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
uh throw or control in a separate video
 

283
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,029
uh throw or control in a separate video
because I could really talk for about 15

more minutes about it so we'll put that

286
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
more minutes about it so we'll put that
 

287
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,390
more minutes about it so we'll put that
in a separate video for you guys but
