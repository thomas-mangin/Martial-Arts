one leg and the cross lateral arm and
 

125
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,070
one leg and the cross lateral arm and
you'll roll at an angle you will not

126
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
you'll roll at an angle you will not
 

127
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,949
you'll roll at an angle you will not
roll straight this way okay okay and

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
the drill does not matter so we use this
 

135
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,270
the drill does not matter so we use this
to let people get comfortable without

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280
to let people get comfortable without
 

137
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,070
to let people get comfortable without
putting that knee on the

138
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
putting that knee on the
 

139
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,949
putting that knee on the
mat so as soon as I pick up my leg the

140
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:15,959
mat so as soon as I pick up my leg the
 

141
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,149
mat so as soon as I pick up my leg the
cross Lowel arm will reach

142
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:19,159
cross Lowel arm will reach
 

143
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,190
cross Lowel arm will reach
over and I

144
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
over and I
 

145
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,670
over and I
roll with that straight back and if I

146
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:24,680
roll with that straight back and if I
 

147
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,149
roll with that straight back and if I
roll at that angle

148
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,159

 

149
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,270

my hips and shoulders are never of the

150
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
my hips and shoulders are never of the
 

151
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:47,110
my hips and shoulders are never of the
same vertical

152
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120

 

153
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:58,710

plane all right let's try

154
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720

 

155
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:47,390

it e

156
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400

 

157
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,749

so at this point you'll have people that

158
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
so at this point you'll have people that
 

159
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,310
so at this point you'll have people that
still want to touch the circle on the

160
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,320
still want to touch the circle on the
 

161
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,909
still want to touch the circle on the
the mat on the positive side of the

162
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:54,919
the mat on the positive side of the
 

163
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,230
the mat on the positive side of the
circle and I just filmed some clips

164
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
circle and I just filmed some clips
 

165
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,430
circle and I just filmed some clips
showing you different degrees of that

166
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
showing you different degrees of that
 

167
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,710
showing you different degrees of that
um so you can do this drill we'll call

168
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:03,720
um so you can do this drill we'll call
 

169
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,950
um so you can do this drill we'll call
it 6.1 where you're going to hit the

170
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
it 6.1 where you're going to hit the
 

171
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,790
it 6.1 where you're going to hit the
mat uh on the negative side of the

172
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:09,800
mat uh on the negative side of the
 

173
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:19,950
mat uh on the negative side of the
circle

174
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:19,960

 

175
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,070

okay SL slapping the mat in this fashion

176
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,080
okay SL slapping the mat in this fashion
 

177
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,390
okay SL slapping the mat in this fashion
makes it impossible to slide it forward

178
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,400
makes it impossible to slide it forward
 

179
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,870
makes it impossible to slide it forward
and touch the mat on the positive side

180
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
and touch the mat on the positive side
 

181
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,029
and touch the mat on the positive side
of the circle so slapping the mat calm

182
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,039
of the circle so slapping the mat calm
 

183
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,590
of the circle so slapping the mat calm
down is closer to what we're going to

184
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
down is closer to what we're going to
 

185
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,590
down is closer to what we're going to
end up with and you make people do it

186
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
end up with and you make people do it
 

187
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,150
end up with and you make people do it
this way in this drill 6.1 go for

188
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160

 

189
00:05:44,160 --> 00:06:00,909

it all right let's try it

190
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:00,919

 

191
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,950

all right the next drill we'll do from

192
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:03,960
all right the next drill we'll do from
 

193
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,629
all right the next drill we'll do from
Kam uh which again because you're going

194
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
Kam uh which again because you're going
 

195
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,790
Kam uh which again because you're going
to go on one leg

196
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,800
to go on one leg
 

197
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,070
to go on one leg
um it doesn't really matter how you

198
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
um it doesn't really matter how you
 

199
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,029
um it doesn't really matter how you
start you could start here and step out

200
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
start you could start here and step out
 

201
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,710
start you could start here and step out
you could just pick your leg up does not

202
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
you could just pick your leg up does not
 

203
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,790
you could just pick your leg up does not
matter how you start but what I have

204
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
matter how you start but what I have
 

205
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,029
matter how you start but what I have
found is that most beginners are nervous

206
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
found is that most beginners are nervous
 

207
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,189
found is that most beginners are nervous
about falling from what they perceived

208
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
about falling from what they perceived
 

209
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,350
about falling from what they perceived
up higher and so just by putting this

210
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,360
up higher and so just by putting this
 

211
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,110
up higher and so just by putting this
leg in the back and I'm going to allow

212
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
leg in the back and I'm going to allow
 

213
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,430
leg in the back and I'm going to allow
them to crawl out into that last stance

214
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
them to crawl out into that last stance
 

215
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,909
them to crawl out into that last stance
okay it's basically the last stance it's

216
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
okay it's basically the last stance it's
 

217
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,749
okay it's basically the last stance it's
just already started because the other

218
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
just already started because the other
 

219
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,510
just already started because the other
leg is not on the

220
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:40,520
leg is not on the
 

221
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,950
leg is not on the
mat and they can get as low as they want

222
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:43,960
mat and they can get as low as they want
 

223
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,790
mat and they can get as low as they want
as long as the mat the knee is not

224
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:45,800
as long as the mat the knee is not
 

225
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:56,900
as long as the mat the knee is not
touching the mat same thing

226
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:56,910

 

227
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:07,029

[Music]

228
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039

 

229
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,110

all right let's

230
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
all right let's
 

231
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,029
all right let's
try okay this is drill 7.1 and you can

232
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
try okay this is drill 7.1 and you can
 

233
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,189
try okay this is drill 7.1 and you can
do the same thing where you make them

234
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
do the same thing where you make them
 

235
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,990
do the same thing where you make them
hit the mat because it's impossible to

236
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
hit the mat because it's impossible to
 

237
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,350
hit the mat because it's impossible to
hit the mat and be on the positive side

238
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
hit the mat and be on the positive side
 

239
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,950
hit the mat and be on the positive side
of the circle and we don't want that

240
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:23,960
of the circle and we don't want that
 

241
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:47,830
of the circle and we don't want that
okay so it'll look something like this

242
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840

 

243
00:07:47,840 --> 00:08:17,589

all right let's try it

244
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599

 

245
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,629

all right so drill uh seven is that let

246
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
all right so drill uh seven is that let
 

247
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,270
all right so drill uh seven is that let
people hang out there as long as they

248
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,280
people hang out there as long as they
 

249
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,670
people hang out there as long as they
needed to be

250
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
needed to be
 

251
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,909
needed to be
comfortable uh that's where a lot of the

252
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
comfortable uh that's where a lot of the
 

253
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,149
comfortable uh that's where a lot of the
fear of heights starts to come in the

254
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159
fear of heights starts to come in the
 

255
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,990
fear of heights starts to come in the
fear of falling

256
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
fear of falling
 

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,230
fear of falling
and uh they will not do

258
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
and uh they will not do
 

259
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,310
and uh they will not do
this body posture okay so you let them

260
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
this body posture okay so you let them
 

261
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,190
this body posture okay so you let them
hang out there there's a downside though

262
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,200
hang out there there's a downside though
 

263
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,110
hang out there there's a downside though
to drill six and seven uh and we had the

264
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
to drill six and seven uh and we had the
 

265
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,469
to drill six and seven uh and we had the
same downside in the small forward roll

266
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:43,479
same downside in the small forward roll
 

267
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,790
same downside in the small forward roll
and that is that to touch the mat to

268
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:45,800
and that is that to touch the mat to
 

269
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,070
and that is that to touch the mat to
have the security of touching the mat

270
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
have the security of touching the mat
 

271
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,590
have the security of touching the mat
you have to close off the chest and uh

272
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
you have to close off the chest and uh
 

273
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,509
you have to close off the chest and uh
it's this shoulder coming towards the

274
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
it's this shoulder coming towards the
 

275
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,110
it's this shoulder coming towards the
that is fighting the what's happening to

276
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,120
that is fighting the what's happening to
 

277
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,829
that is fighting the what's happening to
your body okay so if we look at happens

278
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
your body okay so if we look at happens
 

279
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,630
your body okay so if we look at happens
to the body

280
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,640
to the body
 

281
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,190
to the body
naturally uh if he goes into this

282
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
naturally uh if he goes into this
 

283
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,590
naturally uh if he goes into this
Warrior post here and he just hangs out

284
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:08,600
Warrior post here and he just hangs out
 

285
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,269
Warrior post here and he just hangs out
eventually uh his leg will swing out to

286
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
eventually uh his leg will swing out to
 

287
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,150
eventually uh his leg will swing out to
the outside everyone can do this

288
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
the outside everyone can do this
 

289
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,269
the outside everyone can do this
experiment on their own and go ahead

290
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:16,279
experiment on their own and go ahead
 

291
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,509
experiment on their own and go ahead
just use I'm going to let go using me

292
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:18,519
just use I'm going to let go using me
 

293
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,670
just use I'm going to let go using me
for balance in the meantime okay and

294
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:20,680
for balance in the meantime okay and
 

295
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,630
for balance in the meantime okay and
you'll see that the legs will want to

296
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
you'll see that the legs will want to
 

297
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,870
you'll see that the legs will want to
swing out eventually all on its own

298
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
swing out eventually all on its own
 

299
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,230
swing out eventually all on its own
don't touch the M okay it wants to swing

300
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
don't touch the M okay it wants to swing
 

301
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,470
don't touch the M okay it wants to swing
out and that's what we actually using uh

302
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,480
out and that's what we actually using uh
 

303
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,670
out and that's what we actually using uh
because as that leg swings as that leg

304
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
because as that leg swings as that leg
 

305
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,509
because as that leg swings as that leg
swings out his ability to keep his head

306
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:36,519
swings out his ability to keep his head
 

307
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,110
swings out his ability to keep his head
up is is reduced on any on anyone okay

308
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
up is is reduced on any on anyone okay
 

309
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,470
up is is reduced on any on anyone okay
and this is that effect that I posted on

310
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,480
and this is that effect that I posted on
 

311
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,110
and this is that effect that I posted on
the on one of the videos right that the

312
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,120
the on one of the videos right that the
 

313
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,710
the on one of the videos right that the
posture of this right angle this

314
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
posture of this right angle this
 

315
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,870
posture of this right angle this
three-legged right angle uh destabilizes

316
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:51,880
three-legged right angle uh destabilizes
 

317
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,430
three-legged right angle uh destabilizes
so much and the L flips toxy turby and

318
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
so much and the L flips toxy turby and
 

319
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,630
so much and the L flips toxy turby and
inside out okay and that's what we use

320
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:57,640
inside out okay and that's what we use
 

321
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,470
inside out okay and that's what we use
in our throwing geometry uh but as we

322
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
in our throwing geometry uh but as we
 

323
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,990
in our throwing geometry uh but as we
watch him do that and you now look at

324
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
watch him do that and you now look at
 

325
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,350
watch him do that and you now look at
his chest the shoulder is up the

326
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
his chest the shoulder is up the
 

327
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,550
his chest the shoulder is up the

you still have to touch the mat uh on
 

349
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,470
you still have to touch the mat uh on
the negative side of the circle so I'm

350
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,480
the negative side of the circle so I'm
 

351
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:56,870
the negative side of the circle so I'm
coming

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:40,760
of the Fear Factor you're going to see
 

359
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,430
of the Fear Factor you're going to see
people

360
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:42,440
people
 

361
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,069

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:47,560
head and the foot and they're down here
 

365
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,910
head and the foot and they're down here
like this and even in the last drill as

366
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
like this and even in the last drill as
 

367
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,389
like this and even in the last drill as
I went

368
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:53,399
I went
 

369
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,030
I went
out I came out my foot has to come

370
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,040
out I came out my foot has to come
 

371
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,670

up that that is part of this drill so

372
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,680
up that that is part of this drill so
 

373
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,910
up that that is part of this drill so
I'm not going to be here and then roll

374
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm not going to be here and then roll
 

375
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,230
I'm not going to be here and then roll
as my head goes down my foot comes

376
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
as my head goes down my foot comes
 

377
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,430
as my head goes down my foot comes
up my foot lifting lowers my head this

378

motion so as they moving forward it'll
 

579
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,070
motion so as they moving forward it'll
be taken right into the roll and this

580

be taken right into the roll and this
 

581
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,830
be taken right into the roll and this
means they never lets go off balance so

582

means they never lets go off balance so
 

583
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,310
means they never lets go off balance so
to do this real correctly there's a

584
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,320
to do this real correctly there's a
 

585
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,350
to do this real correctly there's a
momentary pause

586
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
momentary pause

you let it
go then you find it so there's a pause

604
