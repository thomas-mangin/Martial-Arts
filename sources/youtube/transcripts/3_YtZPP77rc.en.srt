00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,149
right so
his body thank you his body is giving in

172
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
his body thank you his body is giving in
 

173
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,750
his body thank you his body is giving in
to the technique

174
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
to the technique
 

175
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,589
to the technique
rather than

176
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
rather than
 

177
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,550
rather than
him

178
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
him
 

179
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,910
him
being under sort of pressure so now

180
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
being under sort of pressure so now
 

181
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,589
being under sort of pressure so now
so now you haven't got any string but

182
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
so now you haven't got any string but
 

183
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,589
so now you haven't got any string but
you've got a person who still weighs a

184
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
you've got a person who still weighs a
 

185
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,710
you've got a person who still weighs a
lot and do the sheer nag again

186
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
lot and do the sheer nag again
 

187
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,309
lot and do the sheer nag again
well you don't weigh that much but

188
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
well you don't weigh that much but
 

189
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,589
well you don't weigh that much but
so he has to somehow work out

190
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
so he has to somehow work out
 

191
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,789
so he has to somehow work out
how he

192
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
how he
 

193
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,390
how he
goes that's better

194
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400

 

195
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,309

so we don't

196
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
so we don't
 

197
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,229
so we don't
um

198
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
um
 

199
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,270
um
we don't pin ourselves

200
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
we don't pin ourselves
 

201
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,589
we don't pin ourselves
to the form and sometimes or most of the

202
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
to the form and sometimes or most of the
 

203
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,710
to the form and sometimes or most of the
time we do we go well it's there it's

204
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
time we do we go well it's there it's
 

205
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,589
time we do we go well it's there it's
there it's there and about and then

206
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
there it's there and about and then
 

207
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,910
there it's there and about and then
you'll see you'll hear what we call

208
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
you'll see you'll hear what we call
 

209
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,390
you'll see you'll hear what we call
unbendable arm then also this unbendable

210
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
unbendable arm then also this unbendable
 

211
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,830
unbendable arm then also this unbendable
arm gets to a bent arm and you're

212
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
arm gets to a bent arm and you're
 

213
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,909
arm gets to a bent arm and you're
getting shorter and some people can even

214
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
getting shorter and some people can even
 

215
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,150
getting shorter and some people can even
pull you back because

216
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
pull you back because
 

217
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,870
pull you back because
you are not realizing

218
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
you are not realizing
 

219
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,550
you are not realizing
and this technique you're doing i'm not

220
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
and this technique you're doing i'm not
 

221
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,629
and this technique you're doing i'm not
going to go into the depth of it but

222
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
going to go into the depth of it but
 

223
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,670
going to go into the depth of it but
when you

224
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
when you
 

225
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,270
when you
do that

226
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
do that
 

227
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,030
do that
when you do that

228
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
when you do that
 

229
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,469
when you do that
you're actually

230
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
you're actually
 

231
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,710
you're actually
not becoming supple enough you might

232
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
not becoming supple enough you might
 

233
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
not becoming supple enough you might
need to with your buttock you might need

234
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
need to with your buttock you might need
 

235
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,590
need to with your buttock you might need
to actually go into them a little bit

236
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
to actually go into them a little bit
 

237
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670
to actually go into them a little bit
not giving anything you know so you

238
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
not giving anything you know so you
 

239
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,350
not giving anything you know so you
should be using the whole thing of

240
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
should be using the whole thing of
 

241
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,950
should be using the whole thing of
aikido you know people have been around

242
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
aikido you know people have been around
 

243
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,150
aikido you know people have been around
a long time you'll know you shouldn't uh

244
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160

 

245
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:58,070

i don't know what the word was um

246
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

247
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,909

equilibrium yeah

248
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
equilibrium yeah
 

249
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,670
equilibrium yeah
balance equally you know

250
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
balance equally you know
 

251
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,990
balance equally you know
if i can see my hands

252
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
if i can see my hands
 

253
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,150
if i can see my hands
they need to be at the same distance if

254
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
they need to be at the same distance if
 

255
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,150
they need to be at the same distance if
that's where the distance is and i bring

256
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
that's where the distance is and i bring
 

257
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,510
that's where the distance is and i bring
it down here

258
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
it down here
 

259
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,670
it down here
then i haven't got aikido you know i've

260
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
then i haven't got aikido you know i've
 

261
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,189
then i haven't got aikido you know i've
got this what they call the unbendable

262
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
got this what they call the unbendable
 

263
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,670
got this what they call the unbendable
arm so if you're going to start off here

264
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
arm so if you're going to start off here
 

265
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,629
arm so if you're going to start off here
you might have to move into them

266
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639

 

267
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,310

if you're training with someone this

268
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
if you're training with someone this
 

269
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,950
if you're training with someone this
high and you're this high forgets your

270
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
high and you're this high forgets your
 

271
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,670
high and you're this high forgets your
naggy it can't work oh i'll bend my

272
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
naggy it can't work oh i'll bend my
 

273
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,469
naggy it can't work oh i'll bend my
knees

it doesn't work
 

281
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,070
it doesn't work
you need to only do sheer naggies really

282
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
you need to only do sheer naggies really
 

283
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,310
you need to only do sheer naggies really
on you know you might go bow and then

284
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
on you know you might go bow and then
 

285
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,550
on you know you might go bow and then

all right so but if you can get somebody
similar height then you can do this a

294
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
similar height then you can do this a
 

295
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,230
similar height then you can do this a
shinagi all right so i'd like to just

296
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
shinagi all right so i'd like to just
 

297
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,469
shinagi all right so i'd like to just
switch now into the shia nagi

298
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
switch now into the shia nagi
 

299
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,309
switch now into the shia nagi
and see if you can keep your arms

300
