some people have tried with the kumi joe
 

365
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,629
some people have tried with the kumi joe
and again i think

366
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
and again i think
 

367
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,830
and again i think
try it any at any level the the ten kumi

368
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
try it any at any level the the ten kumi

is very complex
so

378
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
so
 

379
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,430
so
i think it's better to stick to the more

and yet the 31 is for speed
so you shouldn't be doing the 31

so you shouldn't be doing the 31
 

475
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,069
so you shouldn't be doing the 31
as the suburbs you should be doing it as
