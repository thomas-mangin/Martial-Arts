you see you you have an adhesion on this

you see you you have an adhesion on this
 

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,510

arm okay
 

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,510
arm okay
so you don't need to fumble here but you

16
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
so you don't need to fumble here but you
 

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,090
so you don't need to fumble here but you
can't let go of that adhesion okay it's

18
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100
can't let go of that adhesion okay it's
 

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,810
can't let go of that adhesion okay it's
on the inside of his arm so let's say uh

20
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:50,820
on the inside of his arm so let's say uh
 

21
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,569
on the inside of his arm so let's say uh
he tries to go forward I take it into

he tries to go forward I take it into
 

23

the circle
 

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,230
the circle
so for example he's trying to go forward

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
so for example he's trying to go forward
 

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,210
so for example he's trying to go forward
get right back into the circle there's a

28
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,220
get right back into the circle there's a
 

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,030
get right back into the circle there's a
forward pressure on it okay now here he

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
forward pressure on it okay now here he
 

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,670

tries to get up that's what I want

want to cut the joint I'm using the
joint lock to be in his Center

78

like using the joint lock
to put it in his

92
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,360
to put it in his
 

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,350
to put it in his

of his arm and into his Center hits his

104
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,400
of his arm and into his Center hits his
 

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,729
of his arm and into his Center hits his
body that's what makes him move it's

106

body that's what makes him move it's
 

107
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,729

still there
 

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,050
still there
so I'm gonna go around that energy and

112
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,060
so I'm gonna go around that energy and
 

113
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,930
so I'm gonna go around that energy and
that's when it to push on me you see

205
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:26,270

I'll show two hand transition details in

206
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,280
I'll show two hand transition details in
 

207
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,270
I'll show two hand transition details in
the version we're doing okay so we'll we

208
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
the version we're doing okay so we'll we
 

209
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,570
the version we're doing okay so we'll we
have the first part

210
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:32,580

 

211
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,330

this far here okay

212
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,340
this far here okay
 

213
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,129
this far here okay
so

214
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:37,139
so
 

215
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,529
so
this comes here this little takeover

216
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:39,539
this comes here this little takeover
 

217
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,290
this comes here this little takeover
there there you have your elbow control

218
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,300
there there you have your elbow control
 

219
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,110

I'm going to go inside and go to that

220
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm going to go inside and go to that
 

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,210
I'm going to go inside and go to that
adhesion control

222
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,220
adhesion control
 

223
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,150
adhesion control
then they'll have a fulcrum here in

224
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
then they'll have a fulcrum here in
 

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,070
then they'll have a fulcrum here in
between this fulcrum

226
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
between this fulcrum
 

227
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,210
between this fulcrum
and this elbow control I can turn my

228
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
and this elbow control I can turn my
 

229
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,110
and this elbow control I can turn my
hands

230

you need to put those finger locks in a
 

269
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,170
you need to put those finger locks in a
place where the energy can go into him

270
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,180
place where the energy can go into him
 

271
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,990

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,769

here is the PIN okay that the elbow goes

304
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:39,779
here is the PIN okay that the elbow goes
 

305
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,850
here is the PIN okay that the elbow goes
in place and you can see how

306
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:42,860
in place and you can see how
 

307
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,350
in place and you can see how
mechanically awkward that is

308
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
mechanically awkward that is
 

309
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,550
mechanically awkward that is
so

310
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
so
 

311
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,070
so
open up this finger

312
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,080

how I would be here right it's going to
 

321
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,190
how I would be here right it's going to
get very awkward that's very awkward so

322

get very awkward that's very awkward so
 

323
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,530
get very awkward that's very awkward so
before it gets awkward I change Hans I'm

324
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:03,540
before it gets awkward I change Hans I'm
 

325
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,829
before it gets awkward I change Hans I'm
in the same block same lock

326

this controls the elbow to give me the

328
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:08,940
this controls the elbow to give me the
 

329
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,389
this controls the elbow to give me the
bend to give me the leverage I need so

330
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:11,399
bend to give me the leverage I need so
 

331
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,670
bend to give me the leverage I need so
he has a straight arm you'll come Bend

332
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
he has a straight arm you'll come Bend
 

333
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,130
he has a straight arm you'll come Bend
his elbow you'll get it you can do it

334
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,140
his elbow you'll get it you can do it
 

335
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,090
his elbow you'll get it you can do it
this way

336
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,100
this way
 

337
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,130
this way
you can do it with the technique key on

338
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,140
you can do it with the technique key on
 

339
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,590
you can do it with the technique key on
but you can't have a straight arm

340
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
but you can't have a straight arm
 

341

343
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,670
he'll be too strong
then

344
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
