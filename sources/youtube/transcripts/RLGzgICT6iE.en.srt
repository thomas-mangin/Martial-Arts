is very close look how close we are
see and we would probably start

296
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:10,860
see and we would probably start
 

297
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,430
see and we would probably start
grappling that's an option you can you

298
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
grappling that's an option you can you
 

299
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,830
grappling that's an option you can you
can go the stick and you'll start

300
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
can go the stick and you'll start
 

301
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,330
can go the stick and you'll start
grappling

302
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,340
grappling
 

303
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,850
grappling
but he wants to go back to his weapon

304
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:19,860
but he wants to go back to his weapon
 

305
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,150
but he wants to go back to his weapon
and that's why he deviates and comes

306
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,160
and that's why he deviates and comes
 

307
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,350
and that's why he deviates and comes
around

308
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,360
around
 

309
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,050
around

so we'll trade rolls

332
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,040
so we'll trade rolls
 

333
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,310
so we'll trade rolls
ski attack the disarm the fans boom that

334
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,320
ski attack the disarm the fans boom that
 

335
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,570
ski attack the disarm the fans boom that
would have been the end

336
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:11,580

 

337
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,870

so instead as I see back to back one

338
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
so instead as I see back to back one
 

339
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,350
so instead as I see back to back one
move other side okay as I ski it I

340
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
move other side okay as I ski it I
 

341
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,930
move other side okay as I ski it I
realize I come around

342
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:20,940
realize I come around
 

343
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,690
realize I come around
I deviate around

344
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:23,700
I deviate around
 

345
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,090
I deviate around
but I want to move out of the grappling

346
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,100
but I want to move out of the grappling
 

347
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,470
but I want to move out of the grappling
range

348
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,480
range
 

349
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,790
range
so

350
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
so
 

351
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,170
so
boom

352
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,180
boom
 

353
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,870
boom
boom

354
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:31,880
boom
 

355
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,310
boom
boom here

356
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320

 

357
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,350

there's a win

358
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
there's a win
 

359
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,550
there's a win
when you do it when he goes from the hot

360
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:43,560
when you do it when he goes from the hot
 

361
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,730
when you do it when he goes from the hot
eye to the ski that's a Yin space

362
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:46,740
eye to the ski that's a Yin space
 

363
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,829
eye to the ski that's a Yin space
so around

364
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
so around
 

365
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,449
so around
boom pop rolls there is when I can move

366
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:56,459

 

367
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,570

you have a couple ways of doing it

368
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,580

 

369
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:15,710

you can do your front foot

370
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,720

 

371
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,389

and if I do the back foot

372
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399

 

373
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,630

but the problem with the back foot is

374
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:23,640
but the problem with the back foot is
 

375
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,090
but the problem with the back foot is
you're still in grappling range so he's

376
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,100
you're still in grappling range so he's
 

377
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,829
you're still in grappling range so he's
going to kick you boom

378
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

379
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,210

so I like the front foot

380
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,220

 

381
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,930

around
 

385
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,110
around
okay and then

386
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
okay and then
 

387
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,329
okay and then
he won't have his kick

388
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:44,339
he won't have his kick
 

389
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,590
he won't have his kick
he won't have the strike I force him to

390
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,600
he won't have the strike I force him to
 

391
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,410
he won't have the strike I force him to
have a boom to defend his head so he's

392
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:51,420
have a boom to defend his head so he's
 

393
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,389
have a boom to defend his head so he's
got a deviate

394
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
got a deviate
 

395
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,490
got a deviate
and here it is right here

396
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,500
and here it is right here
 

397
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,930
and here it is right here
okay

398
00:10:59,930 --> 00:10:59,940

 

399
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,290

so we're not trading blows I'm forcing

400
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,300
so we're not trading blows I'm forcing
 

401
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,750
so we're not trading blows I'm forcing
him to counter if he does not counter

402
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
him to counter if he does not counter
 

403
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,889
him to counter if he does not counter
he's going to get hit by that technique

404
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:09,899
he's going to get hit by that technique
 

405
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:18,130
he's going to get hit by that technique
foreign

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,140

 

407
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,610

that strike now so when he comes around

408
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:22,620
that strike now so when he comes around
 

409
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,170
that strike now so when he comes around
oh I yield

410
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,180

so he's got to withdraw and then his

430
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:47,459
so he's got to withdraw and then his
 

431
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,110
so he's got to withdraw and then his
body flow comes in you see

432
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
body flow comes in you see
 

433
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,949
body flow comes in you see
so he hit the he killed the weapon he

434

so he hit the he killed the weapon he
 

435
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,650
so he hit the he killed the weapon he
withdraws and now I'm going to do

436
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
withdraws and now I'm going to do
 

437
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,930
withdraws and now I'm going to do

ushino tenkon because he's gonna miss

442
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
ushino tenkon because he's gonna miss
 

443
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,730
ushino tenkon because he's gonna miss
and then what's he gonna do he's going

444
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
and then what's he gonna do he's going
 

445
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,710
and then what's he gonna do he's going
to want to draw it again

446
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
to want to draw it again
 

447
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,630
to want to draw it again
right that's when I hit him

448
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:17,640

 

449
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,870

so at the beginning he sees

450
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
so at the beginning he sees
 

451
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,310
so at the beginning he sees
ushiro tenkon

461
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,110
hit
so part one has a lot of ushiro tenkon

462
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
so part one has a lot of ushiro tenkon
 

463
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,790
so part one has a lot of ushiro tenkon
in it okay try it again

464
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:49,800

you think
 

483
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,810
you think
okay so there's a lot of angle deviation

484
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:20,820
okay so there's a lot of angle deviation
 

485
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,750
okay so there's a lot of angle deviation
that is in your defense it's not

486
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
that is in your defense it's not
 

487
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,509
that is in your defense it's not
deflection it's not his weapons there

488
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,519
deflection it's not his weapons there
 

489
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,509
deflection it's not his weapons there
and you move it out of the way you get

490
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
and you move it out of the way you get
 

491
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,889

out of the way
 

493
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,310
out of the way
and your deflection angle is redundant

494
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
and your deflection angle is redundant
 

495
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,210
and your deflection angle is redundant
with your deviation angle it's not

496

with your deviation angle it's not
 

497
