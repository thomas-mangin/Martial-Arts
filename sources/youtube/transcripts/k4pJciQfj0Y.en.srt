a wide humming position

112
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
a wide humming position
 

113
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,670

uh slowly as low as it is possible on

122
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
uh slowly as low as it is possible on
 

123
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,390
uh slowly as low as it is possible on
this straight line

124
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
this straight line
 

125
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,830
this straight line
and from here stand up and hand me

126
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
and from here stand up and hand me
 

127
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,750
and from here stand up and hand me
so start from humming position drop down

128
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
so start from humming position drop down
 

129
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,430
so start from humming position drop down
your center

130
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
your center
 

131
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,550
your center
make a circle also try to watch your

belly
 

135
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,990
belly
so you can keep your back circular

136
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000

 

137
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,990

and humming as you get confidence

138
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
and humming as you get confidence
 

139
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,350
and humming as you get confidence
you can increase the speed and also go

140
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
you can increase the speed and also go
 

141
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:10,149
you can increase the speed and also go
more to the front

142
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159

 

143
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,509

in actual practice when we get from

144
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519

 

145
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,830

the partner is standing behind us so we

146
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
the partner is standing behind us so we
 

147
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,430
the partner is standing behind us so we
have to turn backwards

148
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
have to turn backwards
 

149
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,390
have to turn backwards
a very simple or common way to do this

150
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
a very simple or common way to do this
 

151
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,790
a very simple or common way to do this
is

152
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
is
 

153
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,270
is
just to turn like this

154
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
just to turn like this
 

155
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,869
just to turn like this
using a tank i step or in other way

156
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
using a tank i step or in other way
 

157
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,350
using a tank i step or in other way
what i personally prefer to do is to get

158
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
what i personally prefer to do is to get
 

159
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,110
what i personally prefer to do is to get
in a toe crunch position

160
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120

 

161
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,830

turning as fast as it is possible and

162
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
turning as fast as it is possible and
 

163
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,229
turning as fast as it is possible and
then i can use both of my legs to stand

164
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
then i can use both of my legs to stand
 

165
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,869
then i can use both of my legs to stand
up straightly

166
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
up straightly
 

167
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,030
up straightly
and humming position

168
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040

 

169
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,789

another way that you can see in the

170
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
another way that you can see in the
 

171
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,070
another way that you can see in the
aikikai circle

172
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
aikikai circle
 

173
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,789
aikikai circle
is something like this

174
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799

 

175
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,190

however uh during this motion you're

176
