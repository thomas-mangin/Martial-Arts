what would allow

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
what would allow
 

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,310
what would allow
me to to deceive myself get the result

4
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
me to to deceive myself get the result
 

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,069
me to to deceive myself get the result
the apparent result

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
the apparent result
 

7
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,950
the apparent result
without actually getting the result

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
without actually getting the result
 

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,110
without actually getting the result
you didn't step forward

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
you didn't step forward
 

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,270
you didn't step forward
no that is the result somehow predicting

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
no that is the result somehow predicting
 

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,510
no that is the result somehow predicting
okay but we they couldn't let go any

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
okay but we they couldn't let go any
 

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,869
okay but we they couldn't let go any
time so

16
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
time so
 

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,069
time so
that wouldn't be what's going on here

18
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
that wouldn't be what's going on here
 

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,069
that wouldn't be what's going on here
the stress is not big enough that's

20
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
the stress is not big enough that's
 

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:10,950
the stress is not big enough that's
exactly it okay you got it

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960

 

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,109

on her drew a little better

24
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119

 

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,230

there you go

26
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
there you go
 

27

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,550

get more bracing if you want you know

52
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
get more bracing if you want you know
 

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,670
get more bracing if you want you know
what i mean like

54
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680

 

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,590

you understand
 

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,830
you understand
that's what i'm grabbing

58
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
that's what i'm grabbing
 

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,070

okay
 

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,949
okay
what are the two things you expect is

64
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
what are the two things you expect is
 

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,190
what are the two things you expect is
going to happen

66
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
going to happen
 

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,910
going to happen
by increasing the stress

68
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
by increasing the stress
 

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,510
by increasing the stress
you're getting pushed backwards you're

70
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
you're getting pushed backwards you're
 

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,190
you're getting pushed backwards you're
going to get pushed over backwards

72
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200

 

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,470

so ronnie you're gonna do the same level

74
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
so ronnie you're gonna do the same level
 

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,150
so ronnie you're gonna do the same level
same exact level

76
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
same exact level
 

77
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,350
same exact level
go

78
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
go
 

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,390
go
okay oh i'm not even in the ballpark you

80
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
okay oh i'm not even in the ballpark you
 

81
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,830
okay oh i'm not even in the ballpark you
get it

82
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
get it
 

83
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,630
get it
okay or the other one is

84
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
okay or the other one is
 

85
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,070
okay or the other one is
you're gonna go forward because you're

86
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
you're gonna go forward because you're
 

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,110
you're gonna go forward because you're
gonna break something okay got it so we

88
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
gonna break something okay got it so we
 

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,869
gonna break something okay got it so we
have to up the

90
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
have to up the
 

91
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,070
have to up the
stress to assess more correctly okay go

92
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
stress to assess more correctly okay go
 

93
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,750
stress to assess more correctly okay go
higher

94
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760

 

95
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,350

99
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,229

this is not about being so powerful that

100
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
this is not about being so powerful that
 

101
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,149
this is not about being so powerful that
he can't move me

102

you always want to move fighting is
 

105
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,070
you always want to move fighting is
about moving okay

106
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
about moving okay
 

107
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,390
about moving okay
but

108
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
but
 

109
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,229

you you could you don't it's not even
about stability

138
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
about stability
 

139
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,390
about stability
it's about where energy goes

140
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
it's about where energy goes
 

141
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,789
it's about where energy goes
okay do you understand so

142
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
okay do you understand so
 

143
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,670
okay do you understand so
uh for example don't move anymore

uh for example don't move anymore
 

145
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,390
uh for example don't move anymore
i'm going to do that same energy

146
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
i'm going to do that same energy
 

147
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,750
i'm going to do that same energy

do you get it i'm doing different things
 

181
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,110
do you get it i'm doing different things

you start to disorganize
 

359
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,749
you start to disorganize
these four corners

360
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
these four corners
 

361
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,430
these four corners
okay

362
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
okay
 

363
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,670
okay
but you have to think of them not

364
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
but you have to think of them not
 

365
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,430
but you have to think of them not
two-dimensionally

366
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
two-dimensionally
 

367
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,629
two-dimensionally
so

368
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639

 

369
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,909

this is wrong this is wrong this is

370
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
this is wrong this is wrong this is
 

371
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,629
this is wrong this is wrong this is
wrong do you get it they have to stay

372
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
wrong do you get it they have to stay
 

373
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,230
wrong do you get it they have to stay
in that place okay so let's say i'm here

374
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
in that place okay so let's say i'm here
 

375
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,550
in that place okay so let's say i'm here
and i you can feel the ground right and

376
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
and i you can feel the ground right and
 

377
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,070
and i you can feel the ground right and
then as he starts to push do you see

378
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
then as he starts to push do you see
 

379
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,310
then as he starts to push do you see
this this thing starting to turn this

380
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
this this thing starting to turn this
 

381
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,149
this this thing starting to turn this
thing's starting to turn this thing's

382
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
thing's starting to turn this thing's
 

383
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,870
thing's starting to turn this thing's
starting to drop and now it's very hard

384
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
starting to drop and now it's very hard
 

385
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,750
starting to drop and now it's very hard
to ground and as he increases the stress

386
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
to ground and as he increases the stress
 

387
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,829
to ground and as he increases the stress
i cannot do it

388
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
i cannot do it
 

389
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,149
i cannot do it
again at the beginning levels that's

390
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
again at the beginning levels that's
 

391
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,350
again at the beginning levels that's
what will happen of course uh once he he

392
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
what will happen of course uh once he he
 

393
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,070
what will happen of course uh once he he
pushes he pushes right

394
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
pushes he pushes right
 

395
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,230
pushes he pushes right
none of that is important none of that

396
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
none of that is important none of that
 

397
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,030
none of that is important none of that
is important you could do uh

398
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
is important you could do uh
 

399
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,590
is important you could do uh
goofy stuff none of it is important okay

400
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
goofy stuff none of it is important okay
 

401
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,310
goofy stuff none of it is important okay
but at the beginning it is important

402
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
but at the beginning it is important
 

403
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,430
but at the beginning it is important
you got it

you to try to hold
those four corners

418
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
those four corners
 

419
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,710

as he starts to increase

422
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
as he starts to increase
 

423
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,550
as he starts to increase
you

424

you
 

425
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,550
you
you just keep those four corners in

426
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
you just keep those four corners in
 

427
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,949
you just keep those four corners in
place okay you understand don't let it

428
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
place okay you understand don't let it
 

429
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,670
place okay you understand don't let it
start dipping and start dismantling that

430
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
start dipping and start dismantling that
 

431
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,750
start dipping and start dismantling that
organization that's where you put your

432
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
organization that's where you put your
 

433
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,670
organization that's where you put your
effort and energy okay try

434
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
effort and energy okay try
 

435
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,509
effort and energy okay try
so i do have to hold those corners but

436
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
so i do have to hold those corners but
 

437
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,190
so i do have to hold those corners but
now what you guys are doing is you don't

438
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
now what you guys are doing is you don't
 

439
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,190
now what you guys are doing is you don't
have midfoot weight

440
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
have midfoot weight
 

441
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,190
have midfoot weight
you're you're back here okay

442
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
you're you're back here okay
 

443
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,230
you're you're back here okay
again

444
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
again
 

445
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,550
again
as when you when you get when you

446
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
as when you when you get when you
 

447
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,030
as when you when you get when you
understand it energetically you don't

448
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
understand it energetically you don't
 

449
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,750
understand it energetically you don't
need mid-foot weight i can be on my

450
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
need mid-foot weight i can be on my
 

451
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,470
need mid-foot weight i can be on my
heels and it'll still work okay but at

452
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
heels and it'll still work okay but at
 

453
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,829
heels and it'll still work okay but at
the beginning

454
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
the beginning
 

455
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,949
the beginning
you can't

456
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
you can't
 

457
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,350
you can't
you're asking too much okay

458
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
you're asking too much okay
 

459
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,190
you're asking too much okay
um

460
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
um
 

461
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,389
um
so

462
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
so
 

463
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,310
so
mid-foot

464
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
mid-foot
 

465
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,750
mid-foot
midfoot

466
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
midfoot
 

467
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,590
midfoot
right there

468
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
right there
 

469
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,030
right there
is where

470
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
is where
 

471
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,069
is where
you position these four corners

472
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
you position these four corners
 

473
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,269
you position these four corners
so that

474
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
so that
 

475
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,430
so that
your weight

476
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
your weight
 

477
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,150
your weight
is dropping on that thing on that point

478
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
is dropping on that thing on that point
 

479
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,190
is dropping on that thing on that point
do you get it not on my heel do you see

480
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
do you get it not on my heel do you see
 

481
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,230
do you get it not on my heel do you see
that

482
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
that
 

483
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,949
that
not on my arch

484
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
not on my arch
 

485
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,829
not on my arch
not on the outside of my foot and not on

486
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
not on the outside of my foot and not on
 

487
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,350
not on the outside of my foot and not on
my toes

488
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
my toes
 

489
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,310
my toes
got it it goes all my weight

490
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
got it it goes all my weight
 

491
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,110
got it it goes all my weight
goes right on that spot

492
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
goes right on that spot
 

493
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,509
goes right on that spot
and his energy

494
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
and his energy
 

495
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,550
and his energy
goes right in that spot too and i hold

496
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
goes right in that spot too and i hold
 

497
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,670
goes right in that spot too and i hold
these four corners just like you were

498
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
these four corners just like you were
 

499
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,870
these four corners just like you were
so that that spot is getting heavier and

500
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
so that that spot is getting heavier and
 

501
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,470
so that that spot is getting heavier and
heavier and heavier i hold those corners

502
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
heavier and heavier i hold those corners
 

503
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,910
heavier and heavier i hold those corners
not letting it do this stuff do you see

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,870
getting better okay
so uh again if we're gonna assess we're

530
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
so uh again if we're gonna assess we're
 

531
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,870
so uh again if we're gonna assess we're
trying to increase the stress at that

532
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
trying to increase the stress at that
 

533
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,310
trying to increase the stress at that
time to make sure that our form is

534
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
time to make sure that our form is
 

535
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,870
time to make sure that our form is
more uh accurately

536
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880

 

537
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,269

manifested so we're gonna do another one

538
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
manifested so we're gonna do another one
 

539
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,030
manifested so we're gonna do another one
okay so uh this one i don't have that

540
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
okay so uh this one i don't have that
 

541
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,389
okay so uh this one i don't have that
racing angle at all do you see that so

542
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
racing angle at all do you see that so
 

543
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,190
racing angle at all do you see that so
he's gonna push and it's gonna go into

544
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
he's gonna push and it's gonna go into
 

545
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,150
he's gonna push and it's gonna go into
my

546
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160

547
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,190
my
uh same mid foot same four corner drill

548
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
uh same mid foot same four corner drill
 

549
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,269
uh same mid foot same four corner drill
okay but what i'm going to do is i'm

550
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
okay but what i'm going to do is i'm
 

551
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,870
okay but what i'm going to do is i'm
going to take it off myself

552
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
going to take it off myself
 

553
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,750
going to take it off myself
okay it's no different than if he takes

554
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
okay it's no different than if he takes
 

555
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,949
okay it's no different than if he takes
it off

556
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
it off
 

557
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,509
it off
i don't go flying

558
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
i don't go flying
 

559
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,310
i don't go flying
so

560
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
so
 

561
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,350
so
if i'm here he's pushing driving when i

562
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
if i'm here he's pushing driving when i
 

563
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,910
if i'm here he's pushing driving when i
take it off i shouldn't go flying

564
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
take it off i shouldn't go flying
 

565
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,949
take it off i shouldn't go flying
onto my toes i didn't take that energy

566
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
onto my toes i didn't take that energy
 

567
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,069
onto my toes i didn't take that energy
keep it down and then we're going to

568
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
keep it down and then we're going to
 

569
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,629
keep it down and then we're going to
yawn it back into place

570
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639

 

571
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,710

i should not go bouncing off do you see

572
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
i should not go bouncing off do you see
 

573
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,269
i should not go bouncing off do you see
that so it's the same drill but just

574
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
that so it's the same drill but just
 

575
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,790
that so it's the same drill but just
done a little bit more dynamically so

576
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
done a little bit more dynamically so
 

577
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,350
done a little bit more dynamically so
pull here and hop and pop

578
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360

 

579
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,590

what would be wrong is of course i can't

580
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
what would be wrong is of course i can't
 

581
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,750
what would be wrong is of course i can't
do it

582
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
do it
 

583
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,629
do it
or two when i go off i fail forward or

584
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
or two when i go off i fail forward or
 

585
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,509
or two when i go off i fail forward or

off okay so all of those different
energies

590
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
