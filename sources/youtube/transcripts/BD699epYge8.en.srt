well i was staggered from that day to

282
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
well i was staggered from that day to
 

283
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,430
well i was staggered from that day to
this i'm staggered that anybody could do

284
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
this i'm staggered that anybody could do
 

285
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,550

was he paused and then said

288
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
was he paused and then said
 

289
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,909
was he paused and then said
with weights

290
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
with weights
 

291
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,510
with weights
so

292
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
so
 

293
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,070
so
this would be class to most people as

294
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
this would be class to most people as
 

295
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,990
this would be class to most people as
being superhuman

296
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
being superhuman
 

297
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,110
being superhuman
but it's possible

298
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120

 

299
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,230
