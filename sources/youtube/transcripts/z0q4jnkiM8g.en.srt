00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,110

all right so you're going to you don't

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,120
all right so you're going to you don't
 

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,710
all right so you're going to you don't
need your B in you want to put your

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
need your B in you want to put your
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,070
need your B in you want to put your
mind and that includes your tips the tip

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
mind and that includes your tips the tip
 

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,990
mind and that includes your tips the tip
into the mid foot so when you pick it up

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
into the mid foot so when you pick it up
 

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,429
into the mid foot so when you pick it up
you're pushing down on that on that mid

10
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:18,439
you're pushing down on that on that mid
 

11
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,029
you're pushing down on that on that mid
foot don't try to get leverage here you

12
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:22,039
foot don't try to get leverage here you
 

13
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,990
foot don't try to get leverage here you
should

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
should
 

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,950
should
feel pushing that okay

16
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:33,960

 

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,950

good I feel that weight he's amplifying

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:37,960
good I feel that weight he's amplifying
 

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,790
good I feel that weight he's amplifying
the way so I can feel it okay and I

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:41,800
the way so I can feel it okay and I
 

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,110
the way so I can feel it okay and I
picked that up with those mechanics you

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
picked that up with those mechanics you
 

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,990
picked that up with those mechanics you
don't have to make it like he's trying

24
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,000
don't have to make it like he's trying
 

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,110
don't have to make it like he's trying
to shove down just some awareness there

26
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
to shove down just some awareness there
 

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,750
to shove down just some awareness there
okay little more than that okay you feel

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:54,760
okay little more than that okay you feel
 

29
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,189
okay little more than that okay you feel
it and you pick it up using it that way

30
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,199

 

31
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,390

so you hold

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,400

 

33
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,630

it when he tries to pick it up I'm not

34
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
it when he tries to pick it up I'm not
 

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,149
it when he tries to pick it up I'm not
going to sit here like that I just want

36
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
going to sit here like that I just want
 

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,830
going to sit here like that I just want
Amplified weight for you to pick it

38
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840

 

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,670

up okay so don't do what he

40
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:18,680
up okay so don't do what he
 

41
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,710
up okay so don't do what he
did just amplify it for them to feel it

42
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:21,720
did just amplify it for them to feel it
 

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,350
did just amplify it for them to feel it
get it in the foot and you keep a

44
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
get it in the foot and you keep a
 

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,550
get it in the foot and you keep a
constant pressure release it again

46
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560

 

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,630

but this is too light it's enough let it

48
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
but this is too light it's enough let it
 

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,469
but this is too light it's enough let it
charge and then he's lifting

50
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:37,479
charge and then he's lifting
 

51
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,789
charge and then he's lifting
that up as you're going okay right all

52
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
that up as you're going okay right all
 

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,469
that up as you're going okay right all
right let's try

54
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479

 

55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,749

that all right so we

56
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759

 

57
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,069

have this uh drill right she's you don't

58
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
have this uh drill right she's you don't
 

59
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,670
have this uh drill right she's you don't
have to stand in that right and I'm

60
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
have to stand in that right and I'm
 

61
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,069
have to stand in that right and I'm
grounding in the horse okay and we have

62
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
grounding in the horse okay and we have
 

63
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,709
grounding in the horse okay and we have
drill where they climb up the elbow and

64
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
drill where they climb up the elbow and
 

65
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,670
drill where they climb up the elbow and
I'm gling the horse stance she comes up

66
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
I'm gling the horse stance she comes up
 

67
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,469
I'm gling the horse stance she comes up
to the shoulder you don't need that

68
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:07,479
to the shoulder you don't need that
 

69
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,869
to the shoulder you don't need that
angle here okay and I'm grounding in the

70
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
angle here okay and I'm grounding in the
 

71
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,949
angle here okay and I'm grounding in the
horse stance and because the corner is

72
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:13,959
horse stance and because the corner is
 

73
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,190
horse stance and because the corner is
not

74
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
not
 

75
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,790
not
important okay I'm grounding in the hor

76
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
important okay I'm grounding in the hor
 

77
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,280
important okay I'm grounding in the hor
okay so you'll give me the

78
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,290
okay so you'll give me the
 

79
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,869
okay so you'll give me the
[Music]

80
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879
[Music]
 

81
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,270
[Music]
grounding and he'll give me that okay so

82
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,280
grounding and he'll give me that okay so
 

83
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,670
grounding and he'll give me that okay so
because the energy is the same

84
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
because the energy is the same
 

85
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,309
because the energy is the same
young aspect is being ground Vector so

86
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
young aspect is being ground Vector so
 

87
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,030
young aspect is being ground Vector so
this should not move me and that's the

88
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,040
this should not move me and that's the
 

89
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,309
this should not move me and that's the
one I'm using to lift the sword okay so

90
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
one I'm using to lift the sword okay so
 

91
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,509
one I'm using to lift the sword okay so
I'm not going to hit I don't want to hit

92
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,519
I'm not going to hit I don't want to hit
 

93

00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
this is the drill when you when when I
 

97
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,550
this is the drill when you when when I
lift his the tip uh the drills there but

98
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:55,560
lift his the tip uh the drills there but
 

99
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,869
lift his the tip uh the drills there but
we're going to exaggerate a little bit

100
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:57,879
we're going to exaggerate a little bit
 

101
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,309
we're going to exaggerate a little bit
and we'll come up

102
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
and we'll come up
 

103
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,670
and we'll come up
as far as I can without knocking her arm

104
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:02,680
as far as I can without knocking her arm
 

105
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:20,830
as far as I can without knocking her arm
off my chest

106
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:20,840

 

107
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,750

okay okay let's try all right now you

108
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
okay okay let's try all right now you
 

109
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,350
okay okay let's try all right now you
don't have the

110
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,360
don't have the
 

111
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,229
don't have the
amplification but you want to increase

112
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
amplification but you want to increase
 

113
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,990
amplification but you want to increase
your s ativities you still have weight I

114
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
your s ativities you still have weight I
 

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,470
your s ativities you still have weight I
still have

116
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
still have
 

117
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,149
still have
my weight there's young aspect in the

118
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
my weight there's young aspect in the
 

119
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:45,910
my weight there's young aspect in the
bulen and that's what picks

120
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920

 

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,830

up we're not going to do other

122
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:52,840

 

123
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,869

things those they're all different okay

124
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:55,879
things those they're all different okay
 

125
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,030
things those they're all different okay
all right so you should feel the tip

126
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,040
all right so you should feel the tip
 

127
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,030
all right so you should feel the tip
already and you're already holding it

128
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
already and you're already holding it
 

129
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,630
already and you're already holding it
with your mid foot you're already

130
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:03,640
with your mid foot you're already
 

131
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,789
with your mid foot you're already
holding it and it

132
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
holding it and it
 

133
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,149
holding it and it
moves with that mid foot

134
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,159

 

135
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,470

Vector oh feel it feel it feel it feel

136
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
Vector oh feel it feel it feel it feel
 

137
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,710
Vector oh feel it feel it feel it feel
it feel it you'll feel it go to the in

138
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
it feel it you'll feel it go to the in
 

139
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,270
it feel it you'll feel it go to the in
face boom come back down and you'll

140
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,280
face boom come back down and you'll
 

141
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,150
face boom come back down and you'll
catch it again coming back down on that
