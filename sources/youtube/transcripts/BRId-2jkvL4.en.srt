00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960

 

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,790

it's

4
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:37,800

 

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,029

okay so this side is's

6
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:41,039

 

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,470

pushing you always get him

8
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,480

 

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,869

turning and this one's cool because you

10
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:49,879
turning and this one's cool because you
 

11
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,069
turning and this one's cool because you
have two inward

12
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,079

 

13
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,790

Spirals and then after that we have two

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:55,800
Spirals and then after that we have two
 

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,150
Spirals and then after that we have two
hour spirals Okay so outside the

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,160
hour spirals Okay so outside the
 

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,910
hour spirals Okay so outside the
arm just like solto

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:06,920

 

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,149

kaien you just have to wait for the

20
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:09,159
kaien you just have to wait for the
 

21
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,990
kaien you just have to wait for the
other

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,000
other
 

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,109
other
one and then here's your two outward

24
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119

 

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,860

spirals so deviate under

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:20,870
spirals so deviate under
 

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:28,830
spirals so deviate under

okay try it
 

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,709
okay try it
again okay so I deviate

34
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
again okay so I deviate
 

35
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,069
again okay so I deviate
one look he's in the technique you see

36
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
one look he's in the technique you see
 

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,990
one look he's in the technique you see
you hear C hole right

38
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000

 

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,110

here there go go here here

now
 

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,949
now
DV is

44
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:19,959
DV is
 

45
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,589
DV is
in

in
 

47
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,470
in
that DV

48
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480
that DV
 

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,190
that DV
there okay got that okay let's try it

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
there okay got that okay let's try it
 

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,270
there okay got that okay let's try it
again technique like this a lot of theid

52
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
again technique like this a lot of theid
 

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,270
again technique like this a lot of theid
get scared they can't figure out what

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
back their tanden from the Keyon
 

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,910
back their tanden from the Keyon
remembering key after the tanden form

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:42,920
remembering key after the tanden form
 

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,750
remembering key after the tanden form
he's going to let me move his tanden

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:44,760
he's going to let me move his tanden
 

63
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,390
he's going to let me move his tanden
around but the scared do kid is always

64
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
around but the scared do kid is always
 

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,869

okay B because in essence he's
 

103
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,630
okay B because in essence he's
countering the technique you see the

104
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
countering the technique you see the
 

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,229
countering the technique you see the
technique I guess we're doing Gaza

106
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
technique I guess we're doing Gaza
 

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,869
technique I guess we're doing Gaza
that we don't do that in

108
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
that we don't do that in

not to counter the technique you kind go
 

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,110
not to counter the technique you kind go
