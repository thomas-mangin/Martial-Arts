10
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:11,700
thumb goes in the middle
 

11
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,450
thumb goes in the middle
the bird's beak goes over

12
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,460

36
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
position
 

37
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,430
position
it comes up

38
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
it comes up
 

39
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,650
it comes up
it goes over

40
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:51,660
it goes over
 

41
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,209
it goes over
and I'm going to go through all these

42
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:53,219
and I'm going to go through all these
 

43
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,090
and I'm going to go through all these
other pieces

44
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100

 

45
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,970

so
 

55
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,289
so
he's on the line his arm's on the line

56
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:15,299
he's on the line his arm's on the line
 

57
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,210
he's on the line his arm's on the line
and this is what's happening those who

58
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,220
and this is what's happening those who
 

59
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,630
and this is what's happening those who
can see it you're sort of turning over

60
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
can see it you're sort of turning over
 

61
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,969
can see it you're sort of turning over
and it's going this side the line and

62
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:22,979
and it's going this side the line and
 

63
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,530
and it's going this side the line and
then by the time you get there it's gone

64
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:24,540
then by the time you get there it's gone
 

65
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,230
then by the time you get there it's gone
that side of the line

66
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,240
that side of the line
 

67
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,170
that side of the line
and you you know you third downs and

68
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,180
and you you know you third downs and
 

69
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,330
and you you know you third downs and
above really should be

70
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,340
above really should be
 

71
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,670
above really should be
keeping it exactly

72
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:34,680
keeping it exactly
 

73
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,330
keeping it exactly
on the line and you should be moving you

74
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,340
on the line and you should be moving you
 

75
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,609
on the line and you should be moving you
should be moving

76
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619
should be moving
 

77
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,450
should be moving
