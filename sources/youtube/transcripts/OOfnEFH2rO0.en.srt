something so and what I do is not try to

144
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
something so and what I do is not try to
 

145
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,430
something so and what I do is not try to
make myself strong and pull against him

146
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,440
make myself strong and pull against him
 

147
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,469
make myself strong and pull against him
okay I try to find the in space so he

148
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
okay I try to find the in space so he
 

149
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,390
okay I try to find the in space so he
wants to cut that hand down and bring it

150
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,400
wants to cut that hand down and bring it
 

151
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,909
wants to cut that hand down and bring it
here where he can eventually pull it

152
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
here where he can eventually pull it
 

153
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,189
here where he can eventually pull it
backwards so what I do is a 90°

154
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
backwards so what I do is a 90°
 

155
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,150
backwards so what I do is a 90°
fluctuation to his angle of attack and

156
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
fluctuation to his angle of attack and
 

157
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,430
fluctuation to his angle of attack and
it goes

158
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
it goes
 

159
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,189
it goes
into y space there's nothing there even

160
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,199
into y space there's nothing there even
 

161
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,150
into y space there's nothing there even
though we're touching there's nothing

162
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,160
though we're touching there's nothing
 

163
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,110
though we're touching there's nothing
there and I start to open up his back

164
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,120
there and I start to open up his back
 

165
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,909
there and I start to open up his back

for that is
 

445
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,310
for that is
youring of e right there okay so we'll

446
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,320
youring of e right there okay so we'll
 

447
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,230
youring of e right there okay so we'll
take it to a tap and we'll stop for hey

448
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,240
take it to a tap and we'll stop for hey
 

449
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:29,189
take it to a tap and we'll stop for hey
let's try War here

450
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199

 

451
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,470

body arm right here okay now we have to

452
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
body arm right here okay now we have to
 

453
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,470
body arm right here okay now we have to
tighten up the tendons for the C so I

454
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,480
tighten up the tendons for the C so I
 

455
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,389
tighten up the tendons for the C so I
had to bring my leg in and there's

456
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
had to bring my leg in and there's
 

457
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,829
had to bring my leg in and there's
another lock here right here boom on the

458
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
another lock here right here boom on the
 

459
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,590
another lock here right here boom on the
shoulder and then there's another

460
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
shoulder and then there's another
 

461
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,310
shoulder and then there's another
dislocation here on the whole scapula

462
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
dislocation here on the whole scapula
 

463
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,189
dislocation here on the whole scapula
mechanism so I kind of release it as I

464
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
mechanism so I kind of release it as I
 

465
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,949
mechanism so I kind of release it as I
go let him out of it and we're in the EO

466
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
go let him out of it and we're in the EO
 

467
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,550
go let him out of it and we're in the EO
pit

468
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560

 

469
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:34,080

o

470
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,090
