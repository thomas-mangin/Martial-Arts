okay um the next one will catch on one

182
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
okay um the next one will catch on one
 

183
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,909
okay um the next one will catch on one
side so you can catch on the quad catch

184
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
side so you can catch on the quad catch
 

185
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,670
side so you can catch on the quad catch
on the shoulder release if you're going

186
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
on the shoulder release if you're going
 

187
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,110
on the shoulder release if you're going
to catch on one side here work on that

188
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
to catch on one side here work on that
 

189
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,070
to catch on one side here work on that
side you see I

190
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
side you see I
 

191
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,629
side you see I
work catch the other

192
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639

 

193
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,589

side

194
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,599

 

195
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,550

and of course you can't combine the two

196
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
and of course you can't combine the two
 

197
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,230
and of course you can't combine the two
so I start with one and then I catch on

198
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,240
so I start with one and then I catch on
 

199
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,749
so I start with one and then I catch on
the other

200
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759

 

201
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,670

side and catch

202
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680

 

203
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,629

here both one

204
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
here both one
 

205
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,189
here both one
side okay and what you want to do with

206
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
side okay and what you want to do with
 

207
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,150
side okay and what you want to do with
this catch is uh I want to catch it for

208
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,160
this catch is uh I want to catch it for
 

209
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,909
this catch is uh I want to catch it for
you to land on the CQ okay as opposed to

210
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
you to land on the CQ okay as opposed to
 

211
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,270
you to land on the CQ okay as opposed to
we do this stuff here and then I press

212
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,280
we do this stuff here and then I press
 

213
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,350
we do this stuff here and then I press
into the C okay on

214
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:44,360
into the C okay on
 

215
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:52,710
into the C okay on
these I land

216
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720

 

217
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,990

you okay and let's so let's we're going

218
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
you okay and let's so let's we're going
 

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,990
you okay and let's so let's we're going
to catch we're going to mix the two

220
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
to catch we're going to mix the two
 

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,790
to catch we're going to mix the two
catching techniques but we want them to

222
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
catching techniques but we want them to
 

223
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,309
catching techniques but we want them to
land on the C okay projection

224
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:07,319
land on the C okay projection
 

225
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,869
land on the C okay projection
so there's you feel the pressure like

226
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:09,879
so there's you feel the pressure like
 

227
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,230
so there's you feel the pressure like
you're pushing on my ground Vector okay

228
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
you're pushing on my ground Vector okay
 

229
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,710
you're pushing on my ground Vector okay
now I'm going to catch you see and I now

230
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
now I'm going to catch you see and I now
 

231
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,550
now I'm going to catch you see and I now
take that pressure there you feel it's

232
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
take that pressure there you feel it's
 

233
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,510
take that pressure there you feel it's
right it's there but I'm not positive y

234
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,520
right it's there but I'm not positive y
 

235
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,230
right it's there but I'm not positive y
to you okay and so normally what we do

236
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
to you okay and so normally what we do
 

237
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,830
to you okay and so normally what we do
is we push on

238
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:30,840
is we push on
 

239
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,830
is we push on
that I get positive y the same thing the

240
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:34,840
that I get positive y the same thing the
 

241
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,029
that I get positive y the same thing the
yield and then we

242
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:38,039
yield and then we
 

243
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,950
yield and then we
push and sometimes you push with your

244
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
push and sometimes you push with your
 

245
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,270
push and sometimes you push with your
hand so your he your hand comes down

246
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
hand so your he your hand comes down
 

247
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,550
hand so your he your hand comes down
okay but what we're trying to do now is

248
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:47,560
okay but what we're trying to do now is
 

249
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,469
okay but what we're trying to do now is
he's going to Boom it'll be positive y

250
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
he's going to Boom it'll be positive y
 

251
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:58,430
he's going to Boom it'll be positive y
here okay so

252
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440

 

253
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:06,510

in

254
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:06,520

 

255
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,790

there you can see I don't need to make

256
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
there you can see I don't need to make
 

257
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,309
there you can see I don't need to make
my arm come out I don't need to go

258
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
my arm come out I don't need to go
 

259
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,550
my arm come out I don't need to go
forward he just lands on

260
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
forward he just lands on
 

261
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,149
forward he just lands on
it okay that's what we're trying to do

262
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:20,159
it okay that's what we're trying to do
 

263
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,070
it okay that's what we're trying to do
catch him and land him in the projection

264
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
catch him and land him in the projection
 

265
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,149
catch him and land him in the projection
Point okay try it again to the other

266
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159
Point okay try it again to the other
 

267
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,990
Point okay try it again to the other
half so

268
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
half so
 

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,269
half so
cokan is going here so you guys see

270
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
cokan is going here so you guys see
 

271
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,790
cokan is going here so you guys see
there it's going I'm going underneath it

272
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:35,800
there it's going I'm going underneath it
 

273
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,670
there it's going I'm going underneath it
and then I yield it there okay and then

274
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,680
and then I yield it there okay and then
 

275
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,750
and then I yield it there okay and then
that's

276
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:40,760
that's
 

277
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,509
that's
it so I'm not going to

278
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
it so I'm not going to
 

279
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,350
it so I'm not going to
go under it

280
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
go under it
 

281
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,389
go under it
yield and then

282
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:53,399

 

283
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,790

around and that's just where he land so

284
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
around and that's just where he land so
 

285
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,030
around and that's just where he land so
if you pay

286
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,040
if you pay
 

287
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,030
if you pay
attention it's still still in the

288
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,040
attention it's still still in the
 

289
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,829
attention it's still still in the
yielding position

290
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:02,839
yielding position
 

291
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,710
yielding position
okay um so when I yield over here you

292
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:07,720
okay um so when I yield over here you
 

293
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,670
okay um so when I yield over here you
can

294
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,680
can
 

295
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,750
can
see it's drawing a trajectory that

296
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:12,760
see it's drawing a trajectory that
 

297
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,150
see it's drawing a trajectory that
way so I need

298
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,160
way so I need
 

299
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,509
way so I need
you to be in this

300
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519

 

301
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,150

position so that that Force line

302
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
position so that that Force line
 

303
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,990
position so that that Force line
works you guys see that so you have to

304
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,000
works you guys see that so you have to
 

305
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,350
works you guys see that so you have to
go across it and then there's my X line

306
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
go across it and then there's my X line
 

307
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,590
go across it and then there's my X line
you

308
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,600
you
 

309
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,829
you
see so as as I go here boom this is

310
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:36,839
see so as as I go here boom this is
 

311
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,949
see so as as I go here boom this is
where you you see and so it's projecting

312
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
where you you see and so it's projecting
 

313
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,150
where you you see and so it's projecting
and IT projects that

314
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,160
and IT projects that
 

315
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,910
and IT projects that
way okay so that means this hand has to

316
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
way okay so that means this hand has to
 

317
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,750
way okay so that means this hand has to
do something can't do whatever it has to

318
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:48,760
do something can't do whatever it has to
 

319
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,389
do something can't do whatever it has to
get you there so again I go underneath

320
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
get you there so again I go underneath
 

321
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,710
get you there so again I go underneath
on the yield you see and then it has to

322
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
on the yield you see and then it has to
 

323
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,790
on the yield you see and then it has to
bring you there then this and in this

324
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
bring you there then this and in this
 

325
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,350
bring you there then this and in this
position can do its

326
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
position can do its
 

327
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,030
position can do its
projection so sometimes you're like I'm

328
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
projection so sometimes you're like I'm
 

329
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,590
projection so sometimes you're like I'm
stopping you you see you feel that this

330
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:10,600
stopping you you see you feel that this
 

331
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,509
stopping you you see you feel that this
one's yielding but that one's stopping

332
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:12,519
one's yielding but that one's stopping
 

333
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,910
one's yielding but that one's stopping
you and then you can't ever get there

334
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:14,920
