9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,070
pull there's no push pulling ikea
um there's adhesion or projection

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
um there's adhesion or projection

okay
 

15
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,109
okay
and then he's going to give some energy

16
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
and then he's going to give some energy
 

17
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:23,830
and then he's going to give some energy
okay

18
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
okay
 

19
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,230
okay
and i want to make sure that it goes in

20
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
and i want to make sure that it goes in
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,750
and i want to make sure that it goes in
his in his center

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
his in his center
 

23
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,310
his in his center
you see that so i don't wanna just pull

24
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
you see that so i don't wanna just pull
 

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,950
you see that so i don't wanna just pull
you

26
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
you
 

27
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,750
you
okay so i'm projecting you see that

28
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
okay so i'm projecting you see that
 

29
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,910
okay so i'm projecting you see that
it'll affect his cesar like that

30
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
it'll affect his cesar like that
 

31
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,150
it'll affect his cesar like that
okay there he goes it'll affect his

32
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
okay there he goes it'll affect his
 

33
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,630
okay there he goes it'll affect his
stays up

34
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
stays up
 

35
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,310
stays up
uh this this is different

36
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
uh this this is different
 

37
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,150
uh this this is different
i am sending it back into his cesar

38
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
i am sending it back into his cesar
 

39
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,029
i am sending it back into his cesar
position

40
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
position
 

41
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,510
position
i'm really exaggerating that part you

42
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
i'm really exaggerating that part you
 

43
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,069
i'm really exaggerating that part you
see

44
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
see
 

45
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,350
see
i'm not just leaning and then he tilts

46
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
i'm not just leaning and then he tilts
 

47
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,709
i'm not just leaning and then he tilts
i'm i am displacing his seizure making

48
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
i'm i am displacing his seizure making
 

49
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,750
i'm i am displacing his seizure making
his hips

50
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
his hips
 

51
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,790
his hips
slide off of his body so he's

52
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
slide off of his body so he's
 

53
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,509
slide off of his body so he's
doing this over and over okay there he

54
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
doing this over and over okay there he
 

55
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,109
doing this over and over okay there he
goes

56
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
goes
 

57
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,670
goes
just doing it he comes up

58
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680

 

59
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,190

i want to understand uh how to connect

60
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
i want to understand uh how to connect
 

61
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,789
i want to understand uh how to connect
to his center

62
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
to his center
 

63
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,990
to his center
okay and it doesn't matter if you do the

64
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
okay and it doesn't matter if you do the
 

65
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,670
okay and it doesn't matter if you do the
same one over and over you're still

66
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
same one over and over you're still
 

67
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,590
same one over and over you're still
feeling it

68
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600

 

69
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,830

okay and then he goes

70
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
okay and then he goes
 

71
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,390
okay and then he goes
there you go

72
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400

 

73
00:01:36,400 --> 00:02:02,469

find it you gotta do the connection good

74
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479

 

75
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,630

okay okay

76
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640

 

77
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,309

okay in this drill

78
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319

 

79
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,710

i know you have the kazushi patterns

80
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
i know you have the kazushi patterns
 

81
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,910
i know you have the kazushi patterns
okay so yes

82
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
okay so yes
 

83
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,710
okay so yes
and that is the most efficient way but

84
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
and that is the most efficient way but
 

85
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,869
and that is the most efficient way but
i'm not doing that in this drill so if

86
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
i'm not doing that in this drill so if
 

87
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,229
i'm not doing that in this drill so if
you pay attention

88
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
you pay attention
 

89
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,030
you pay attention
he goes he doesn't come forward you see

90
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
he goes he doesn't come forward you see
 

91
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,070
he goes he doesn't come forward you see
and he comes

92
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
and he comes
 

93
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,390
and he comes
up extends his upper leg he's on his

94
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
up extends his upper leg he's on his
 

95
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,350
up extends his upper leg he's on his
knee he

96
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
knee he
 

97
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,070
knee he
he's right he never comes out of the

98
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
he's right he never comes out of the
 

99
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,869
he's right he never comes out of the
seizure

100
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
seizure
 

101
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,830
seizure
okay so even though i'm yielding i'm

102
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
okay so even though i'm yielding i'm
 

103
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,550
okay so even though i'm yielding i'm
just

104
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
just
 

105
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,589
just
keeping him in the seizure so this goes

106
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
keeping him in the seizure so this goes
 

107
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,790
keeping him in the seizure so this goes
into his stance they're not like this

108
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
into his stance they're not like this
 

109
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,390
into his stance they're not like this
and then

110
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400

 

111
00:02:44,400 --> 00:03:16,830

here yield one

112

take his
energy and i have it set up uh

126
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
energy and i have it set up uh
 

127
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,869
energy and i have it set up uh
the coq projection so i

128
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
the coq projection so i
 

129
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,509

active cooking i more use the i
 

151
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,110
active cooking i more use the i
key to set up your you see

152
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
key to set up your you see
 

153
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,390
key to set up your you see
i i'm i'm bridge i am using the i key to

154
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
i i'm i'm bridge i am using the i key to
 

155
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,589
i i'm i'm bridge i am using the i key to
load my co cube

156
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
load my co cube
 

157
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,190
load my co cube
can you see that so here is the

158
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
can you see that so here is the
 

159

can you see that so here is the
difference so here's

160
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
difference so here's
 

161
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,350
difference so here's
here is the i key do you see and then

162
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
here is the i key do you see and then
 

163
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,830
here is the i key do you see and then
and here is the active

164
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
and here is the active
 

165
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,830
and here is the active
you see that what i'm going to do you

166
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
you see that what i'm going to do you
 

167
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,590
you see that what i'm going to do you
push right

168
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
push right
 

169
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,110
push right
see that's that's where i want to be

170
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
see that's that's where i want to be
 

171
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,350
see that's that's where i want to be
okay and that's very difficult to do

172

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
so i'm just doing these energy keep an
 

193
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,710
so i'm just doing these energy keep an
energy drill

194
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720

 

195
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,510

and uh part of the training is as we

196
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
and uh part of the training is as we
 

197
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,749
and uh part of the training is as we

um a lot of times you'll have contagion
 

201
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,830
um a lot of times you'll have contagion
so you feel be relaxed and then you

202
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840

268
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
get the kazushi pattern i'm just
 

269
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,990
get the kazushi pattern i'm just
interested in your base displacement

270
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
interested in your base displacement
 

271
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,950
interested in your base displacement
face displacement

and it's not a matter of just pushing
 

275
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,629
and it's not a matter of just pushing
back

276
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
back
 

277
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:10,830
back
all right look here forward

278
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
