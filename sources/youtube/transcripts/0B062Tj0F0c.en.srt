00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,990
so
you're now in a different context

178
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
you're now in a different context
 

179
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,670
you're now in a different context
you're going to have to

180
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
you're going to have to
 

181
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,030
you're going to have to
be able to navigate this context okay

182
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
be able to navigate this context okay
 

183
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,030
be able to navigate this context okay
so in order to learn how to navigate the

184
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
so in order to learn how to navigate the
 

185
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,429
so in order to learn how to navigate the
context in terms of defense i have to

186
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
context in terms of defense i have to
 

187
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,589
context in terms of defense i have to
know how to do the context so i can

188
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
know how to do the context so i can
 

189
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,949
know how to do the context so i can
train him and he can train me okay

190
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
train him and he can train me okay
 

191
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,429
train him and he can train me okay
so the one we're looking for

192
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
so the one we're looking for
 

193
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,550
so the one we're looking for
today

194
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
today
 

195
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,509
today
is attacking the closest target to me

196
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
is attacking the closest target to me
 

197
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,509
is attacking the closest target to me
that's the leg

198
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
that's the leg
 

199
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,430
that's the leg
i'm going to use that as my bridging

200
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
i'm going to use that as my bridging
 

201
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,710
i'm going to use that as my bridging
okay

202
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
okay
 

203
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,550
okay
so when i bridge my goal is to get back

204
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
so when i bridge my goal is to get back
 

205
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,510
so when i bridge my goal is to get back
to asocial violence it is not

206
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
to asocial violence it is not
 

207
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,150
to asocial violence it is not
to pepper him and come out i'm not here

208
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
to pepper him and come out i'm not here
 

209
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,550
to pepper him and come out i'm not here
to win this thing in terms of points i'm

210
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
to win this thing in terms of points i'm
 

211
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,830
to win this thing in terms of points i'm
here to kill him or defeat him that's

212
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
here to kill him or defeat him that's
 

213
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,430
here to kill him or defeat him that's
what i'm here for

214
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
what i'm here for
 

215
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,590
what i'm here for
so it makes no sense to throw this light

216
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
so it makes no sense to throw this light
 

217
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,749
so it makes no sense to throw this light
it makes no sense to throw it in a way

218
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
it makes no sense to throw it in a way
 

219
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,030
it makes no sense to throw it in a way
that i can't counter continue my attack

220
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040

 

221
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,790

and when i throw the attack it's not a

222
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
and when i throw the attack it's not a
 

223
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,790
and when i throw the attack it's not a
whole other different kind of technique

224
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
whole other different kind of technique
 

225
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,909
whole other different kind of technique
so for example here i am in kihon he's

226
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
so for example here i am in kihon he's
 

227
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,749
so for example here i am in kihon he's
pushing and that energy is being

228
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
pushing and that energy is being
 

229
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,830
pushing and that energy is being
grounded and that's the energy that i

230
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
grounded and that's the energy that i
 

231
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,670
grounded and that's the energy that i
project out

232
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
project out
 

233
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,950
project out
same thing on the throw who won't pop

234
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
same thing on the throw who won't pop
 

235
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,430
same thing on the throw who won't pop
i take his resistance of his mass into

236
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
i take his resistance of his mass into
 

237
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,670
i take his resistance of his mass into
the foot

238
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
the foot
 

239
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,510
the foot
so don't start

240
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
so don't start
 

241
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,909
so don't start
changing arcs

242
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
changing arcs
 

243
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,070
changing arcs
same way i do those throws

244
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
same way i do those throws
 

245
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,029
same way i do those throws
it's the same way i take this energy

246
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
it's the same way i take this energy
 

247
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,150
it's the same way i take this energy
here let go and i do the same thing

248
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
here let go and i do the same thing
 

249
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,909
here let go and i do the same thing
on his chest foot boom

250
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
on his chest foot boom
 

251
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,790
on his chest foot boom
is the same way i throw my hand

252
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
is the same way i throw my hand
 

253
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,390
is the same way i throw my hand
it's in this foot

254
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
it's in this foot
 

255
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,749
it's in this foot
i'm not here

256
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
i'm not here
 

257
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,670
i'm not here
and relying on different engines like

258
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
and relying on different engines like
 

259
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,469
and relying on different engines like
hip rotation it goes in the foot

260
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
hip rotation it goes in the foot
 

261
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,469
hip rotation it goes in the foot
so you're going to feel

262
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
so you're going to feel
 

263
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,870
so you're going to feel
your energy your mass grounded you're

264
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
your energy your mass grounded you're
 

265
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,950
your energy your mass grounded you're
going to feel his energy his past keep

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
going to feel his energy his past keep
 

267
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,350
going to feel his energy his past keep
it grounded

268
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
it grounded
 

269
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,830
it grounded
so you're not here

270
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
so you're not here
 

271
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,629
so you're not here
coming up on your heel

272
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
coming up on your heel
 

273
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,909
coming up on your heel
this energy goes through boom

274
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919

 

275
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,990

boom

276
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000

 

277
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,309

so i'm not kicking them hard but i i

278
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
so i'm not kicking them hard but i i
 

279
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,469
so i'm not kicking them hard but i i
want to feel the resistance of his mass

280
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
want to feel the resistance of his mass
 

281
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,510
want to feel the resistance of his mass
the target and that

282
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
the target and that
 

283
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,830
the target and that
goes into the ground

284
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840

 

285
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:28,230

and now i'm in the back

286
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240

 

287
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,150

if you want

288
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
if you want
 

289
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:39,780
if you want
take your body

290
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:39,790

go

298
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
go
 

299
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,189
go
okay so i want to repeat the point

300
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
okay so i want to repeat the point
 

301
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,309
okay so i want to repeat the point
in aikido it's always internal it's

302
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
in aikido it's always internal it's
 

303
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
in aikido it's always internal it's
always internal which means energy goes

304
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
always internal which means energy goes
 

305
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,830
always internal which means energy goes
through my body that's what makes it

306
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
through my body that's what makes it
 

307
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,790
through my body that's what makes it
internal and i project it onto a greater

308
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
internal and i project it onto a greater
 

309
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,029
internal and i project it onto a greater
mass there's a rebound and that's what i

310
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
mass there's a rebound and that's what i
 

311
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,230
mass there's a rebound and that's what i
use to displace his mass with okay the

312
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
use to displace his mass with okay the
 

313
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,029
use to displace his mass with okay the
rebounding energy

314
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
rebounding energy
 

315
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,029
rebounding energy
so

316
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
so
 

317
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,950
so
i i don't want to start going

318
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960

 

319
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,950

like that's a kind of energy you see i

320
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
like that's a kind of energy you see i
 

321
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,870
like that's a kind of energy you see i
have a gravitational

322
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
have a gravitational
 

323
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,550
have a gravitational
drop

324
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
drop
 

325
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,270
drop
i also don't want to go back to

326
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
i also don't want to go back to
 

327
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,510
i also don't want to go back to
just my hip rotation

328
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
just my hip rotation
 

329
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,990
just my hip rotation
that's not what i'm doing

330
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
that's not what i'm doing
 

331
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,950
that's not what i'm doing
i'm going to send all my energy my

332
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
i'm going to send all my energy my
 

333
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,189
i'm going to send all my energy my
moving energy my gravitational pull of

334
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
moving energy my gravitational pull of
 

335
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,270
moving energy my gravitational pull of
my mass into that foot

336
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
my mass into that foot
 

337
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,909
my mass into that foot
the same way yes it's fast but that's

338
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
the same way yes it's fast but that's
 

339
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,150
the same way yes it's fast but that's
the skill it doesn't require time you're

340
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
the skill it doesn't require time you're
 

341
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,909
the skill it doesn't require time you're
not doing it if you need a lot of time

342
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
not doing it if you need a lot of time
 

343
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,430
not doing it if you need a lot of time
to get it set up

344
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
to get it set up
 

345
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,070
to get it set up
when i hit that's now energy that goes

346
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
when i hit that's now energy that goes
 

347
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,430
when i hit that's now energy that goes
into that foot

348
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
into that foot
 

349
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,909
into that foot
and that's what allows the displacement

350
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
and that's what allows the displacement
 

351
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,749
and that's what allows the displacement
so i do the kick

352
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
so i do the kick
 

353
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,550
so i do the kick
and

354
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
and
 

355
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,150
and
i'm going to kick through

356
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
i'm going to kick through
 

357
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,270
i'm going to kick through
i want i don't want that leg to be there

358
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
i want i don't want that leg to be there
 

359
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,550
i want i don't want that leg to be there
into this foot is where i'm

360
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
into this foot is where i'm
 

361
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,950
into this foot is where i'm
concentrating

362
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
concentrating
 

363
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,430
concentrating
so he's back off the bag

364
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
so he's back off the bag
 

365
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,909
so he's back off the bag
and i can't sit here and kick him all

366
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
and i can't sit here and kick him all
 

367
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,110
and i can't sit here and kick him all
day long

368
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
day long
 

369
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,550
day long
so i'm going to slow it down which is

370
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
so i'm going to slow it down which is
 

371
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,150
so i'm going to slow it down which is
possible

372
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
possible
 

373
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,990
possible
we'll displace

374
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
we'll displace
 

375
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,390
we'll displace
here

376
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400

 

377
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,230

what i'm looking for

378
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
what i'm looking for
 

379
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,830
what i'm looking for
is that tilt

380
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
is that tilt
 

381
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,950
is that tilt
that's the same tilt you set up so

382
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
that's the same tilt you set up so
 

383
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,629
that's the same tilt you set up so
we did this technique there's the tilt

384
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
we did this technique there's the tilt
 

385
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,430
we did this technique there's the tilt
right there we came in

386
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
right there we came in
 

387
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,390
right there we came in
that's what makes the base attackable

388
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
that's what makes the base attackable
 

389
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,340
that's what makes the base attackable
so boom engine oh break it

390
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,350

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
energy passes through me you have to
 

691
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,350
energy passes through me you have to
understand that i must become

692
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
understand that i must become
 

693
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,710
understand that i must become
a vessel i must become empty the energy

694
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
a vessel i must become empty the energy
 

695
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,310
a vessel i must become empty the energy
passes through me this is the heart

696
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
passes through me this is the heart
 

697
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,389
passes through me this is the heart
of non-contestation

698
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399

 

699
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,470

so he pushes and you move it out of the

700
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
so he pushes and you move it out of the
 

701
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,910
so he pushes and you move it out of the
way is not it is a non-contestation but

702
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
way is not it is a non-contestation but
 

703
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,509
way is not it is a non-contestation but
it's not really the heart of

704
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
it's not really the heart of
 

705
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,509
it's not really the heart of
non-contestation

706
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
non-contestation
 

707
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,910
non-contestation
the heart of non-contestation is this

708
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
the heart of non-contestation is this
 

709
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,069
the heart of non-contestation is this
energy is going through me it's going to

710
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
energy is going through me it's going to
 

711
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,949
energy is going through me it's going to
the ground my arm can stay at apparently

712
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
the ground my arm can stay at apparently
 

713
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,389
the ground my arm can stay at apparently
weird angles do you see weird angles my

714
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
weird angles do you see weird angles my
 

715
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,949
weird angles do you see weird angles my
arm can stay at weird angles this this i

716
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
arm can stay at weird angles this this i
 

717
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,189
arm can stay at weird angles this this i
try to do this externally won't work but

718
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
try to do this externally won't work but
 

719
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,150
try to do this externally won't work but
if i just let that energy push into me

720
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
if i just let that energy push into me
 

721
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,310
if i just let that energy push into me
the right angle is fine and you can come

722
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
the right angle is fine and you can come
 

723
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,389
the right angle is fine and you can come
back from it just keep pushing

724
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
back from it just keep pushing
 

725
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,710
back from it just keep pushing
into the ground you see so he's not

726
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
into the ground you see so he's not
 

727
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,509
into the ground you see so he's not
really pushing into the lever

728
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
really pushing into the lever
 

729
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,470
really pushing into the lever
and so i don't really over strain

730
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
and so i don't really over strain
 

731
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,310
and so i don't really over strain
the inner deltoid and it becomes

732
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
the inner deltoid and it becomes
 

733
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,670
the inner deltoid and it becomes
possible

734
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680

 

735
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,110

that's non-contestation

736
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120

 

737
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,150

so

738
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
so
 

739
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,310
so
the energy must pass through me to do

740
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
the energy must pass through me to do
 

741
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,550
the energy must pass through me to do
that i must become an empty vessel and

742
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
that i must become an empty vessel and
 

743
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,749
that i must become an empty vessel and
that is the overlap between the physical

744
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
that is the overlap between the physical
 

745
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,150
that is the overlap between the physical
techniques and the spiritual techniques

746
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
techniques and the spiritual techniques
 

747
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,150
techniques and the spiritual techniques
because in the same way that energy is

748
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
because in the same way that energy is
 

749
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,590
because in the same way that energy is
passing through me

750
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
passing through me
 

751
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,790
passing through me
due to my emptying of self

752
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
due to my emptying of self
 

753
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,670
due to my emptying of self
this opens the door for

754
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
this opens the door for
 

755
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,829
this opens the door for
what various mystical traditions we'll

756
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
what various mystical traditions we'll
 

757
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,629
what various mystical traditions we'll
call the divine god grace

758
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
call the divine god grace
 

759
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,590
call the divine god grace
what we moderns micah well now there's

760
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
what we moderns micah well now there's
 

761
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,749
what we moderns micah well now there's
no more subject there's no more object

762
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
no more subject there's no more object
 

763
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,670
no more subject there's no more object
you're in the mystical experience at a

764
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
you're in the mystical experience at a
 

765
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,990
you're in the mystical experience at a
physiological level because there's no

766
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
physiological level because there's no
 

767
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,310
physiological level because there's no
separation of body mind

768
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
separation of body mind
 

769
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,710
separation of body mind
they're the same

770
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
they're the same
 

771
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,749
they're the same
so i wouldn't get caught up in all the

772
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
so i wouldn't get caught up in all the
 

773
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,189
so i wouldn't get caught up in all the
different

774
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
different
 

775
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,789
different
qi or all the different gene or

776
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
qi or all the different gene or
 

777
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,270
qi or all the different gene or
all the yin yang correspondences as you

778
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
all the yin yang correspondences as you
 

779
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,350
all the yin yang correspondences as you
look at the internal arts

780
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
look at the internal arts
 

781
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,150
look at the internal arts
so

782
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
so
 

783
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,110
so
you're looking for this emptying of self

784
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
you're looking for this emptying of self
 

785
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,230
you're looking for this emptying of self
that means his energy goes through me

786
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
that means his energy goes through me
 

787
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,949
that means his energy goes through me
to use it martially

788
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
to use it martially
 

789
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,429
to use it martially
his energy goes through me

790
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
his energy goes through me
 

791
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,029
his energy goes through me
and i redirect it internally into a

792
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
and i redirect it internally into a
 

793
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,710
and i redirect it internally into a
greater mass

794
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
greater mass
 

795
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,630
greater mass
than the property of the greater mass

796
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
than the property of the greater mass
 

797
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,990
than the property of the greater mass
which is often the planet

798
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
which is often the planet
 

799
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,390
which is often the planet
is going to displace the energy that i

800
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
is going to displace the energy that i
 

801
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,230
is going to displace the energy that i
sent down because it's greater mass so

802
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
sent down because it's greater mass so
 

803
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,430
sent down because it's greater mass so
it will reflect it or rebound it

804
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
it will reflect it or rebound it
 

805
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,230
it will reflect it or rebound it
back into my person because i'm empty

806
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
back into my person because i'm empty
 

807
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,789
back into my person because i'm empty
it'll go back into my person

808
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
it'll go back into my person
 

809
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,870
it'll go back into my person
and then i can aim it

810
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
and then i can aim it
 

811
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,390
and then i can aim it
and do different things with it but

812
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
and do different things with it but
 

813
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,510
and do different things with it but
whose energy was it it was his energy

814
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
whose energy was it it was his energy
 

815
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,750
whose energy was it it was his energy
going through me hitting a greater mass

816
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
going through me hitting a greater mass
 

817
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,270
going through me hitting a greater mass
it's that same energy

818
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280

 

819
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,830

but it's not just his energy there's

820
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
but it's not just his energy there's
 

821
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,470
but it's not just his energy there's
also the energy of my mass the

822
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
also the energy of my mass the
 

823
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,870
also the energy of my mass the
gravitational pull on my mass the

824
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
gravitational pull on my mass the
 

825
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,190
gravitational pull on my mass the
movement of my mass through space all

826
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
movement of my mass through space all
 

827
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,270
movement of my mass through space all
that has to

828
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
that has to
 

829
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,390
that has to
pass through me to the greater mass to

830
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
pass through me to the greater mass to
 

831
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,630
pass through me to the greater mass to
get the reflection or the deflection or

832
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
get the reflection or the deflection or
 

833
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,230
get the reflection or the deflection or
the rebound

834
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
the rebound
 

835
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,870
the rebound
so if i'm doing this drill

836
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
so if i'm doing this drill
 

837
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,630
so if i'm doing this drill

i am just going to static make it go

840
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
i am just going to static make it go
 

841
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,710
i am just going to static make it go
down down

842
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
down down
 

843
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,110
down down
let's begin our beginner level learn to

844
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
let's begin our beginner level learn to
 

845
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,630
let's begin our beginner level learn to
empty yourself

846
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
empty yourself
 

847
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,350
empty yourself
and let it go down to the ground

848
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
and let it go down to the ground
 

849
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,390
and let it go down to the ground
then what i do is okay well it went down

850
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
then what i do is okay well it went down
 

851
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,549
then what i do is okay well it went down
now get the rebounding energy and learn

852
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
now get the rebounding energy and learn
 

853
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,870
now get the rebounding energy and learn
to let it back up you let that energy

854
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
to let it back up you let that energy
 

855
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,070
to let it back up you let that energy
back in let it come back out so we'll

856
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
back in let it come back out so we'll
 

857
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,150
back in let it come back out so we'll
pop

858
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
pop
 

859
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,950
pop
pull

860
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
pull
 

861
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,029
pull
and the harder it pushes boom the more

862
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
and the harder it pushes boom the more
 

863
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,270
and the harder it pushes boom the more
immediate the effect the energy goes it

864
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
immediate the effect the energy goes it
 

865
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,270
immediate the effect the energy goes it
goes boom it's greater and faster okay

866
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
goes boom it's greater and faster okay
 

867
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,390
goes boom it's greater and faster okay
well

868
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
well
 

869
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,909
well
that same energy can be done

870
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
that same energy can be done
 

871
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,190
that same energy can be done
in this case it's in a pushing way

872
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
in this case it's in a pushing way
 

873
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,909
in this case it's in a pushing way
that same energy can be done

874
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
that same energy can be done
 

875
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,110
that same energy can be done
in coming back towards me so here's his

876
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
in coming back towards me so here's his
 

877
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,950
in coming back towards me so here's his
mass

878
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
mass
 

879
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,909
mass
and

880
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
and
 

881
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,270
and
as i try to pull him forward

882
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
as i try to pull him forward
 

883
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,070
as i try to pull him forward
that's more gravity against me well i

884
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
that's more gravity against me well i
 

885
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,310
that's more gravity against me well i
send that down to the ground and you can

886
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
send that down to the ground and you can
 

887
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,390
send that down to the ground and you can
get

888
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
get
 

889
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,549
get
that side of the equation

890
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
that side of the equation
 

891
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,029
that side of the equation
so for simplicity state i don't give it

892
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
so for simplicity state i don't give it
 

893
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,950
so for simplicity state i don't give it
all the different gins that the internal

894
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
all the different gins that the internal
 

895
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,830
all the different gins that the internal
arts would give it this one who is

896
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
arts would give it this one who is
 

897
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,950
arts would give it this one who is
called cube and this one

898
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960

 

899
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,630

energy that is

900
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
energy that is
 

901
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,750
energy that is
is coq and the energy that adheres from

902
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
is coq and the energy that adheres from
 

903
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,470
is coq and the energy that adheres from
communes is ikey do you understand

904
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480

 

905
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,190

this here is a drill though

906
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
this here is a drill though
 

907
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,029
this here is a drill though
clearly it's a drill because partially

908
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
clearly it's a drill because partially
 

909
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,710
clearly it's a drill because partially
no one should be grabbing me and i don't

910
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
no one should be grabbing me and i don't
 

911
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,549
no one should be grabbing me and i don't
know why i'm sitting here so if you

912
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
know why i'm sitting here so if you
 

913
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,270
know why i'm sitting here so if you
don't understand drilling

914
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
don't understand drilling
 

915
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,789
don't understand drilling
and you think to some

916
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
and you think to some
 

917
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,789
and you think to some
martial context you're lost you're not

918
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
martial context you're lost you're not
 

919
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,390
martial context you're lost you're not
going to get it

920
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400

 

921
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,590

so here so far

922
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
so here so far
 

923
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,870
so here so far
i have a kit

924
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
i have a kit
 

925
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,710
i have a kit
and i have a bridging technique you see

926
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
and i have a bridging technique you see
 

927
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,789
and i have a bridging technique you see
i'm leaving the drilling rule and i'm

928
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
i'm leaving the drilling rule and i'm
 

929
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,549
i'm leaving the drilling rule and i'm
starting to enter application you see

930
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
starting to enter application you see
 

931
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,870
starting to enter application you see
that okay

932
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
that okay
 

933
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,710
that okay
i don't want to change the engines that

934
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
i don't want to change the engines that
 

935
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190
i don't want to change the engines that
i use you understand okay so i'm not

936
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
i use you understand okay so i'm not
 

937
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,230
i use you understand okay so i'm not
going to go to hip rotation just like

938
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
going to go to hip rotation just like
 

939
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,870
going to go to hip rotation just like
i'm not going to go to uh here i'm not

940
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
i'm not going to go to uh here i'm not
 

941
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,590
i'm not going to go to uh here i'm not
going to go to hip rotation here

942
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
going to go to hip rotation here
 

943
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,990
going to go to hip rotation here
that's not what i'm doing

944
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000

 

945
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,789

this mass is being pushed down

946
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
this mass is being pushed down
 

947
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,669
this mass is being pushed down
my mass is being pushed down

948
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
my mass is being pushed down
 

949
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,230
my mass is being pushed down
my mass is moving

950
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
my mass is moving
 

951
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,789
my mass is moving
all that is energy all that energy goes

952
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
all that is energy all that energy goes
 

953
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,830
all that is energy all that energy goes
into the ground vector which means so it

954
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
into the ground vector which means so it
 

955
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,830
into the ground vector which means so it
can rebound off the greater mass of the

956
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
can rebound off the greater mass of the
 

957
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,630
can rebound off the greater mass of the
planet you understand okay

958
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
planet you understand okay
 

959
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,470
planet you understand okay
when i do this

960
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
when i do this
 

961
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,830
when i do this
in drilling it's done slowly you see

962
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
in drilling it's done slowly you see
 

963
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,669
in drilling it's done slowly you see
it's done slowly

964
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
it's done slowly
 

965
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,350
it's done slowly
for the purposes

966
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
for the purposes
 

967
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,950
for the purposes
of prolonging the cultivation field

968
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
of prolonging the cultivation field
 

969
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,470
of prolonging the cultivation field
but if you think you're going to have

970
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
but if you think you're going to have
 

971
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,870
but if you think you're going to have
that much time in application you're

972
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
that much time in application you're
 

973
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,870
that much time in application you're
crazy you're dreaming okay

974
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
crazy you're dreaming okay
 

975
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,149
crazy you're dreaming okay
which means i need to be able to do it

976
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
which means i need to be able to do it
 

977
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,909
which means i need to be able to do it
quickly like

978
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
quickly like
 

979
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,590
quickly like
all this energy whoa all that mass

980
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
all this energy whoa all that mass
 

981
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,149
all this energy whoa all that mass
that's got to go into that foot not like

982
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
that's got to go into that foot not like
 

983
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,390
that's got to go into that foot not like
this

984
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
this
 

985
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,750
this
do you see

986
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
do you see
 

987
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,990
do you see
it's got to be quick

988
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000

 

989
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,110

quick

990
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120

 

991
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,789

not here

992
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799

 

993
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,390

same thing on the kick

994
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
same thing on the kick
 

995
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,350
same thing on the kick
it can't be i'm not using hip rotation

996
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
it can't be i'm not using hip rotation
 

997
00:21:49,360 --> 00:22:16,040
it can't be i'm not using hip rotation
i'm going to use this

998
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,050

 

999
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,029

now this brings up something else

1002
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
now this brings up something else
 

1003
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,710
now this brings up something else
my dynamic

1004
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
my dynamic
 

1005
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,190
my dynamic
i have the time space

1006
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
i have the time space
 

1007
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,110
i have the time space
for the kick

1008
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
for the kick
 

1009
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,669
for the kick
and i have the time space

1010
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
and i have the time space
 

1011
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,710
and i have the time space
for the body locking me

1012
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720

 

1013
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,590

too far

1014
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600

 

1015
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,149

too out

1016
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
too out
 

1017
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,909
too out
in

1018
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
in
 

1019
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,510
in
too far in

1020
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520

 

1021
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,549

so

1022
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
so
 

1023
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,710
so
he's a little more dynamic now

1024
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
he's a little more dynamic now
 

1025
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,510
he's a little more dynamic now
i move boom

1026
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
i move boom
 

1027
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,549
i move boom
right now boom same thing

1028
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559

 

1029
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,110

doesn't mean i'm contesting equally just
 

1203
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,029
doesn't mean i'm contesting equally just
because i'm far

1204
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
because i'm far
 

1205
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,389
because i'm far
does not mean i'm not contesting

1206
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:51,399
does not mean i'm not contesting
 

1207
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:57,350
does not mean i'm not contesting
non-contestation is an internal aspect

i have this body
 

1267
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,190
i have this body
back you need me

1268
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
back you need me
 

1269
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,269
back you need me
you're trying to do your knees okay

1270
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
you're trying to do your knees okay
 

1271
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,350
you're trying to do your knees okay
and now i go into the in space

1272
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
and now i go into the in space
 

1273
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,470
and now i go into the in space
but that initial energy

1274
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
but that initial energy
 

1275
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,549
but that initial energy
is what i'm going to project

1276
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
is what i'm going to project
 

1277
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,870
is what i'm going to project
on whatever foot i find

1278
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
on whatever foot i find
 

1279
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,950
on whatever foot i find
often in your keyhole it's the back foot

1280
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
often in your keyhole it's the back foot
 

1281
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,190
often in your keyhole it's the back foot
but in fighting it's whatever is in

1282
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
but in fighting it's whatever is in
 

1283
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,950
but in fighting it's whatever is in
contact with the greater mass okay so

1284
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
contact with the greater mass okay so
 

1285
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,230
contact with the greater mass okay so
i go

1286
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
i go
 

1287
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,389
i go
it might be the back foot

1288
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399

 

1289
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,710

but depending on what's happening

1290
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
but depending on what's happening
 

1291
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,549
but depending on what's happening
it might be the front foot so i'm on

1292
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
it might be the front foot so i'm on
 

1293
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,549
it might be the front foot so i'm on
this foot push

1294
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
this foot push
 

1295
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,350
this foot push
push

1296
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
push
 

1297
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,950
push
i'm on this foot

1298
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
i'm on this foot
 

1299
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,950
i'm on this foot
and that might be the one

1300
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960

 

1301
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,269

that i end up doing okay you're all just

1302
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
that i end up doing okay you're all just
 

1303
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,870
that i end up doing okay you're all just
letting it go through you and finding

1304
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
letting it go through you and finding
 

1305
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,710
letting it go through you and finding
the greater mass

1306
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
the greater mass
 

1307
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,710
the greater mass
so

1308
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
so
 

1309
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,070
so
boom push push push push push push i

1310
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
boom push push push push push push i
 

1311
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,230
boom push push push push push push i
yield i load that energy

1312
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
yield i load that energy
 

1313
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,789
yield i load that energy
and this is a cokey projection

1314
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
and this is a cokey projection
 

1315
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,950
and this is a cokey projection
it's not a momentum throat coq

1316
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
it's not a momentum throat coq
