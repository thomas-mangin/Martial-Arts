00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,510

okay so he's he's got his hair maker

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
okay so he's he's got his hair maker
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,630
okay so he's he's got his hair maker
okay he's way bigger than me so i'm not

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
okay he's way bigger than me so i'm not
 

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,510
okay he's way bigger than me so i'm not
gonna sit here

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
gonna sit here
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,950
gonna sit here
and try to stop this thing okay so

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
and try to stop this thing okay so
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,509
and try to stop this thing okay so
i have to use my jiu-jitsu so my hand

10
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
i have to use my jiu-jitsu so my hand
 

11
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,870
i have to use my jiu-jitsu so my hand
does go up

12
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
does go up
 

13
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,950
does go up
but you're going to feel that pressure

14
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
but you're going to feel that pressure
 

15
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,470
but you're going to feel that pressure
and you're going to move inside of

16
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
and you're going to move inside of
 

17
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,029
and you're going to move inside of
it okay and then you're going to find

18
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
it okay and then you're going to find
 

19
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,070
it okay and then you're going to find
the inside

20
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080

 

21
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,589

that's your distance to get out of

22
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
that's your distance to get out of
 

23
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,390
that's your distance to get out of
weapon retention issue range okay so the

24
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
weapon retention issue range okay so the
 

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,870
weapon retention issue range okay so the
arm

26
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
arm
 

27
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,430
arm
the arm does make contact but then it

28
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
the arm does make contact but then it
 

29
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,350
the arm does make contact but then it
heals and comes around and drops the

30
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
heals and comes around and drops the
 

31
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,389
heals and comes around and drops the
elbow on the outside

32
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
elbow on the outside
 

33
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,150
elbow on the outside
so don't have no contact

34
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
so don't have no contact
 

35
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,350
so don't have no contact
but don't brace on this thing either

36
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
but don't brace on this thing either
 

37
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,470
but don't brace on this thing either
so boom

38
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480

 

39
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,750

and you're moving inside so you need the

40
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
and you're moving inside so you need the
 

41
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:10,710
and you're moving inside so you need the
other honda

42
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720

 

43
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,830

so uh you can't keep turning in on this

44
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
so uh you can't keep turning in on this
 

45
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,109
so uh you can't keep turning in on this
because you won't get the

46
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
because you won't get the
 

47
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,230
because you won't get the
projection angle all right so you have

48
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
projection angle all right so you have
 

49
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,429
projection angle all right so you have
to take a lace

50
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
to take a lace
 

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,950
to take a lace
foam and you can get it so

52
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
foam and you can get it so
 

53
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,830
foam and you can get it so
you only move in inside of that circle

54
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
you only move in inside of that circle
 

55
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,630
you only move in inside of that circle
okay

56
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
okay
 

57
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,030
okay
and then that's it

58
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040

 

59
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,230

good so

60
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
good so
 

61
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,350
good so
inside

62
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360

 

63
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:47,910

watch that you don't keep turning

64
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920

 

65
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,190

you want to understand

66
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200

 

67
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,109

why you're doing one thing and it's got

68
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
why you're doing one thing and it's got
 

69
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,109
why you're doing one thing and it's got
to be because i can't do something else

70
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
to be because i can't do something else
 

71
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,990
to be because i can't do something else
okay that's how you get a tactical sense

72
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
okay that's how you get a tactical sense
 

73
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,950
okay that's how you get a tactical sense
all right

74
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
all right
 

75
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,830
all right
so if if if he takes his final stance

76
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
so if if if he takes his final stance
 

77
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,830
so if if if he takes his final stance
out here

78
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
out here
 

79
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,710
out here
you see so that means this can't be uh

80
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
you see so that means this can't be uh
 

81
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,029
you see so that means this can't be uh
where this technique would be viable you

82
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
where this technique would be viable you
 

83
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,150
where this technique would be viable you
see if he takes his stance out here

84
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
see if he takes his stance out here
 

85
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,470
see if he takes his stance out here
i would do something like that right or

86
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
i would do something like that right or
 

87
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,830
i would do something like that right or
get my baton out

88
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
get my baton out
 

89
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,150
get my baton out
so it's gotta be more like interviews

90
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
so it's gotta be more like interviews
 

91
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,229
so it's gotta be more like interviews
it's more of an ambush situation

92
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
it's more of an ambush situation
 

93
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,110
it's more of an ambush situation
okay so if it's an ambush situation and

94
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
okay so if it's an ambush situation and
 

95
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,949
okay so if it's an ambush situation and
he goes to throw his strike that's why i

96
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
he goes to throw his strike that's why i
 

97
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,470
he goes to throw his strike that's why i
got to defend the strike i'm not going

98
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
got to defend the strike i'm not going
 

99
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,229
got to defend the strike i'm not going
to drop my weapons

100
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
to drop my weapons
 

101
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,750
to drop my weapons
but i don't have the time to do this big

102
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
but i don't have the time to do this big
 

103
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,270
but i don't have the time to do this big
deviation

104
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
deviation
 

105
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,910
deviation
because if i take space i require time

106
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
because if i take space i require time
 

107
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,910
because if i take space i require time
and time's not practical here

108
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
and time's not practical here
 

109
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,309
and time's not practical here
so my deviation is inside

110
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319

 

111
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,790

inside just get get your head get your

112
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
inside just get get your head get your
 

113
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,830
inside just get get your head get your
head

114
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
head
 

115
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,630
head
off you get it that's all you're doing

116
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640

 

117
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470

so you know another strategy you could

118
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
so you know another strategy you could
 

119
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,229
so you know another strategy you could
do you're in here but

120
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
do you're in here but
 

121
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,670
do you're in here but
he's bigger than me so i don't want to

122
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
he's bigger than me so i don't want to
 

123
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,430
he's bigger than me so i don't want to
grapple him okay

124
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
grapple him okay
 

125
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,949
grapple him okay
so if i

126
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
so if i
 

127
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,949
so if i
that's that's the technique so try not

128
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
that's that's the technique so try not
 

129
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,790
that's that's the technique so try not
to move your feet so much okay

130
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
to move your feet so much okay
 

131
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,159
to move your feet so much okay
start close
