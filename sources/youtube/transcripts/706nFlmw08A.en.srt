1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,350

and what we're going to do is we're

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:01,360
and what we're going to do is we're
 

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,869
and what we're going to do is we're
going to

4
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
going to
 

5
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,150
going to
a technique for mushy and audio cutter

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
a technique for mushy and audio cutter
 

7
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,590
a technique for mushy and audio cutter
i'm not going to do that you're going to

8
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
i'm not going to do that you're going to
 

9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,230
i'm not going to do that you're going to
do that and who else is strong i know

10
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
do that and who else is strong i know
 

11
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,230
do that and who else is strong i know
matthew's strong oh you're what's wrong

12
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
matthew's strong oh you're what's wrong
 

13
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,990
matthew's strong oh you're what's wrong
are you going to hold me

14
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
are you going to hold me
 

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,470
are you going to hold me
is it so somebody that doesn't know each

16
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
is it so somebody that doesn't know each
 

17
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,349
is it so somebody that doesn't know each
other

18
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
other
 

19
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,150
other
um

20
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
um
 

21
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,830
um
hands by the side

22
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
hands by the side
 

23
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,870
hands by the side
all right advice is a different

24
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
all right advice is a different
 

25
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,029
all right advice is a different
technique

26
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039

 

27
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,950

so hands will your side

28
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
so hands will your side
 

29
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,470
so hands will your side
okay now

30
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
okay now
 

31
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,990
okay now
the technique is

32
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
the technique is
 

33
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,030
the technique is
this

34
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
this
 

35
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,950
this
and you know the vest don't you well he

36
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
and you know the vest don't you well he
 

37
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,869
and you know the vest don't you well he
thinks he does

38
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
thinks he does
 

39
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,670
thinks he does
i want you holding strong

40
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
i want you holding strong
 

41
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,950
i want you holding strong
okay

42
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
okay
 

43
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,790
okay
so how would we ever get the fork theory

44
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
so how would we ever get the fork theory
 

45
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,110
so how would we ever get the fork theory
working here

46
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
working here
 

47
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,510
working here
so so these are the challenges that we

48
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
so so these are the challenges that we
 

49
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,150
so so these are the challenges that we
come up against

50
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160

 

51
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,750

yeah

52
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
yeah
 

53
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,830
yeah
that's it good

54
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
that's it good
 

55
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,029
that's it good
all right

56
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
all right
 

57
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,910
all right
so

58
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
so
 

59
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
so
already puffing them up now what a lot

60
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
already puffing them up now what a lot
 

61
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,910
already puffing them up now what a lot
of peculiar what a lot of people do

62
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
of peculiar what a lot of people do
 

63
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,190
of peculiar what a lot of people do
is this they go like this and they just

64
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
is this they go like this and they just
 

65
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,550
is this they go like this and they just
you're going to let me do it all right

66
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
you're going to let me do it all right
 

67
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,630
you're going to let me do it all right
because i can't

68
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
because i can't
 

69
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,469
because i can't
a lot of people do this you watch the

70
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
a lot of people do this you watch the
 

71
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,910
a lot of people do this you watch the
youtube

00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
youtube
 

73
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,710
youtube
this art comes up and they take a thank

74
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
this art comes up and they take a thank

so they come here
do that they lift it up maintain thank

82
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
do that they lift it up maintain thank
 

83
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,670
do that they lift it up maintain thank
you

84
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
you
 

85
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,149
you
there's no way

86
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
there's no way
 

87
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,830
there's no way
look how much he struggled and he done

88
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
look how much he struggled and he done
 

89
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,390
look how much he struggled and he done
it correct

90
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400

 

91
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,910

okay

92
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
okay
 

93
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,870
okay
so

94
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
so
 

95
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,990
so
you can't lift you do it by turning so

96
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
you can't lift you do it by turning so
 

97
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,550
you can't lift you do it by turning so
it's a conversion look

98
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
it's a conversion look
 

99
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,990
it's a conversion look
of getting his body to escape his body

100
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
of getting his body to escape his body
 

101
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,830
of getting his body to escape his body
escaped

102
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
escaped
 

103
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,709
escaped
you didn't see his hand go over his i've

104
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
you didn't see his hand go over his i've
 

105
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,270
you didn't see his hand go over his i've
been watching his videos today and you

106
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
been watching his videos today and you
 

107
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,670
been watching his videos today and you
didn't see his hand go

108
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
didn't see his hand go
 

109
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,109
didn't see his hand go
separate

110
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
separate
 

111
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,709
separate
separate on its own way to a sankyo but

112
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
separate on its own way to a sankyo but
 

113
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,029
separate on its own way to a sankyo but
now i'm going to ask you to do a sample

114
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039

 

115
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,150

so these are our contradictions that we

116
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
so these are our contradictions that we
 

117
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,869
so these are our contradictions that we
we find difficult okay

118
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
we find difficult okay
 

119
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,190
we find difficult okay
now is he off balance or could he dig in

120
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
now is he off balance or could he dig in
 

121
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,110
now is he off balance or could he dig in
there he could dig in if you didn't want

122
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
there he could dig in if you didn't want
 

123
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,550
there he could dig in if you didn't want
to hurt him

124
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
to hurt him
 

125
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,589
to hurt him
all right

126
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
all right
 

127
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,910
all right
so so the lightness once you start

128
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
so so the lightness once you start
 

129
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,990
so so the lightness once you start
getting involved in these techniques

130
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
getting involved in these techniques
 

131
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,949
getting involved in these techniques
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts

132
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts
 

133
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,869
becomes very difficult it's the ghosts
don't worry

134
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
don't worry
 

135
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,910
don't worry
it's good

136
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
it's good
 

137
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,309
it's good
the person who run the hall before he

138
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
the person who run the hall before he
 

139
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,990
the person who run the hall before he
was one of the helpers he was an

140
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
was one of the helpers he was an
 

141
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,470
was one of the helpers he was an
electrical whip wizard and all the

142
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
electrical whip wizard and all the
 

143
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,390
electrical whip wizard and all the
curtains start closing on their own at

144
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
curtains start closing on their own at
 

145
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,630
curtains start closing on their own at
certain times

146
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
certain times
 

147
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,790
certain times
so

148
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800

 

149
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,949

it's just to show you really

150
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
it's just to show you really
 

151
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,990
it's just to show you really
hate that you cannot

152
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
hate that you cannot
 

153
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,270
hate that you cannot
do this unless you're physically strong

154
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
do this unless you're physically strong
 

155
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,229
do this unless you're physically strong
but you can go oh i've made myself a

156
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
but you can go oh i've made myself a
 

157
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,309
but you can go oh i've made myself a
hummel

158
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319

 

159
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,470

but that's the bit i wanted

160
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
but that's the bit i wanted
 

161
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,309
but that's the bit i wanted
so that when you come out you don't have

162
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
so that when you come out you don't have
 

163
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,670
so that when you come out you don't have
to take that

164
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
to take that
 

165
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,790
to take that
a second bite of the technique

166
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
a second bite of the technique
 

167
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,149
a second bite of the technique
okay

168
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
okay
 

169
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,270
okay
here

170
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
here
 

171
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,750
here
this hand is no good so i to do that

172
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
this hand is no good so i to do that
 

173
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,670
this hand is no good so i to do that
because my shoulder but what i'm going

174
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
because my shoulder but what i'm going
 

175
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,070
because my shoulder but what i'm going
