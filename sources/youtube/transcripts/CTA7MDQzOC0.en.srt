from posting okay
it doesn't matter if you want to come

8
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
it doesn't matter if you want to come
 

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,629
it doesn't matter if you want to come
this way

10
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
this way
 

11
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,669
this way
fine

12
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
fine
 

13
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:25,509
fine
boom

14
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519

 

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,310

so a lot of your guard attacks are

16
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
so a lot of your guard attacks are
 

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,790
so a lot of your guard attacks are
requiring him to be in this 45 degree

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
requiring him to be in this 45 degree
 

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,669
requiring him to be in this 45 degree
angle

20
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
angle
 

21
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,310
angle
of his torso they work much better there

22
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
of his torso they work much better there
 

23
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,389
of his torso they work much better there
then he's all the way up there

24
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
then he's all the way up there
 

25
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,150
then he's all the way up there
or he's all the way putting pressure

26
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
or he's all the way putting pressure
 

27
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,030
or he's all the way putting pressure
down here okay

28
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
down here okay
 

29
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,830
down here okay
so when you start

30
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
so when you start
 

31
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,950
so when you start
administratively you got to take him

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
administratively you got to take him
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,029
administratively you got to take him
into that 45 okay

34
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
into that 45 okay
 

35
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,029
into that 45 okay
so the way that i was taking him into

36
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
so the way that i was taking him into
 

37
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,750
so the way that i was taking him into
that 45 was with the knee pull you see

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
that 45 was with the knee pull you see
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,389
that 45 was with the knee pull you see
now he's in that 45 i can't make him

40
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
now he's in that 45 i can't make him
 

41
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,069
now he's in that 45 i can't make him
come all the way down because now i

42
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
come all the way down because now i
 

43
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,790
come all the way down because now i
won't be able to get the scissor in

44
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
won't be able to get the scissor in
 

45
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,790
won't be able to get the scissor in
place okay so we're starting

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
place okay so we're starting
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,869
place okay so we're starting
administratively

48
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
administratively
 

49
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,030
administratively
move him to that 45

50
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040

 

51
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,190

then you do the shrimp okay

52
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
then you do the shrimp okay
 

53
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,270
then you do the shrimp okay
make sure you're bringing him on you

54
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
make sure you're bringing him on you
 

55
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,670
make sure you're bringing him on you
before you do the scissor sweep

56
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
before you do the scissor sweep
 

57
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,870
before you do the scissor sweep
and you connect so that his falling

58
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
and you connect so that his falling
 

59
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,429
and you connect so that his falling
momentum pulls you up it's not an

60
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
momentum pulls you up it's not an
 

61
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,590
momentum pulls you up it's not an
abdominal exercise

62
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
abdominal exercise
 

63
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,910
abdominal exercise
other than you're using your center to

64
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
other than you're using your center to
 

65
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,710
other than you're using your center to
stay connected to that falling

66
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
stay connected to that falling
 

67
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,190
stay connected to that falling
inertia okay

68
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
inertia okay
 

69
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,069
inertia okay
okay so again this is an administrative

70
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
okay so again this is an administrative
 

71
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,230
okay so again this is an administrative
starting position

72
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
starting position
 

73
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,789
starting position
uh this isn't where you usually find

74
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
uh this isn't where you usually find
 

75
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,950
uh this isn't where you usually find
this stuff especially if you're doing

76
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
this stuff especially if you're doing
 

77
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,030
this stuff especially if you're doing
jiu jitsu he will move his body into

78
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
jiu jitsu he will move his body into
 

79
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,350
jiu jitsu he will move his body into
that 45 position on his own that's the

80
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
that 45 position on his own that's the
 

81
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,990
that 45 position on his own that's the
opening okay this agency with the knee

82
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
opening okay this agency with the knee
 

83
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,230
opening okay this agency with the knee
pull

84
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
pull
 

85
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,350
pull
um

86
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
um
 

87
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,910
um
the guy has to be much less skilled than

88
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
the guy has to be much less skilled than
 

89
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,830
the guy has to be much less skilled than
you

90
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
you
 

91
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,950
you
okay um

92
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960

 

93
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,350

sometimes when the guy feels the scissor

94
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
sometimes when the guy feels the scissor
 

95
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,230
sometimes when the guy feels the scissor
sweep come in he'll open his legs okay

96
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
sweep come in he'll open his legs okay
 

97
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,230
sweep come in he'll open his legs okay
again some beginners will go like this

98
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
again some beginners will go like this
 

99
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,069
again some beginners will go like this
because they're not very flexible and

100
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
because they're not very flexible and
 

101
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,749
because they're not very flexible and
they're trying to relieve their ankles

102
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
they're trying to relieve their ankles
 

103
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,150
they're trying to relieve their ankles
and knees but there's no way he can stop

104
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
and knees but there's no way he can stop
 

105
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,670
and knees but there's no way he can stop
the uh the uh knee pull now because his

106
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
the uh the uh knee pull now because his
 

107
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,470
the uh the uh knee pull now because his
legs don't offer any resistance okay so

108
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
legs don't offer any resistance okay so
 

109
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,030
legs don't offer any resistance okay so
he has to rely totally on his arms but

110
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
he has to rely totally on his arms but
 

111
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,270
he has to rely totally on his arms but
it's easy to get rid of the arms and

112
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
it's easy to get rid of the arms and
 

113
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,470
it's easy to get rid of the arms and
then he can't do anything again so

114
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
then he can't do anything again so
 

115
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,869
then he can't do anything again so
only beginners start out so wide

116
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
only beginners start out so wide
 

117
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,790
only beginners start out so wide
most people are trying to

118
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
most people are trying to
 

119
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,030
most people are trying to
correct this upward posture

120
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
correct this upward posture
 

121
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,270
correct this upward posture
or make more integrity in it because

122
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
or make more integrity in it because
 

123
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,990
or make more integrity in it because
they know the 45 is jacking him up okay

124
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
they know the 45 is jacking him up okay
 

125
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,990
they know the 45 is jacking him up okay
so he could take that away he could use

126
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
so he could take that away he could use
 

127
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,630
so he could take that away he could use
his legs and his core

128
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
his legs and his core
 

129
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,030
his legs and his core
and i cannot do the knee pull okay he

130
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
and i cannot do the knee pull okay he
 

131
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,110
and i cannot do the knee pull okay he
opens his legs like this he only gets

132
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
opens his legs like this he only gets
 

133
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,270
opens his legs like this he only gets
his core and his legs and i'm gonna get

134
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
his core and his legs and i'm gonna get
 

135
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,750
his core and his legs and i'm gonna get
the knee pull every time okay so usually

136
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
the knee pull every time okay so usually
 

137
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,350
the knee pull every time okay so usually
they will feel

138
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
they will feel
 

139
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,830
they will feel
uh

140
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

141
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,830

the scissor in place

142
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
the scissor in place
 

143
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,309
the scissor in place
and that's when he'll open okay he's

144
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
and that's when he'll open okay he's
 

145
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,710
and that's when he'll open okay he's
trying to base out there all right so

146
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
trying to base out there all right so
 

147
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,869
trying to base out there all right so
you'll feel the resistance

148
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
you'll feel the resistance
 

149
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,309
you'll feel the resistance
just follow the initial movement come up

150
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
just follow the initial movement come up
 

151
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,949
just follow the initial movement come up
this is going to do a curve out and back

152
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
this is going to do a curve out and back
 

153
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,910
this is going to do a curve out and back
okay not just out not just back

154
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
okay not just out not just back
 

155
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,830
okay not just out not just back
out and then back and then the

156
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
out and then back and then the
 

157
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,840
out and then back and then the
and the same connection into

158
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:20,850
and the same connection into
 

159
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,789
and the same connection into
[Music]

160
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
[Music]
 

161
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,509
[Music]
so if you want to start there it's okay

162
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
so if you want to start there it's okay
 

163
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,550
so if you want to start there it's okay
for drilling but don't bring that into

164
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
for drilling but don't bring that into
 

165
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,229
for drilling but don't bring that into
your spine or your flow training okay so

166
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
your spine or your flow training okay so
 

167
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,710
your spine or your flow training okay so
i do the same exact technique

168
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
i do the same exact technique
