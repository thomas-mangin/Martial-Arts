and it's just because there's there's a
good biomechanical rule of your arm will

58
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
good biomechanical rule of your arm will
 

59
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,149
good biomechanical rule of your arm will
be supported better if your leg or if

60
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
be supported better if your leg or if
 

61
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,870

that leg is forward right so if it right
 

63
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,870
that leg is forward right so if it right
arm is forward then his right leg should

64
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
arm is forward then his right leg should
 

65
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,190
arm is forward then his right leg should
be forward and that that's going to be

66
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,200
be forward and that that's going to be
 

67
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,469
be forward and that that's going to be
good for him um and then it also makes

68
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
good for him um and then it also makes
 

69
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,149
good for him um and then it also makes
my job kind of easy in a second when we

70
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
my job kind of easy in a second when we
 

71
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,350
my job kind of easy in a second when we

94
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:50,719
that's what he would do he'd go to
 

95
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,270
that's what he would do he'd go to
action okay so that's why it will appear

96
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,280
action okay so that's why it will appear
 

97
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,749
action okay so that's why it will appear
um there's really only four answers to

98
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
um there's really only four answers to
 

99
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,469
um there's really only four answers to
this which really break down to two

100
00:01:59,469 --> 00:01:59,479
this which really break down to two
 

101
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,429
this which really break down to two
answers which really kind of breaks down

102
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
answers which really kind of breaks down
 

103
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,550
answers which really kind of breaks down
to one answer with a condrin so it's

104

to one answer with a condrin so it's
kind of easy to remember although people

106
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
kind of easy to remember although people

when I do that I want the arm high of

124
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:22,760
when I do that I want the arm high of
 

125
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,110
when I do that I want the arm high of
the side I'm turning to so I'm turning

126
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
the side I'm turning to so I'm turning
 

127
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,110
the side I'm turning to so I'm turning
to my right my right arm is going to be

128
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,120
to my right my right arm is going to be
 

129
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,070
to my right my right arm is going to be
high now what I'm trying to do is

130
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
high now what I'm trying to do is
 

131

high now what I'm trying to do is
multifold at this point one I want to

132
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
multifold at this point one I want to
 

133
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,190
multifold at this point one I want to
create a ton of pressure up here at the

134
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
create a ton of pressure up here at the
 

135
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,190
create a ton of pressure up here at the
collar so hopefully that pops his hand

136
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
collar so hopefully that pops his hand
 

137
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,350
collar so hopefully that pops his hand
free and then I'm also hitting him as I

138
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
free and then I'm also hitting him as I
 

139
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,229
free and then I'm also hitting him as I
go through now if I do all of that and

140
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
go through now if I do all of that and
 

141
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,910
go through now if I do all of that and
it works notice I get a really nice

142
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
it works notice I get a really nice
 

143
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,430
it works notice I get a really nice
clean escape on that right so um that's

144
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,440
clean escape on that right so um that's
 

145
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,790
clean escape on that right so um that's
my main idea that's my number one idea

146
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
my main idea that's my number one idea
 

147
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,070
my main idea that's my number one idea
okay now that has to be done in a way to

148
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
okay now that has to be done in a way to
 

149
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,750
okay now that has to be done in a way to
account for what if I turn to the wrong

150
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
account for what if I turn to the wrong
 

151
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,830
account for what if I turn to the wrong
direction so look this is the superior

152
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
direction so look this is the superior
 

153
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,790
direction so look this is the superior
Direction because Josh has got no

154
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,800
Direction because Josh has got no
 

155

recently put up a a little graphic kind
 

159
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,270
recently put up a a little graphic kind
of talking about why Ian is better than

160
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
of talking about why Ian is better than
 

161
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,869
of talking about why Ian is better than
yakui or an ion me here so that's better

162
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:01,879
yakui or an ion me here so that's better
 

163
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,990
yakui or an ion me here so that's better
if I turn this way it's bad because

164
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
if I turn this way it's bad because
 

165
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,910
if I turn this way it's bad because
actually's shoot around here okay if I

166
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
actually's shoot around here okay if I
 

167
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,830
actually's shoot around here okay if I
turn this way it's bad we're yakui and

168
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:08,840
turn this way it's bad we're yakui and
 

169
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,710
turn this way it's bad we're yakui and
all of his defenses and offenses are

170
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
all of his defenses and offenses are
 

171
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,070
all of his defenses and offenses are
here and mine are too but if he's better

172
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
here and mine are too but if he's better
 

173
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,910
here and mine are too but if he's better
than me it's going to be bad right but I

174
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:14,920
than me it's going to be bad right but I
 

175
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,789
than me it's going to be bad right but I
have to account for this right so when I

176
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
have to account for this right so when I
 

177
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,789
have to account for this right so when I
go to that bad inside angle what am I

178
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:18,799
go to that bad inside angle what am I
 

179
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,390
go to that bad inside angle what am I
going to do well I'm going to do the

180
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
going to do well I'm going to do the
 

181
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,110
going to do well I'm going to do the
same beginning because I didn't know

182
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,120
same beginning because I didn't know
 

183
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,990
same beginning because I didn't know
that was a bad inside angle so I'm

184
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
that was a bad inside angle so I'm
 

185
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,670
that was a bad inside angle so I'm
trying to create high pressure here and

186
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
trying to create high pressure here and
 

187
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,110
trying to create high pressure here and
hit him in the head now it could work

188
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,120
hit him in the head now it could work
 

189
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,589
hit him in the head now it could work
his arm has a lot more elasticity this

190
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
his arm has a lot more elasticity this
 

191
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,350
his arm has a lot more elasticity this
way so a lot of times they'll hold on to

192
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
way so a lot of times they'll hold on to
 

193
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,270
way so a lot of times they'll hold on to
you longer but it could work that I pop

194
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
you longer but it could work that I pop
 

195
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,309
you longer but it could work that I pop
his hand free and come here and then I

196
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:35,319
his hand free and come here and then I
 

197
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,350
his hand free and come here and then I
have an Escape Route and it's not as

198
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
have an Escape Route and it's not as
 

199
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,869
have an Escape Route and it's not as
good cuz it's into traffic right so

200
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
good cuz it's into traffic right so
 

201
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,910
good cuz it's into traffic right so
here's the front of his body not as good

202
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
here's the front of his body not as good
 

203
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,070
here's the front of his body not as good
but it can work out that way right so

204
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
but it can work out that way right so
 

205
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,270
but it can work out that way right so
really my primary idea is to create

206
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
really my primary idea is to create
 

207
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,030
really my primary idea is to create
pressure up high in this I'm putting a

208
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
pressure up high in this I'm putting a
 

209
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,949
pressure up high in this I'm putting a
ton of pressure into his hand and I'm

210
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
ton of pressure into his hand and I'm
 

211
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,789
ton of pressure into his hand and I'm
doing that by Rolling my shoulder into

212
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
doing that by Rolling my shoulder into
 

213
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,350
doing that by Rolling my shoulder into
that collar and then this hand's

214
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
that collar and then this hand's
 

215
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,309
that collar and then this hand's
following up by hitting boom and I'm out

216
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
following up by hitting boom and I'm out
 

217
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,470
following up by hitting boom and I'm out
of there and of course if I had a weapon

218
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,480
of there and of course if I had a weapon
 

219
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,030
of there and of course if I had a weapon
in my hand that's all the better right

220
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
in my hand that's all the better right
 

221
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,149
in my hand that's all the better right
so as I come up here boom and goes into

222
00:03:59,149 --> 00:03:59,159
so as I come up here boom and goes into
 

223
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,149
so as I come up here boom and goes into
them and and that's real great for me

224
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,159
them and and that's real great for me
 

225
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,270
them and and that's real great for me
okay so that's our our main ideas all

226
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,280
okay so that's our our main ideas all
 

227
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,229
okay so that's our our main ideas all
right now that has to be done inside and

228
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
right now that has to be done inside and
 

229
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,030
right now that has to be done inside and
outside because I I might turn to the

230
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
outside because I I might turn to the
 

231
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,589
outside because I I might turn to the
wrong direction I also have to account

232
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
wrong direction I also have to account
 

233
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,830
wrong direction I also have to account
for if he is too strong so if Josh is

234
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
for if he is too strong so if Josh is
 

235
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,990
for if he is too strong so if Josh is
super strong and I try to turn here I

236
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
super strong and I try to turn here I
 

237
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,189
super strong and I try to turn here I
will get about this far and I'm maybe

238
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
will get about this far and I'm maybe
 

239
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,590
will get about this far and I'm maybe
trying to hit him if I had a knife I

240
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
trying to hit him if I had a knife I
 

241
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,749
trying to hit him if I had a knife I
might be able to work him off that way

242
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:18,759
might be able to work him off that way
 

243
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,349
might be able to work him off that way
or stick or something but I'm trying to

244
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:20,359
or stick or something but I'm trying to
 

245
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,390
or stick or something but I'm trying to
turn he's just so strong that I can't

246
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
turn he's just so strong that I can't
 

247
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,909
turn he's just so strong that I can't
get through this I need an answer and my

248
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
get through this I need an answer and my
 

249
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,550
get through this I need an answer and my
immediate answer is to drop under that

250
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,560
immediate answer is to drop under that
 

251
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,270
immediate answer is to drop under that
here okay so now what's great is is I

252
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
here okay so now what's great is is I
 

253
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,430
here okay so now what's great is is I
opened up all of this stuff here I've

254
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,440
opened up all of this stuff here I've
 

255
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,070
opened up all of this stuff here I've
started really putting a lot of pressure

256
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
started really putting a lot of pressure
 

257
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,029
started really putting a lot of pressure
on this grip and I've turned things

258
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039
on this grip and I've turned things
 

259
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,350
on this grip and I've turned things
around for myself now in my kids class

260
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,360
around for myself now in my kids class
 

261
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,629
around for myself now in my kids class
because they're weird and flexible

262
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:39,639
because they're weird and flexible
 

263
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,710
because they're weird and flexible
little kids they will spin about 40

264
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:41,720
little kids they will spin about 40
 

265
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,670
little kids they will spin about 40
times from here and I don't recommend it

266
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
times from here and I don't recommend it
 

267
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,110
times from here and I don't recommend it
but it will work I'll tell you even with

268
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
but it will work I'll tell you even with
 

269
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,950
but it will work I'll tell you even with
my grip after they spin about 40 times

270
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
my grip after they spin about 40 times
 

271
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,350
my grip after they spin about 40 times
from here I mean I could have punched

272
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
from here I mean I could have punched
 

273
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,590
from here I mean I could have punched
them in the face 40 times myself but

274
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,600
them in the face 40 times myself but
 

275
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,270
them in the face 40 times myself but
they spin even my grip will come off

276
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,280
they spin even my grip will come off
 

277
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,310
they spin even my grip will come off
right so so by creating this pressure

278
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
right so so by creating this pressure
 

279
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,150
right so so by creating this pressure
you're fairly likely to make it off the

280
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,160
you're fairly likely to make it off the
 

281
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,110
you're fairly likely to make it off the
second time that you do that right so

282
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
second time that you do that right so
 

283
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,909
second time that you do that right so
that is something come from it but a lot

284
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:00,919
that is something come from it but a lot
 

285
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,870
that is something come from it but a lot
of other stuff can come out of that also

286
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
of other stuff can come out of that also
 

287
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,150
of other stuff can come out of that also
right so as I turn and hit this

288
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160
right so as I turn and hit this
 

289
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,110
right so as I turn and hit this
interference right here I can come up

290
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
interference right here I can come up
 

291
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,909
interference right here I can come up
here and I can triangle out and I can do

292
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:08,919
here and I can triangle out and I can do
 

293
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,629
here and I can triangle out and I can do
all kinds of different stuff so if I hit

294
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
all kinds of different stuff so if I hit
 

295
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,590
all kinds of different stuff so if I hit
that initial problem and I I train

296
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
that initial problem and I I train
 

297
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,070
that initial problem and I I train
myself to immediately sink under it will

298
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
myself to immediately sink under it will
 

299
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,830
myself to immediately sink under it will
lead to new possibilities for me

300
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:16,840
lead to new possibilities for me
 

301
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,029
lead to new possibilities for me
remember all this stuff has to be done

302
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:18,039
remember all this stuff has to be done
 

303
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,590
remember all this stuff has to be done
fast fast fast because there's someone

304
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
fast fast fast because there's someone
 

305
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,230
fast fast fast because there's someone
else coming in this guy's really big and

306
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
else coming in this guy's really big and
 

307
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,469
else coming in this guy's really big and
strong the more I slow down the bad it's

308
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:23,479
strong the more I slow down the bad it's
 

309
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,110
strong the more I slow down the bad it's
the worse it's going to be for me okay

310
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
the worse it's going to be for me okay
 

311
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,990
the worse it's going to be for me okay
so that also has to be true for the

312
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
so that also has to be true for the
 

313
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,070
so that also has to be true for the
inside as well so I turn here and he's

314
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,080
inside as well so I turn here and he's
 

315
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,590
inside as well so I turn here and he's
super strong going to have no effect on

316
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
super strong going to have no effect on
 

317
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,309
super strong going to have no effect on
him and I can't just get away I'm going

318
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:32,319
him and I can't just get away I'm going
 

319
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,830
him and I can't just get away I'm going
to drop under now this leads to ton of

320
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:34,840
to drop under now this leads to ton of
 

321
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,469
to drop under now this leads to ton of
classic techniques EO Etc there there's

322
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:37,479
classic techniques EO Etc there there's
 

323
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,029
classic techniques EO Etc there there's
tons and tons of techniques in there for

324
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
tons and tons of techniques in there for
 

325
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,950
tons and tons of techniques in there for
that but that's the basic ideas for the

326
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
that but that's the basic ideas for the
 

327
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,070
that but that's the basic ideas for the
hoki so I'm either going to turn outside

328
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
hoki so I'm either going to turn outside
 

329
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,670
hoki so I'm either going to turn outside
I'm going to turn inside or I'm going to

330
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm going to turn inside or I'm going to
 

331
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,870
I'm going to turn inside or I'm going to
go outside high to low and that leads

332
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
go outside high to low and that leads
 

333
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,990
go outside high to low and that leads
into cages and all kinds of stuff so you

334
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,000
into cages and all kinds of stuff so you
 

335
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,790
into cages and all kinds of stuff so you
know in the forms you'll see those kinds

336
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
know in the forms you'll see those kinds
 

337
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,670
know in the forms you'll see those kinds
of things as hoki also um or I'm going

338
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
of things as hoki also um or I'm going
 

339
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,230
of things as hoki also um or I'm going
to go inside High high to low and that

340
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,240
to go inside High high to low and that
 

341
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,870
to go inside High high to low and that
leads to all this stuff that can happen

342
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
leads to all this stuff that can happen
 

343
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,870
leads to all this stuff that can happen
in there right so there's a ton of

344
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
in there right so there's a ton of
 

345
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,390
in there right so there's a ton of
little techniques in there that become

346
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
little techniques in there that become
 

347
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,710
little techniques in there that become
further additions to hoki but those four

348
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:09,720
further additions to hoki but those four
 

349
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,710
further additions to hoki but those four
which really break down to two which

350
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:11,720
which really break down to two which
 

351
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,309
which really break down to two which
really breaks down to one with an

352
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:13,319
really breaks down to one with an
 

353
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,830
really breaks down to one with an
adaptation is basically the work that I

354
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
adaptation is basically the work that I
 

355
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,550
adaptation is basically the work that I
do for ushiro edori for hoki for all the

356
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
do for ushiro edori for hoki for all the
 

357
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,870
do for ushiro edori for hoki for all the
escapes then there's lots of little

358
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:19,880
escapes then there's lots of little
 

359
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,150
escapes then there's lots of little
techniques in there and that's another

360
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,160
techniques in there and that's another
 

361
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,029
techniques in there and that's another
video we could talk about um you really

362
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
video we could talk about um you really
 

363
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,629
video we could talk about um you really
shouldn't be interested in my opinion in

364
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
shouldn't be interested in my opinion in
 

365
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,510
shouldn't be interested in my opinion in
collecting techniques from positions

366
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
collecting techniques from positions
 

367
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,950
collecting techniques from positions
because it's not really all that useful

368
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
because it's not really all that useful
 

369
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,309
because it's not really all that useful
however you should understand in the

370
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
however you should understand in the
 

371
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,350
however you should understand in the
position what is my hierarchy of things

372
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,360
position what is my hierarchy of things
 

373
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,830
position what is my hierarchy of things
I'm going to do and then techniques will

374
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm going to do and then techniques will
 

375
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm going to do and then techniques will
naturally appear out of that because

376
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
naturally appear out of that because
 

377
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,469
naturally appear out of that because
that's what the techniques are for all

378
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:37,479
that's what the techniques are for all
 

379
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,309
that's what the techniques are for all
that said I'm Christopher hin Joshua tii

380
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
that said I'm Christopher hin Joshua tii
 

381
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,990
that said I'm Christopher hin Joshua tii
