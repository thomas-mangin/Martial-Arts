push and when you feel him brace that's

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
push and when you feel him brace that's
 

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,950
push and when you feel him brace that's
when you go to the

push back although that would be better

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
push back although that would be better
 

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,230
push back although that would be better
but he just braces you see oh he

00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:23,959

 

85
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,789

one okay so same thing I drive he drives

86
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:27,799
one okay so same thing I drive he drives
 

87
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,270
one okay so same thing I drive he drives
back Tak it into a spiral

88
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
back Tak it into a spiral
 

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,550
back Tak it into a spiral
go all the way to M leave his arm on

90
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560

 

91
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,550

you so I drive he drives

92
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:45,560
you so I drive he drives
 

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:58,670
you so I drive he drives
back but I take it into a spiral

94
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680

 

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:10,190

Drive

96
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200

 

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:28,590

drive me

98
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600

 

99
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,590

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600

 

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,670

let's SL back down let's clean up

102
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
let's SL back down let's clean up
 

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,270
let's SL back down let's clean up
do so yeah I have this and then I went

104
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
do so yeah I have this and then I went
 

105
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,070
do so yeah I have this and then I went
for this

106
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
for this
 

107
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,029
for this
tricep camera where are you you see that

108
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,039
tricep camera where are you you see that
 

109
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,029
tricep camera where are you you see that
tricep this Hook is what I'm going to

110
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:57,039
tricep this Hook is what I'm going to
 

111
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,749
tricep this Hook is what I'm going to
do got it you see

112
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759

 

113
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,830

yeah so when I push and then he drives

114
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:10,840
yeah so when I push and then he drives
 

115
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,390
yeah so when I push and then he drives
back first let me show you the hook

116
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,400
back first let me show you the hook
 

117
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,830
back first let me show you the hook
there's no no energy driving back no

118
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
there's no no energy driving back no
 

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:24,990
there's no no energy driving back no
energy and I'm going to use the

120
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,000

 

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,469

hook there's a lot of Leverage in

122
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
hook there's a lot of Leverage in
 

123
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,629
hook there's a lot of Leverage in
it

124
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:35,639

 

125
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,629

then he now has a Nur going that way so

126
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:39,639
then he now has a Nur going that way so
 

127
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:47,710
then he now has a Nur going that way so
he goes he goes that

128
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:47,720

 

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,350

way even more do you understand yes

130
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,360
way even more do you understand yes
 

131
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,150
way even more do you understand yes
sir and

132
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
sir and
 

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,029
sir and
now I'll take his inertia

134
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
now I'll take his inertia
 

135
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,430
now I'll take his inertia
out but it none of his is

136
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
out but it none of his is
 

137
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,270
out but it none of his is
inertia and I'm just going to use my

138
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,280
inertia and I'm just going to use my
 

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:14,830
inertia and I'm just going to use my
body weight instead of just my

140
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840

 

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,469

arm way more inertia

142
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479

 

143
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,390

right and

144
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
right and
 

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,390
right and
now I add his

146
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400

 

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,990

momentum

148
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000

 

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,350

it's even

150
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
it's even
 

151
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,790
it's even
faster way more energy you understand I

152
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800

 

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,350

Ser

154
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,360

 

155
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,990

then when I pull down on this weight is

156
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
then when I pull down on this weight is
 

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,710
then when I pull down on this weight is
going to go on that

158
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720
going to go on that
 

159
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,189
going to go on that
leg he can't step again on that leg to

160
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:58,199
leg he can't step again on that leg to
 

161
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,510
leg he can't step again on that leg to
regain his Valance

162
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,520
regain his Valance
 

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,950
regain his Valance
he has to step forward do you understand

164
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:03,960
he has to step forward do you understand
 

165
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,430
he has to step forward do you understand
yes sir so that's where that leg comes

166
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,440
yes sir so that's where that leg comes
 

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,350
yes sir so that's where that leg comes
so if you don't

168
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360

 

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,469

mind you step on that foot that

170
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:15,479
mind you step on that foot that
 

171
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,510
mind you step on that foot that
represents an energy that stops him to

172
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,520
represents an energy that stops him to
 

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,350
represents an energy that stops him to
from stepping forward you see and that's

174
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
from stepping forward you see and that's
 

175
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,589
from stepping forward you see and that's
going to affect his balance his leg down

176
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
going to affect his balance his leg down
 

177
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,309
going to affect his balance his leg down
right you all right yeah okay please

178
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
right you all right yeah okay please
 

179
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,909
right you all right yeah okay please
