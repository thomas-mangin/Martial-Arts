so
 

11
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,509
so
the question is

12
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
the question is
 

13
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,670
the question is

and bracing angles
 

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,830
and bracing angles
so instead of ground vectoring

30
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
so instead of ground vectoring
 

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,710
so instead of ground vectoring
you're bracing you can't move till he's

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
you're bracing you can't move till he's

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,550

so he has to keep

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,789
and moving him
even as his fingers are closed

pulling on his fingers
 

65
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,429
pulling on his fingers
so inside of his grip

66
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439

 

67
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,509

that starts the movement so i he

68
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
that starts the movement so i he
 

69
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,630
that starts the movement so i he
and then

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
and then
 

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,949
and then
this next ikea adhesion

72
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
this next ikea adhesion
 

73
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,189

on the outside here
 

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,509
on the outside here
this keeps me going

78
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
this keeps me going
 

79
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:37,430
this keeps me going
okay

80
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440

 

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:46,310

then i enter over here

82
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320

 

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,909

not pull

84
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
not pull
 

85
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,350
not pull
not pull

86
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
not pull
 

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,830
not pull
and he stops and then you enter straight

88
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and he stops and then you enter straight
 

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,830
and he stops and then you enter straight
to his back

90
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
to his back
 

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,510
to his back
incorrect

93
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,790

and here

94
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
and here
 

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,909
and here
i hear the dirt behind him

96
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
i hear the dirt behind him
 

97
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,189
i hear the dirt behind him
sideways

98
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199

 

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,790

so if he is at 12 o'clock i'm going to

100
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
so if he is at 12 o'clock i'm going to
 

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,430
so if he is at 12 o'clock i'm going to
actually enter somewhere

102
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
actually enter somewhere
 

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,550
actually enter somewhere
around 9 00 or 8 30.

104
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
around 9 00 or 8 30.
 

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,010
around 9 00 or 8 30.
okay all right

106
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,020

these three things
 

111
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,230
these three things
while he's moving

112
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
while he's moving
 

113
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,670
while he's moving
to he keeps moving and three i keep

114
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
to he keeps moving and three i keep
 

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,790
to he keeps moving and three i keep

so again never

118
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
so again never

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,469

okay let's try

122
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479

 

123
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,950

all right so

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
all right so
 

125
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,670
all right so
i guess the question would be uh sensei

126
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
i guess the question would be uh sensei
 

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,029
i guess the question would be uh sensei
how come you don't have to grab his

128

how come you don't have to grab his

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,790
how come you don't have to grab his

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,350

okay

132
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360

 

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,950

uh again

134
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
uh again
 

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,790
uh again
we're grabbing the shoulders it's a

136
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
we're grabbing the shoulders it's a
 

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,150
we're grabbing the shoulders it's a
pulling movement okay so pulling means

138
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
pulling movement okay so pulling means
 

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,749
pulling movement okay so pulling means
that i'm far away from him

140
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
that i'm far away from him
 

141
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,390
that i'm far away from him
that's how i can pull him okay

142
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
that's how i can pull him okay
 

143
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,510
that's how i can pull him okay
and pulling him to me

144
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520
and pulling him to me
 

145
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,469
and pulling him to me
secondarily

146
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
secondarily
 

147
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,189
secondarily
it means that we have distance between

148
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
it means that we have distance between
 

149
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,950
it means that we have distance between
us how the distance get there because

150
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
us how the distance get there because
 

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,110
us how the distance get there because
we're heading in opposite directions

152
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
we're heading in opposite directions
 

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,270
we're heading in opposite directions
that's why i have to pull him to me and

154
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
that's why i have to pull him to me and
 

155
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,350
that's why i have to pull him to me and
the directions that were headed are

156
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
the directions that were headed are
 

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,110
the directions that were headed are
linear uh in their orientation so what i

158
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
linear uh in their orientation so what i
 

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,710
linear uh in their orientation so what i
do instead

160
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
do instead
 

161
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,510
do instead
is that i'm near him

162
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
is that i'm near him
 

163
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,790
is that i'm near him
and we're not linear in our orientation

164
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
and we're not linear in our orientation
 

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,070
and we're not linear in our orientation
we're circular and i'm close to him

166
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
we're circular and i'm close to him
 

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,950
we're circular and i'm close to him
okay

168
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
okay
 

169
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,550
okay
so as uh i coming around

170
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
so as uh i coming around
 

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,110
so as uh i coming around
i don't go here for example now i'm

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
i don't go here for example now i'm
 

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,950
i don't go here for example now i'm
moving in the opposite direction that

174
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
moving in the opposite direction that
 

175
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,710
moving in the opposite direction that
he's going okay

176
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
he's going okay
 

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,309
he's going okay
uh

178
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
uh
 

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,469
uh
let's rewind a little bit

180
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
let's rewind a little bit
 

181
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,270
let's rewind a little bit
so

182
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
so
 

183

you see

you see
but i left him here and i now did it

but i left him here and i now did it
 

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,790

there okay and i'm gonna pull him

so i

198
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
so i
 

199
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,870
