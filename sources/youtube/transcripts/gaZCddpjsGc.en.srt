00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,270
this hand,
you can't do it here. You have to get on

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
you can't do it here. You have to get on
 

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,830
you can't do it here. You have to get on
the other side of it. So, you have to

22
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
the other side of it. So, you have to
 

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,910

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,190
