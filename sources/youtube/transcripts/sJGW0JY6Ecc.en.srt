1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,350

all right the footwork now we're going

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
all right the footwork now we're going
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,629
all right the footwork now we're going
to do a ipti syu all right so the

4
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:07,639
to do a ipti syu all right so the
 

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,230
to do a ipti syu all right so the
footwork couple things to understand is

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
footwork couple things to understand is
 

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,789
footwork couple things to understand is
we don't want to be double weighted and

8
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:15,799
we don't want to be double weighted and
 

9
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,230
we don't want to be double weighted and
so I'll Define what double weighted

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
so I'll Define what double weighted
 

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,109
so I'll Define what double weighted
means uh we don't want our Center

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
means uh we don't want our Center
 

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,269
means uh we don't want our Center
gravity

14
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:22,279
gravity
 

15
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,990
gravity
between the elements of our basis

16
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
between the elements of our basis
 

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,029
between the elements of our basis
support okay so right now I'm in the

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
support okay so right now I'm in the
 

19
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,749
support okay so right now I'm in the
horse stance

20
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:31,759
horse stance
 

21
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,150
horse stance
and the elements of my basic support are

22
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
and the elements of my basic support are
 

23
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,270
and the elements of my basic support are
my two

24
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,280
my two
 

25
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,709
my two
feet I don't want my center of gravity

26
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
feet I don't want my center of gravity
 

27
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,830
feet I don't want my center of gravity
sitting in the middle of it ining those

28
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
sitting in the middle of it ining those
 

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,950
sitting in the middle of it ining those
things okay so in application I would

30
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
things okay so in application I would
 

31
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,110
things okay so in application I would
always move my center of gravity over to

32
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,120
always move my center of gravity over to
 

33
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,029
always move my center of gravity over to
one Bas of support such that this foot

34
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
one Bas of support such that this foot
 

35
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,150
one Bas of support such that this foot
it doesn't have weight on it in terms of

36
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
it doesn't have weight on it in terms of
 

37
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,069
it doesn't have weight on it in terms of
for example the boat rowing exercise

38
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,079
for example the boat rowing exercise
 

39
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,590
for example the boat rowing exercise
really what is important to understand

40
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
really what is important to understand
 

41
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,670
really what is important to understand
like a lot of times people are just

42
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
like a lot of times people are just
 

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,749
like a lot of times people are just
doing this stuff and then they have

44
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:10,759
doing this stuff and then they have
 

45
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,990
doing this stuff and then they have
uh Stupid applications all the time this

46
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
uh Stupid applications all the time this
 

47
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,830
uh Stupid applications all the time this
is very much common in iido so let's see

48
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
is very much common in iido so let's see
 

49
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,990
is very much common in iido so let's see
I I'm doing these rolling exercises do

50
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
I I'm doing these rolling exercises do
 

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,350
I I'm doing these rolling exercises do
you see and then uh people go and then I

52
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
you see and then uh people go and then I
 

53
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,190
you see and then uh people go and then I
do my

54
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200

 

55
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,830

technique so I'm going to

56
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:30,840
technique so I'm going to
 

57
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,190
technique so I'm going to
Row in

58
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
Row in
 

59
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,910
Row in
here here and then and somehow there

60
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
here here and then and somehow there
 

61
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,149
here here and then and somehow there
like oh it's magic Presto because and

62
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:39,159
like oh it's magic Presto because and
 

63
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,749
like oh it's magic Presto because and
it's so awesome because I did it from

64
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
it's so awesome because I did it from
 

65
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,950
it's so awesome because I did it from
here you see the same thing in the sword

66
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
here you see the same thing in the sword
 

67
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,069
here you see the same thing in the sword
work so people go it's like the sword

68
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
work so people go it's like the sword
 

69
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,590
work so people go it's like the sword
and then U they'll bring out the sword

70
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:52,600
and then U they'll bring out the sword
 

71
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,429
and then U they'll bring out the sword
and then everyone goes oh and then it

72
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
and then everyone goes oh and then it
 

73
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,429
and then everyone goes oh and then it
works you know it's was like but was the

74
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
works you know it's was like but was the
 

75
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,069
works you know it's was like but was the
sword valid was the sword work valid do

76
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
sword valid was the sword work valid do
 

77
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,310
sword valid was the sword work valid do
you get what I'm saying so I'm you're

78
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
you get what I'm saying so I'm you're
 

79
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,270
you get what I'm saying so I'm you're
going to go here and here and then they

80
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,280
going to go here and here and then they
 

81
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,270
going to go here and here and then they
go oh see if he grabs me I here and

82
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
go oh see if he grabs me I here and
 

83
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,589
go oh see if he grabs me I here and
here and then he goes like the sword

84
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:16,599
here and then he goes like the sword
 

85
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,509
here and then he goes like the sword
every okay all right so same thing you

86
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519
every okay all right so same thing you
 

87
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,350
every okay all right so same thing you
have these rowing exercises they've made

88
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,360
have these rowing exercises they've made
 

89
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,509
have these rowing exercises they've made
their way in iido throughout history but

90
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:25,519
their way in iido throughout history but
 

91
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,869
their way in iido throughout history but
they're not being done correctly Okay so

92
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:29,879
they're not being done correctly Okay so
 

93
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,509
they're not being done correctly Okay so
first thing we said was I don't want to

94
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,519
first thing we said was I don't want to
 

95
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,309
first thing we said was I don't want to
ever be double weighted all right and

96
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:35,319
ever be double weighted all right and
 

97
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,430
ever be double weighted all right and
then I gave you an example that I would

98
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,440
then I gave you an example that I would
 

99
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,910
then I gave you an example that I would
have my line of gry over here such that

100
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
have my line of gry over here such that
 

101
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,830
have my line of gry over here such that
this foot actually has no weight on it

102
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
this foot actually has no weight on it
 

103
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,149
this foot actually has no weight on it
even though it's touching the ground

104
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:44,159
even though it's touching the ground
 

105
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,869
even though it's touching the ground
it's mobile I can slide it around if I

106
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
it's mobile I can slide it around if I
 

107
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,750
it's mobile I can slide it around if I
have my weight here or here's my line of

108
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
have my weight here or here's my line of
 

109
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,550
have my weight here or here's my line of
gravity I can't actually slide it it

110
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
gravity I can't actually slide it it
 

111
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,750
gravity I can't actually slide it it
gets kind of stuck on there okay all

112
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
gets kind of stuck on there okay all
 

113
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,149
gets kind of stuck on there okay all
right um

114
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
right um
 

115
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,750
right um
actually so

116
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
actually so
 

117
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,110
actually so
somewhere in there as I'm trying not to

118
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
somewhere in there as I'm trying not to
 

119
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,710
somewhere in there as I'm trying not to
double weight I'm have to shift my

120
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
double weight I'm have to shift my
 

121
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,509
double weight I'm have to shift my
weight and somewhere in shifting my

122
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
weight and somewhere in shifting my
 

123
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,070
weight and somewhere in shifting my
weight I have to bend my knees okay and

124
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,080
weight I have to bend my knees okay and
 

125
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,990
weight I have to bend my knees okay and
the way it works is that my knee my knee

126
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,000
the way it works is that my knee my knee
 

127
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,630
the way it works is that my knee my knee
is actually governed by my ankle so my

128
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
is actually governed by my ankle so my
 

129
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,710
is actually governed by my ankle so my
ankle can only either be

130
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:27,720
ankle can only either be
 

131
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,470
ankle can only either be
straight you see

132
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,480
straight you see
 

133
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,990
straight you see
and to have my ankle straight I have to

134
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,000
and to have my ankle straight I have to
 

135
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,470
and to have my ankle straight I have to
bend my knee you see

136
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,480
bend my knee you see
 

137
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,229
bend my knee you see
that and my knee at

138
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
that and my knee at
 

139
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,670
that and my knee at
Max can't go past my toes do you see

140
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
Max can't go past my toes do you see
 

141
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,270
Max can't go past my toes do you see
that so if I go over here like this my

142
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,280
that so if I go over here like this my
 

143
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,869
that so if I go over here like this my
center of gravity is over here in front

144
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
center of gravity is over here in front
 

145
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,190
center of gravity is over here in front
of my foot I want to fall forward okay

146
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
of my foot I want to fall forward okay
 

147
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,030
of my foot I want to fall forward okay
so when you do the bow rowing

148
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
so when you do the bow rowing
 

149
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,670
so when you do the bow rowing
exercise you're actually taking your

150
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
exercise you're actually taking your
 

151
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,910
exercise you're actually taking your
ankle from

152
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:02,920
ankle from
 

153
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,589
ankle from
straight to toes now do it on the back

154
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:06,599
straight to toes now do it on the back
 

155
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,229
straight to toes now do it on the back
leg Dave all right straight to toes you

156
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
leg Dave all right straight to toes you
 

157
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:18,949
leg Dave all right straight to toes you
see that

158
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959

 

159
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,469

home so what I'm doing is as I go knee

160
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
home so what I'm doing is as I go knee
 

161
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,749
home so what I'm doing is as I go knee
to toes here at knees to toes I'm

162
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
to toes here at knees to toes I'm
 

163
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,590
to toes here at knees to toes I'm
actually on this leg I'm on this leg

this leg can slide and when I come back
 

167
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,469
this leg can slide and when I come back
to here I'm on that leg and this leg can

168
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
to here I'm on that leg and this leg can
 

169
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,950

yangong put it in Yin the other one's in
 

183
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,550
yangong put it in Yin the other one's in
Yang and here is your boat exercise

184
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
Yang and here is your boat exercise
 

185
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,629
Yang and here is your boat exercise
okay

186
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
okay
 

187
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,950
okay
now let's

188

now let's
 

189
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,909
now let's
turn or let's go straight let's go

190

turn or let's go straight let's go
 

191
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,150
turn or let's go straight let's go
straight so when I want to do a

192
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
straight so when I want to do a
 

193
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,189
straight so when I want to do a
yumii I'm going to put this leg from the

194
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
yumii I'm going to put this leg from the
 

195
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,830
yumii I'm going to put this leg from the
yin phase into the Yang phase now all

196
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:14,840
yin phase into the Yang phase now all
 

197
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,510
yin phase into the Yang phase now all
weight is on that leg and then I move

198
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
weight is on that leg and then I move
 

199
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,830
weight is on that leg and then I move
forward take this

200
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
forward take this
 

201
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,909
forward take this
knee put it in it Yin face and now my

202
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
knee put it in it Yin face and now my
 

203
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,670
knee put it in it Yin face and now my
knee is in the y face here and this is

204
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
knee is in the y face here and this is
 

205
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,230
knee is in the y face here and this is
how I'm

206
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
how I'm
 

207
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,830
how I'm
moving

208
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:32,840
moving
 

209
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,710
moving
boom boom and I'll show you

210
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:37,720

 

211
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,309

why if he is resisting me he's pushing

212
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:42,319
why if he is resisting me he's pushing
 

213
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,749
why if he is resisting me he's pushing
me and I try to walk right now my Center

214
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
me and I try to walk right now my Center
 

215
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,590
me and I try to walk right now my Center
gravity is in the middle and I try to

216
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600
gravity is in the middle and I try to
 

217
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,070
gravity is in the middle and I try to
walk I can't go forward okay he

218
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,080
walk I can't go forward okay he
 

219
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,950
walk I can't go forward okay he
interrupts my attempt to go forward

220
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:55,960
interrupts my attempt to go forward
 

221
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,189
interrupts my attempt to go forward
because my Center gravity will just come

222
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:58,199
because my Center gravity will just come
 

223
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,950
because my Center gravity will just come
off of the bracing angle of the back leg

224
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
off of the bracing angle of the back leg
 

225
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,189
off of the bracing angle of the back leg
and be pushed right back onto it so

226
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
and be pushed right back onto it so
 

227
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,550
and be pushed right back onto it so
instead I have to bring this into a Yin

228
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
instead I have to bring this into a Yin
 

229
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,990
instead I have to bring this into a Yin
face and he's pushing and really what

230
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
face and he's pushing and really what
 

231
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,830
face and he's pushing and really what
I'm doing is I'm now grounding on that

232
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840
I'm doing is I'm now grounding on that
 

233
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,029
I'm doing is I'm now grounding on that
leg then I can move forward okay you

234
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
leg then I can move forward okay you
 

235
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,270
leg then I can move forward okay you
guys understand that is it clear is it

236
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
guys understand that is it clear is it
 

237
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,790
guys understand that is it clear is it
clear okay now I want to turn so in

238
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
clear okay now I want to turn so in
 

239
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
clear okay now I want to turn so in
order to go straight I have to do this

240
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
order to go straight I have to do this
 

241
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,909
order to go straight I have to do this
Yin and on with my knee angle and my

242
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:30,919
Yin and on with my knee angle and my
 

243
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,990
Yin and on with my knee angle and my
ankle Angle now I'm going to turn Okay

244
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
ankle Angle now I'm going to turn Okay
 

245
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,070
ankle Angle now I'm going to turn Okay
so to turn it's going to be the same

246
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,080
so to turn it's going to be the same
 

247
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,589
so to turn it's going to be the same
thing I don't want to double pivot

248
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:40,599
thing I don't want to double pivot
 

249
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,950
thing I don't want to double pivot
because now I'm double weighted so I

250
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
because now I'm double weighted so I
 

251
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,510
because now I'm double weighted so I
never double pivot never double PIV okay

252
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
never double pivot never double PIV okay
 

253
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,550
never double pivot never double PIV okay
I always am going to bring one leg into

254
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
I always am going to bring one leg into
 

255
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,230
I always am going to bring one leg into
the Yang phase and then

256
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,240
the Yang phase and then
 

257
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,990
the Yang phase and then
turn on that leg so I would bring

258
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
turn on that leg so I would bring
 

259
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,749
turn on that leg so I would bring
weight here and this this foot is now

260
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
weight here and this this foot is now
 

261
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,350
weight here and this this foot is now
free to move the weight is here and then

262
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
free to move the weight is here and then
 

263
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,390
free to move the weight is here and then
I turn and I single pivot okay so let's

264
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
I turn and I single pivot okay so let's
 

265
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,189
I turn and I single pivot okay so let's
say for

266
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
say for
 

267
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,670

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:19,479
handup okay I'm not going to go
 

271
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,550
handup okay I'm not going to go
here and then turn with my weight

272
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
here and then turn with my weight
 

273
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,350
here and then turn with my weight
between my

274
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
between my
 

275
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,390
between my
legs I will

276
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
legs I will
 

277
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,230
legs I will
enter shift my weight onto the one

278
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,240
enter shift my weight onto the one
 

279
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,150
enter shift my weight onto the one
leg and pivot on that leg this step back

280
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
leg and pivot on that leg this step back
 

281
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,950
leg and pivot on that leg this step back
has no rotation in

not going to work all right let's try
 

515
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,749
not going to work all right let's try
to

516
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759

 

517
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,430

okay so when if you watch my knees get

518
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
okay so when if you watch my knees get
 

519
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,189
okay so when if you watch my knees get
where you need to be in okay so when I

520
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:38,199
where you need to be in okay so when I
 

521
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,629
where you need to be in okay so when I
go back this knee is going to go to that

522
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,639
go back this knee is going to go to that
 

523
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,509
go back this knee is going to go to that
Yang phase you see okay but when I

524
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
Yang phase you see okay but when I
 

525
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,550
Yang phase you see okay but when I
finish that maneuver the ankle is

526
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
finish that maneuver the ankle is
 

527
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,269
finish that maneuver the ankle is
straight you see that so when I do the

528
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:52,279
straight you see that so when I do the
 

529
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,670
straight you see that so when I do the
aashi forward then it has to go back

530
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,680
aashi forward then it has to go back
 

531
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,269
aashi forward then it has to go back
into that okay other otherwise when I

532
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:00,279
into that okay other otherwise when I
 

533
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,670
into that okay other otherwise when I
try to step I would be pushed okay so

534
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
try to step I would be pushed okay so
 

535
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,550
try to step I would be pushed okay so
you have your just hold it however you

536
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
you have your just hold it however you
 

537

you have your just hold it however you
want sure whatever okay so to go forward

538
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:10,920

an oncoming resistance so I have to
 

547
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,910
an oncoming resistance so I have to
shift and now that foot can work you get

548
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:22,920
shift and now that foot can work you get
 

549
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,870

go up boom it's here boom in straight
 

611
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,590
go up boom it's here boom in straight
you see and you would carry that over so

612
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
you see and you would carry that over so
 

613
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,149
you see and you would carry that over so
I would go straight and then the turn

614
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:14,159
I would go straight and then the turn
 

615
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,230
I would go straight and then the turn
you see how I did that make sure you're

616
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
you see how I did that make sure you're
 

617
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,350
you see how I did that make sure you're
not ski and still or still in ski and

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
try to so at the end of each count of
 

623
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,710
try to so at the end of each count of
the suity you always have the ski and

624
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:27,720
the suity you always have the ski and
 

625
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,909
the suity you always have the ski and
the turn

626
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:28,919
the turn
 

627
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,590
the turn
and then the cut okay so that part's the

628
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
and then the cut okay so that part's the
 

629
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,110
and then the cut okay so that part's the
same but what is also always the same is

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
same but what is also always the same is
 

631
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,909
same but what is also always the same is
you're going from the yin phase ankle

632
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
you're going from the yin phase ankle
 

633
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,470
you're going from the yin phase ankle
straight to the Yang phase whether

634
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
straight to the Yang phase whether
 

635
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,390
straight to the Yang phase whether
you're going forward or whether you're

636
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
you're going forward or whether you're
 

637
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,470
you're going forward or whether you're
turning you have to do that so that you

638
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,480
turning you have to do that so that you
 

639
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,390
turning you have to do that so that you
don't double weight or double pivot or

640
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
don't double weight or double pivot or
 

641
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,070
don't double weight or double pivot or
have your line of gravity between your

642
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
have your line of gravity between your
 

643
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,230
have your line of gravity between your
two elements of your basic support okay

644
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,240
two elements of your basic support okay
 

645
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,390
two elements of your basic support okay
so for example uh obvious one uh would

646
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
so for example uh obvious one uh would
 

647
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,350
so for example uh obvious one uh would
be a yashi count to shift to the Y phase

648
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,360
be a yashi count to shift to the Y phase
