00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:36,030

Federation so I give my you grab be

strong so always remember that the

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,869
strong so always remember that the
energy I'm talking about is not the

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
energy I'm talking about is not the
 

9
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,549
energy I'm talking about is not the
physical power it's the internal power

10
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:45,559
physical power it's the internal power
 

11
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,990
physical power it's the internal power
keep

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000

 

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,830

tur I'm moving Toe to Toe as I'm turning

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
tur I'm moving Toe to Toe as I'm turning
 

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,110
tur I'm moving Toe to Toe as I'm turning
my body it's not a movement

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
my body it's not a movement
 

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,510
my body it's not a movement
I move around my

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520

 

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,910

Center I'm

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:12,920

 

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,749

180 for instance if I'm in this position

22
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
180 for instance if I'm in this position
 

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,630
180 for instance if I'm in this position
here push so this shouldn't

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:19,640
here push so this shouldn't
 

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,310
here push so this shouldn't
happen if he's pushing he's pushing so I

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,320
happen if he's pushing he's pushing so I
 

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,870
happen if he's pushing he's pushing so I
have a stable position in uh

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880

 

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,670

so if he's

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:32,680
so if he's
 

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,270
so if he's
pulling this should not

32
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
pulling this should not
 

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,910
pulling this should not
happen if he's pulling stop if he's

34
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:38,920
happen if he's pulling stop if he's
 

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,469
happen if he's pulling stop if he's
pushing this should not happen I have to

36
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
pushing this should not happen I have to
 

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,630
pushing this should not happen I have to
have a stable

38
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:43,640
have a stable
 

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,950
have a stable
position now my body is strong and ready

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:47,960
position now my body is strong and ready
 

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:02:00,950
position now my body is strong and ready
to move on has to be hey bring it out

42
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960

 

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,590

so so this is no energy coming

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
so so this is no energy coming
 

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,830
so so this is no energy coming
out

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:10,840

 

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,630

hey that is bringing the energy out

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640
hey that is bringing the energy out
 

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,990
hey that is bringing the energy out

watch now I'm stepping into the same

90
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,080
watch now I'm stepping into the same
 

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,110
watch now I'm stepping into the same
position as I was in before here

92
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
position as I was in before here
 

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,270

grabbing same hand as was a stronger

94
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
grabbing same hand as was a stronger
 

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,789
grabbing same hand as was a stronger
hand before is still the stronger hand

96
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:43,799
hand before is still the stronger hand
 

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,229
hand before is still the stronger hand
but I have to grab myself this

98
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,239
but I have to grab myself this
 

99
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,750
but I have to grab myself this
way

100
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
way
 

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,149
way
move turn use both hands because that is

102
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:55,159
move turn use both hands because that is
 

103
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,149
move turn use both hands because that is
stronger and it's easier to Center the

104
00:03:59,149 --> 00:03:59,159
stronger and it's easier to Center the
 

105
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,509
stronger and it's easier to Center the
movement

106
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519

 

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,509

that kind of motion as well but it's

108
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:10,519
that kind of motion as well but it's
 

109
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,589
that kind of motion as well but it's
important

110
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
important
 

111
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,229
important
that stepping

112
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239

 

113
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,349

in my point

114
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
in my point
 

115
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,509
in my point
is never

116
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
is never
 

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,990
is never
attack with the intention to take the

118
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
attack with the intention to take the
 

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,030
attack with the intention to take the
uky we blend

120
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,040
uky we blend
 

121
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:44,830
uky we blend
it because

122
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:44,840

 

123
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:52,710

can immediately get up and attack me

124
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720

 

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,550

again and we

126
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
again and we
 

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,029
again and we
moved this way

128
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:00,039

 

129
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,550

so three ways moving we were doing the

130
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
so three ways moving we were doing the
 

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,950
so three ways moving we were doing the
forms we were doing the form we were

132
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
forms we were doing the form we were
 

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,510
forms we were doing the form we were
doing moving this Chang to the other H

134
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
doing moving this Chang to the other H
 

135
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,870
doing moving this Chang to the other H
so there are

136
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:15,880
so there are
 

137
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,590
so there are
many details

138
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
many details
 

139
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,870
many details
involve

140
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
involve
 

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,270
involve
one is this

142
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
one is this
 

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,390
one is this
mov as he grabs

144
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,400

 

145
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,790

because this is a strong

146
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800

 

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,230

movement don't Mo so I just move my sens

148
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
movement don't Mo so I just move my sens
 

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,590
movement don't Mo so I just move my sens
just a little bit and I can easily bring

150
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,600
just a little bit and I can easily bring
 

151
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,670
just a little bit and I can easily bring
him

152
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
him
 

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,070
him
off if I'm trying to take a step here I

154
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,080
off if I'm trying to take a step here I
 

155
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,150
off if I'm trying to take a step here I
will get Stu so therefore like this and

156
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
will get Stu so therefore like this and
 

157
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,790
will get Stu so therefore like this and
in the attack

158
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
in the attack
 

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,469
in the attack
form then
