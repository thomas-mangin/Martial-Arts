1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,710

okay so now we have those combination of

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:05,720
okay so now we have those combination of
 

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,270
okay so now we have those combination of
c and iy and we're going to start

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,280
c and iy and we're going to start
 

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,910
c and iy and we're going to start
bringing it a little closer to the kihon

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
bringing it a little closer to the kihon
 

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,990
bringing it a little closer to the kihon
so iido the way that we use the C and II

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
so iido the way that we use the C and II
 

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,349
so iido the way that we use the C and II
is either on the inward spiral or on the

10
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
is either on the inward spiral or on the
 

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,429
is either on the inward spiral or on the
outward spiral and again the reason why

12
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
outward spiral and again the reason why
 

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,390
outward spiral and again the reason why
I only have those two is because I got a

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:23,400
I only have those two is because I got a
 

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,910
I only have those two is because I got a
spiral rotate my lower to den and the

16
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
spiral rotate my lower to den and the
 

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,470
spiral rotate my lower to den and the
hands are what moves

18
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
hands are what moves
 

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,830
hands are what moves
the lower tonen it's not it's not I

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
the lower tonen it's not it's not I
 

21
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,549
the lower tonen it's not it's not I
don't ever use my waist I don't do that

22
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
don't ever use my waist I don't do that
 

23
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,430
don't ever use my waist I don't do that
okay so you have to have your Palm Point

24
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
okay so you have to have your Palm Point
 

25
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,069
okay so you have to have your Palm Point
as we mentioned okay and the first one

26
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:43,079
as we mentioned okay and the first one
 

27
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,990
as we mentioned okay and the first one
will'll do a Coq projection this time I

28
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
will'll do a Coq projection this time I
 

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,229
will'll do a Coq projection this time I
won't just do it wherever I am going to

30
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,239
won't just do it wherever I am going to
 

31
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,470
won't just do it wherever I am going to
aim it in his Center

32

okay and we won't let him let

34
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:54,199
okay and we won't let him let
 

35
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,509
okay and we won't let him let
go okay so you have one C you and now

36
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:58,519
go okay so you have one C you and now
 

37
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:01,590
go okay so you have one C you and now
you're going to use that GR grip in the

38
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
you're going to use that GR grip in the
 

39
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,869
you're going to use that GR grip in the
in the I key you you have to use the

40
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:03,879
in the I key you you have to use the
 

41
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,510
in the I key you you have to use the
grip in the I key move his Center to get

42
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
grip in the I key move his Center to get
 

43
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,190
grip in the I key move his Center to get
the other spiral so it's not that I tilt

44
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,200
the other spiral so it's not that I tilt
 

45
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,069
the other spiral so it's not that I tilt
him and then he comes back and I turn
