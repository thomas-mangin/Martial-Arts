so avoid his strengths

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599

people tend to just practice those
things and so

16
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
things and so
 

17
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,269

so i came in
pull up boom

190
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
pull up boom
 

191
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,830
pull up boom
over this way okay back in the head with

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,070
okay let's try okay so these kicks are
i'm going to call them displacing

212
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
i'm going to call them displacing
 

213
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,909
i'm going to call them displacing
kicks and they're different from

214
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
kicks and they're different from

trying to do is
 

223
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,830
trying to do is
deconstruct so

224
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
deconstruct so
 

225
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,629
deconstruct so
i have a line here and there's a hinge

226
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
i have a line here and there's a hinge
 

227
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,830
i have a line here and there's a hinge
there

228
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840

okay
 

289
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,110
okay
and now you can do more things because

290
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
and now you can do more things because
 

291
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,790
and now you can do more things because
he has to recover his balance

292
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
he has to recover his balance
 

293
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,830
he has to recover his balance
okay displacing go

294
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
okay displacing go
 

295
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,469
okay displacing go
okay so that would work off that grab so

296
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
okay so that would work off that grab so
 

297
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,189
okay so that would work off that grab so
he's coming

298
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
he's coming
 

299
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,469
he's coming
in boom and i'm gonna move uh with

300
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
in boom and i'm gonna move uh with
 

301
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,150
in boom and i'm gonna move uh with
uh not pulling on this

302
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
uh not pulling on this
 

303
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,710
uh not pulling on this
okay in other words so when he goes to

304
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
okay in other words so when he goes to
 

305
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,710
okay in other words so when he goes to
grab

306
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
grab
 

307
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,550
grab
yeah you move forward by your pulling

308
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
yeah you move forward by your pulling
 

309
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,990
yeah you move forward by your pulling
knife the trick

310
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
knife the trick
 

311
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,870
knife the trick
is is as you feel him go you just move

is is as you feel him go you just move
it

314
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
it
 

315
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,950
it
into it okay so it goes dead on him

316
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
into it okay so it goes dead on him
 

317
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,749
into it okay so it goes dead on him
he should feel like he just grabbed air

318
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
he should feel like he just grabbed air
 

319
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,469
he should feel like he just grabbed air
so

320
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
so
 

321
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:56,830
so
whoa

322
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840

 

323
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,710

oh so

324
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
oh so
 

325
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,029
oh so
neutralize pull

326
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
neutralize pull
 

327
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,629
neutralize pull
and then your strike hits the back of

328
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
and then your strike hits the back of
 

329

337
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,150

neutralize bloom then turn the head

338
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160

 

339
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:12,990

turn the hat

340
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,000
