00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
hello i'm christopher hine and today
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,869
hello i'm christopher hine and today
we're going to be talking about uh sorry

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
we're going to be talking about uh sorry
 

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,310
we're going to be talking about uh sorry
still still working on the intro and it

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
still still working on the intro and it
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,990
still still working on the intro and it
gets me every time today we're going to

8
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
gets me every time today we're going to
 

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,589
gets me every time today we're going to
be talking a little more about the

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
be talking a little more about the
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,110
be talking a little more about the
internal power thing and uh today we're

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
internal power thing and uh today we're
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,790
internal power thing and uh today we're
going to talk about connecting to force

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
going to talk about connecting to force
 

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,830
going to talk about connecting to force
so what it is to connect to force um

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
so what it is to connect to force um
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,349
so what it is to connect to force um
there's lots of little subtle ways that

18
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
there's lots of little subtle ways that
 

19
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,550
there's lots of little subtle ways that
this happen

20
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
this happen
 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,630
this happen
understand if you can connect to

22
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
understand if you can connect to
 

23
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,509
understand if you can connect to
whatever's making the force you will

24
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
whatever's making the force you will
 

25
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,669
whatever's making the force you will
seem much stronger because

26
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
seem much stronger because
 

27
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,229
seem much stronger because
the act of putting force into you will

28
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
the act of putting force into you will
 

29
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,150
the act of putting force into you will
disrupt what is forcing you and so

30
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
disrupt what is forcing you and so
 

31
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,069
disrupt what is forcing you and so
then that will make the force weaker and

32
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
then that will make the force weaker and
 

33
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,830
then that will make the force weaker and
you are attached to the stability of the

34
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
you are attached to the stability of the
 

35
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,069
you are attached to the stability of the
force and the force needs its own

36
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
force and the force needs its own
 

37
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,470
force and the force needs its own
stability in order to move you so it

38
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
stability in order to move you so it
 

39
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,310
stability in order to move you so it
gets crazy real quick so i'm going to

40
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
gets crazy real quick so i'm going to
 

41
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,910
gets crazy real quick so i'm going to
show you a couple ways that that happens

42
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
show you a couple ways that that happens
 

43
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,229
show you a couple ways that that happens
today i think this is a pretty deceptive

44
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
today i think this is a pretty deceptive
 

45
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,790
today i think this is a pretty deceptive
one most everything happens with

46
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
one most everything happens with
 

47
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,630
one most everything happens with
leverage and force angle which are the

48
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
leverage and force angle which are the
 

49
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,549
leverage and force angle which are the
first two i covered this is another one

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
first two i covered this is another one
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,950
first two i covered this is another one
that really does end up using leverage

52
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
that really does end up using leverage
 

53
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,670
that really does end up using leverage
and force angle in in in a few ways but

54
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
and force angle in in in a few ways but
 

55
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,430
and force angle in in in a few ways but
actually connecting to the force is a

56
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
actually connecting to the force is a
 

57
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,549
actually connecting to the force is a
different principle and there's lots of

58
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
different principle and there's lots of
 

59
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,230
different principle and there's lots of
cool ways we can use that so i'm going

60
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
cool ways we can use that so i'm going
 

61
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,270
cool ways we can use that so i'm going
to talk about that today i'm going to

62
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
to talk about that today i'm going to
 

63
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,469
to talk about that today i'm going to
get josh over here we're going to go to

these things that i'm showing you

84
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
these things that i'm showing you
 

85
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,109
these things that i'm showing you
they're principles that can be used i

86
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
they're principles that can be used i
 

87
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,030
they're principles that can be used i
feel like a lot of times they're used a

88
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
feel like a lot of times they're used a
 

89
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,030
feel like a lot of times they're used a
little nefariously and and people are

90
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
little nefariously and and people are
 

91
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,190
little nefariously and and people are
using them to deceive other people and

92
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
using them to deceive other people and
 

93
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,789
using them to deceive other people and
make people think that you know they

94
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
make people think that you know they
 

95
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,950
make people think that you know they
have powers that they don't have

96
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
have powers that they don't have
 

97
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,310

it's accessible to you right now right
 

103
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,350
it's accessible to you right now right
so if you understand the demonstrations

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
so if you understand the demonstrations
 

105
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,030
so if you understand the demonstrations
i'm giving you can do these things right

106
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
i'm giving you can do these things right
 

107
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,910
i'm giving you can do these things right
now

108
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
now
 

109
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,350
now
there's a little bit of skill that can

110
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
there's a little bit of skill that can
 

111
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,870
there's a little bit of skill that can
be built with them that you know you can

112
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
be built with them that you know you can
 

113
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,310
be built with them that you know you can
use them

114
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
use them
 

115
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,389
use them
a little better as you practice them

116
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
a little better as you practice them
 

117
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,230
a little better as you practice them
more and also you know once you

118
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
more and also you know once you
 

119
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,910
more and also you know once you
understand the principle you can apply

120
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
understand the principle you can apply
 

121
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,589
understand the principle you can apply
that principle to

122
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
that principle to
 

123
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,510
that principle to
situations that are of martial context

124
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
situations that are of martial context
 

125
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,470
situations that are of martial context
but

126
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
but
 

127
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,630
but
most of these things are already at play

128
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
most of these things are already at play
 

129
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,150
most of these things are already at play
right so when you see sport martial

130
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
right so when you see sport martial
 

131
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,309
right so when you see sport martial
artists fighting in the mma ring they're

132
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
artists fighting in the mma ring they're
 

133
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,830
artists fighting in the mma ring they're
not unaware of these things they might

134
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
not unaware of these things they might
 

135
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,510
not unaware of these things they might
not understand them on an intellectual

136
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
not understand them on an intellectual
 

137
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,190
not understand them on an intellectual
level but they are unconsciously using

138
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
level but they are unconsciously using
 

139
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,430
level but they are unconsciously using
these things all the time right so

140
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
these things all the time right so
 

141
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,390
these things all the time right so
okay the one we're gonna talk about

142
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
okay the one we're gonna talk about
 

143
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,910
okay the one we're gonna talk about
today is connecting to force or

144
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
today is connecting to force or
 

145
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,350
today is connecting to force or
sometimes i say connecting to force

146
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
sometimes i say connecting to force
 

147
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,949
sometimes i say connecting to force
structure because that's what you're

148
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
structure because that's what you're
 

149
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,710
structure because that's what you're
doing you're connecting to the structure

150
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
doing you're connecting to the structure
 

151
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,990
doing you're connecting to the structure
that's making the force right um these

152
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
that's making the force right um these
 

153
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
that's making the force right um these
two things i'm going to show are really

154
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
two things i'm going to show are really
 

155
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,070
two things i'm going to show are really
highly into the the tricky area so i'm

156
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
highly into the the tricky area so i'm
 

157
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,350
highly into the the tricky area so i'm
going to show you two real tricky

158
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
going to show you two real tricky
 

159
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,350
going to show you two real tricky
versions and then i'm going to show you

160
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
versions and then i'm going to show you
 

161
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,270
versions and then i'm going to show you
a regular version that's used in

162
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
a regular version that's used in
 

163
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,949
a regular version that's used in
wrestling all the time right so

164
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
wrestling all the time right so
 

165
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,750
wrestling all the time right so
constantly used in wrestling okay so uh

166
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
constantly used in wrestling okay so uh
 

167
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,830
constantly used in wrestling okay so uh
before i showed you how with force angle

168
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
before i showed you how with force angle
 

169
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,270
before i showed you how with force angle
we could give you the deception that if

170
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
we could give you the deception that if
 

171
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,869
we could give you the deception that if

than me does that and he tries to push

176
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
than me does that and he tries to push
 

177
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,350
than me does that and he tries to push
me over and i change the direction of

me over and i change the direction of
 

179
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,190
me over and i change the direction of
his force angle all of a sudden i seem

180
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
his force angle all of a sudden i seem
 

181
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,790
his force angle all of a sudden i seem
real strong and stand on one leg and all

182

real strong and stand on one leg and all
 

183
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,149
real strong and stand on one leg and all
this kind of stuff right so that's

184
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
this kind of stuff right so that's
 

185
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,910
this kind of stuff right so that's
because i'm i'm going at a different

186
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
because i'm i'm going at a different
 

187
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,509
because i'm i'm going at a different
angle to his force that's distracting

188
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
angle to his force that's distracting
 

189
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,430
angle to his force that's distracting
his force and doing all kinds of kinds

190
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
his force and doing all kinds of kinds
 

191
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,030
his force and doing all kinds of kinds
of cool stuff there's another way i can

192
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
of cool stuff there's another way i can
 

193
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,070
of cool stuff there's another way i can
do that that seems like maybe i've i

194
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
do that that seems like maybe i've i
 

195
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,470
do that that seems like maybe i've i
it's impossible to do what i just did so

196
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
it's impossible to do what i just did so
 

197
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,990
it's impossible to do what i just did so
if josh put his hands on my shoulders

198
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
if josh put his hands on my shoulders
 

199
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,670
if josh put his hands on my shoulders
right and josh goes to push into me he's

200
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
right and josh goes to push into me he's
 

201
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,110
right and josh goes to push into me he's
going to push real strong okay now josh

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
going to push real strong okay now josh
 

203
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,869
going to push real strong okay now josh

look at josh is starting to fall over

206
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
look at josh is starting to fall over
 

207
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,030
look at josh is starting to fall over
but i'm not i'm i'm stable on one leg so

208
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
but i'm not i'm i'm stable on one leg so
 

209
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,270
but i'm not i'm i'm stable on one leg so
how am i doing it i'm doing a very

210
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
how am i doing it i'm doing a very
 

211
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,110
how am i doing it i'm doing a very
similar thing and the way i'm doing is

212
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
similar thing and the way i'm doing is
 

213
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,750
similar thing and the way i'm doing is
i'm connecting to him right and so i'll

214
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
i'm connecting to him right and so i'll
 

215
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,910
i'm connecting to him right and so i'll
get all the advantages of force

216
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
get all the advantages of force
 

217
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,070
get all the advantages of force
angle plus i'll kind of get some of

218
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
angle plus i'll kind of get some of
 

219
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,830
angle plus i'll kind of get some of
these advantages of the connecting to

220
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
these advantages of the connecting to
 

221
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,670
these advantages of the connecting to
force structure so when he pushes into

222
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
force structure so when he pushes into
 

223
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,190
force structure so when he pushes into
me all i do is i put my hand up

224
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
me all i do is i put my hand up
 

225
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,270
me all i do is i put my hand up
underneath his arm right here so when he

226
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
underneath his arm right here so when he
 

227
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,110
underneath his arm right here so when he
when josh pushes into me this is what

228
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
when josh pushes into me this is what
 

229
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,270
when josh pushes into me this is what
happens to me as he pushes me right

230
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
happens to me as he pushes me right
 

231
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,430
happens to me as he pushes me right
so when he does that he's now pushing

232
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
so when he does that he's now pushing
 

233
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,949
so when he does that he's now pushing
into himself and you see him like as he

234
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
into himself and you see him like as he
 

235
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,710
into himself and you see him like as he
pushes real hard he'll start to lose

236
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
pushes real hard he'll start to lose
 

237
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,789
pushes real hard he'll start to lose
balance and all kinds of stuff because

238
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
balance and all kinds of stuff because
 

239
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,190
balance and all kinds of stuff because
i'm connecting to him so he's actually

240
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
i'm connecting to him so he's actually
 

241
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,229
i'm connecting to him so he's actually
disrupting his own balance by pushing

242
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
disrupting his own balance by pushing
 

243
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,630
disrupting his own balance by pushing
into me so he's using his own force to

244
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
into me so he's using his own force to
 

245
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,710
into me so he's using his own force to
destroy his own balance right

246
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
destroy his own balance right
 

247
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,309
destroy his own balance right
and i am borrowing from that because i'm

248
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
and i am borrowing from that because i'm
 

249
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,949
and i am borrowing from that because i'm
connected to him so i do have to have

250
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
connected to him so i do have to have
 

251
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,110
connected to him so i do have to have
somewhat of a strong arm to connect to

252
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
somewhat of a strong arm to connect to
 

253
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,110
somewhat of a strong arm to connect to
that but once i do that i'm really

254
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
that but once i do that i'm really
 

255
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,110
that but once i do that i'm really
really in a stable position now this is

256
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
really in a stable position now this is
 

257
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,189
really in a stable position now this is
used deceptively all the time there was

258
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
used deceptively all the time there was
 

259
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,349
used deceptively all the time there was
a video that circled around maybe eight

260
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
a video that circled around maybe eight
 

261
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,670
a video that circled around maybe eight
nine years ago that was a internal

262
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
nine years ago that was a internal
 

263
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,510
nine years ago that was a internal
martial art master and he had this

264
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
martial art master and he had this
 

265
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,430
martial art master and he had this
really big power lifter guy trying to

266
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
really big power lifter guy trying to
 

267
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,790
really big power lifter guy trying to
push him around and the power lifter

268
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
push him around and the power lifter
 

269
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,710
push him around and the power lifter
couldn't push him and all the people who

270
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
couldn't push him and all the people who
 

271
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,710
couldn't push him and all the people who
are into internal power were saying like

272
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
are into internal power were saying like
 

273
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,390
are into internal power were saying like
oh see this is real proof here because

274
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
oh see this is real proof here because
 

275
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,830
oh see this is real proof here because
that guy's a real strong guy and he

276
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
that guy's a real strong guy and he
 

277
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,830
that guy's a real strong guy and he
can't push him over and i told them all

278
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
can't push him over and i told them all
 

279
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,230
can't push him over and i told them all
that it was this and they said oh no

280
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
that it was this and they said oh no
 

281
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,909
that it was this and they said oh no
it's not so i made him a video

282
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
it's not so i made him a video
 

283
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,150
it's not so i made him a video
explaining this and they said oh it's

284
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
explaining this and they said oh it's
 

285
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,870
explaining this and they said oh it's
not that and then i took the video and i

286
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
not that and then i took the video and i
 

287
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,629
not that and then i took the video and i
circled where the guy was doing it and

288
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
circled where the guy was doing it and
 

289
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,390
circled where the guy was doing it and
they said oh it's not that and so it's

290
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
they said oh it's not that and so it's
 

291
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,390
they said oh it's not that and so it's
like you know at a certain point people

292
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
like you know at a certain point people
 

293
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,749
like you know at a certain point people
just will believe whatever they want to

294
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
just will believe whatever they want to
 

295
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,510
just will believe whatever they want to
believe but this is a way you can show

296
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
believe but this is a way you can show
 

297
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,870
believe but this is a way you can show
that and it's just connecting to force

298
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
that and it's just connecting to force
 

299
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,230
that and it's just connecting to force
structure and that's a deceptive way you

300
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
structure and that's a deceptive way you
 

301
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,310
structure and that's a deceptive way you
can show it okay another way you can

302
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
can show it okay another way you can
 

303
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,310
can show it okay another way you can
show it is and real quick i'm just going

304
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
show it is and real quick i'm just going
 

305
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,469
show it is and real quick i'm just going
to prove so if i want to pick up josh i

306
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
to prove so if i want to pick up josh i
 

307

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
can pick him up right okay so no big
 

309
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,550
can pick him up right okay so no big
deal i can totally get him up now when i

310
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
deal i can totally get him up now when i
 

311
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,990
deal i can totally get him up now when i
go to pick up josh josh going to put his

so that's a demonstration that can be
 

377
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,430
so that's a demonstration that can be
done and then i of course explain to all

378

done and then i of course explain to all
 

379
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,110
done and then i of course explain to all
my students immediately how that works i

so there's nothing illegitimate about

388
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
so there's nothing illegitimate about
 

389
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,150
so there's nothing illegitimate about
the fact that that is something that

390
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
the fact that that is something that
 

391
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
the fact that that is something that
does happen and that's a way you can use

392
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
does happen and that's a way you can use
 

393
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,710
does happen and that's a way you can use
that and i'll show you right now how

394
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
that and i'll show you right now how
 

395
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,950
that and i'll show you right now how
it's done legitimately all the time but

396
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
it's done legitimately all the time but
 

397
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,189
it's done legitimately all the time but
it seems like that shouldn't be possible

398
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
it seems like that shouldn't be possible
 

399
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,150
it seems like that shouldn't be possible
it seems like that's something

400
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
it seems like that's something
 

401
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,670

mysterious power they're just connecting
 

405
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,590
mysterious power they're just connecting
to the structure of the force right okay

406
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
to the structure of the force right okay
 

407
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,670
to the structure of the force right okay
now here's a way that this is used in

to me so he connected to the structure
 

427
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,990
to me so he connected to the structure
that's making the force and so it makes

428
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
that's making the force and so it makes
 

429
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,510

leverage is going to be the vast

484
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
leverage is going to be the vast
 

485
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,990

majority of it there's some kind of
 

487
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,990
majority of it there's some kind of
mechanical advantage going on leverage

488
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
mechanical advantage going on leverage
 

489
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,110
mechanical advantage going on leverage
is definitely something you need to know

490
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
is definitely something you need to know
 

491
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,950

something else is going on other than
 

497
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,469
something else is going on other than
leverage right then force angle is

498
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
leverage right then force angle is
 

499
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,909
leverage right then force angle is
another really deceptive one that can

500
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
another really deceptive one that can
 

501

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,110
millions of dollars at the turn of the
century showing force angle stuff so

508
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
century showing force angle stuff so
 

509
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,430
century showing force angle stuff so
that is really deceptive but again just

510
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
that is really deceptive but again just
 

511
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,110
that is really deceptive but again just

if someone selling it is something other
than force angle they're probably trying
