1
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,718
I started practicing Aikido in April 1978.

2
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,261
I was 22 years old.

3
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,805
I liked Budo

4
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:27,731
so I wanted to practice it, something like either Kendo or Judo.

5
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:36,573
As it happened, one of my friends who was doing Aikido invited me to have a look at a class.

6
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,908
That is the only reason really.

7
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:47,334
I started Aikido Kyoto about 10 years ago, it will be 11 years this year.

8
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,961
The Nishijin Dojo was established 6 years ago.

9
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:00,138
I haven't really faced any particular difficulties, really.

10
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:10,741
However, before even starting to talk about Aikido, I did face obstacles because I am Japanese, and I am a woman.

11
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,700
But rather than difficulties, I would say that these were more like social prejudices.

12
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,496
So within Aikido itself, I did not experience any particular difficulties.

13
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:35,000
I would say that Aikido as an art is very impartial and equalitarian. 

14
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:41,680
I actually reckon that there are more advantages than difficulties.

15
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,954
In my teaching, the techniques are basically the same.

16
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,831
That being said there are some differences,

17
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,249
some people are tall, some are short,

18
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,210
some are big, some are small,

19
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,379
there are children, adults, etc.

20
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:54,062
This is why I think that a technique should work and make sense for everybody.

21
00:05:54,271 --> 00:06:05,282
But of course, there are some elements of a technique that must be changed while others that have to remain the same.

22
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:11,705
If the partner changes something, we have to change accordingly.

23
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:26,761
That is why I think that form is not something that should be used to fit something into a specific shape, but that there should be some level of flexibility. 

24
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,267
This is a very difficult question.

25
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:38,189
Basically, I practiced at Hombu Dojo with many Sensei.

26
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,070
I received from many of the Sensei there, including of course Ueshiba Kisshomau Doshu.

27
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:52,078
In France, I learnt from Christian Tissier Sensei who had also studied at Hombu.

28
00:06:53,747 --> 00:07:00,128
I learnt from all those people.

29
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:12,599
I processed all of that and I decided to teach the product of that reflection to other people.

30
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,020
My main influence is Yamaguchi Sensei.

31
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,189
After that, it is Tissier Sensei, 

32
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,107
and then Shibata Sensei.

33
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:36,957
It is up to you to practice basics daily at your own dojo.

34
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:43,129
According to the kind of keiko you do, your perception will improve and that will again change the way you train.

35
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:50,345
There are people who only perceive the form because they have not been really educated.

36
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:58,478
Consequently, they only know to mimic the form of their teachers.

37
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:10,073
Of course sometimes, learning to some extent involves copying,

38
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:24,421
but not seeing only what can be seen, training is to learn to see what is not visible, and the role of the instruction is to guide in this process.

39
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:33,138
You have to train yourself to perceive what can't be seen.

40
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:39,519
Aikido is a budo that helps to cultivate this sort of insight.

41
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,442
I really think so.

42
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:51,114
The reason is that for all sports professionals, beyond the competition,

43
00:08:51,656 --> 00:09:01,666
it is the dedicated, every day personal training that occupies most of the time,

44
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:09,007
so I think that daily training is the most important.

45
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:17,974
I mainly do some stretching and sometimes suburi, that is all.

46
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:35,784
I have to keep a daily routine, take care of my health, eat good food, take care of my body, and avoid wasting energy.

47
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,667
At Aikido Kyoto, we practice weapons 2h every week.

48
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,795
There are 2 classes.

49
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:57,138
Weapons training is very helpful in order to deepen one's study of Aikido.

50
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:02,560
Personally however, I don't see myself as a kenjutsu-ka,

51
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,357
I am have not reached a level where I am aiming at mastering the weapons.

52
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:16,616
However, I am doing this study because it helps my Aikido with elements such as distance and timing.

53
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:23,581
At that time when I started, Masuda Sensei was sometimes teaching tanto-dori

54
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:34,926
and I also used to take special weapons classes twice per week with Shibata Sensei, learning Aiki-ken and Aiki-jo.

55
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:42,600
When I got to America, I also did weapons at the Birankai with Chiba Sensei.

56
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:56,865
Before they reach sandan or yondan, students should develop a good eye to perceive the essence of Aikido.

57
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,911
It is our responsibility to helps them achieve this.

58
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,586
We have a kenshusei program at Aikido Kyoto.

59
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:16,801
This program is for those who want to become Aikido teachers,

60
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,096
either professionally or semi-professionally,

61
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:25,143
for anyone who wants to teach at some point.

62
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,021
For me, these people must undergo specific training.

63
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:34,819
The reason is that if one does Aikido only for oneself, it won't benefit anybody.

64
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,656
If one becomes a teacher, one will affect the lives of others.

65
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:50,293
This is why it requires special coaching.

66
00:11:50,793 --> 00:12:01,346
This program is for the people who want to share Aikido, but it is not an obligation to become a teacher.

67
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:11,564
The kenshusei program is very time-demanding but also hard phsyically so some sometimes quit because of that.

68
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:20,365
Right now I have 5 kenshusei and 3 of them are foreigners.

69
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:35,255
In Japan budo dojos have in general a somewhat old-fashioned image.

70
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:41,135
I think that Aikido Kyoto has to follow and adapt according to the time we are living in.

71
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:47,433
This is the same for other arts such as Tea ceremony and Kabuki theater as well.

72
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:58,820
There are elements that must not be changed, but other things need adapt to the changes of the times. It is important to keep this balance.

73
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:05,326
I want to do the same for Budo, remove the old-fashioned image without loosing the essence.

74
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,833
It has to stay a Budo, so it must retain some severity.

75
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:21,355
The main thing is that I want people to find enjoyment and pleasure while they are here.

76
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:31,032
After they leave, I want them to think about and understand why the training was nice was and pleasant.

77
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,849
We're travelling light

78
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,399
Should I look towards Guillaume?
