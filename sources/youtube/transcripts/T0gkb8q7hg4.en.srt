00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
oh really the wrist grabs are about uh
 

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,189
oh really the wrist grabs are about uh
you know a couple of things that are key

18
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
you know a couple of things that are key
 

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,910
you know a couple of things that are key
i think that you have um

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
i think that you have um
 

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,310
i think that you have um

okay so uh when we're doing the

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
okay so uh when we're doing the
 

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,109
okay so uh when we're doing the
technique it i look relaxed but he's

26
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
technique it i look relaxed but he's
 

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,270
technique it i look relaxed but he's
pushing you can really drive drive drive

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
pushing you can really drive drive drive
 

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,789
pushing you can really drive drive drive
drive i'm just relaxed you can stand up

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

 

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,630

i do the technique

32
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
i do the technique
 

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,109
i do the technique
again he's pushing it's really stand up

34
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
again he's pushing it's really stand up
 

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,630
again he's pushing it's really stand up
again

36
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
again
 

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,950
again
it's a lot of energy he's giving so that

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
it's a lot of energy he's giving so that
 

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,109
it's a lot of energy he's giving so that
you could see all right so you are

40
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
you could see all right so you are
 

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,069
you could see all right so you are
working on that

42
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
working on that
 

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,190
working on that
but the wrist grabs

44
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
but the wrist grabs
 

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,990
but the wrist grabs
i find are more about sagittal integrity

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
i find are more about sagittal integrity
 

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,950
i find are more about sagittal integrity
of your

48
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
of your
 

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,590
of your
center so remember center

50
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
center so remember center
 

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,389
center so remember center
is a interdependent relationship between

52
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
is a interdependent relationship between
 

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,230
is a interdependent relationship between
my extremities

54
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
my extremities
 

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,149
my extremities
and my tan den

56
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
and my tan den
 

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,789
and my tan den
so if my tonsil is

58
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
so if my tonsil is
 

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,429
so if my tonsil is
moving in space sagittally

60
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
moving in space sagittally
 

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,469
moving in space sagittally
it just

62
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
it just
 

63
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,109
it just
it's not gonna work okay it's gonna move

64
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
it's not gonna work okay it's gonna move
 

65
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,350
it's not gonna work okay it's gonna move
in front of my four corners or behind my

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
in front of my four corners or behind my
 

67
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,069
in front of my four corners or behind my
four corners doesn't work

68
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
four corners doesn't work
 

69
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,429

um

70
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
um
 

71
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,870
um
so when you do it

they're checking
 

93
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,750
they're checking
if you were doing katanta dodi right

94
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
if you were doing katanta dodi right
 

95
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,910
if you were doing katanta dodi right
you did have the other

96
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
you did have the other
 

97
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,150
you did have the other
corners organized and in that

98

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
so we're here and he takes that away and
 

107
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,190
so we're here and he takes that away and
he's he's driving that side stays fine

108
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
he's he's driving that side stays fine
 

109
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,509
he's he's driving that side stays fine
just like it's here it stays fine so i

110
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
just like it's here it stays fine so i
 

111
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,030
just like it's here it stays fine so i
move

uh

180
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
uh
 

181
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,749
uh
but we'll

182
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
but we'll
 

183
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,270
but we'll
make some points

184
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
make some points
 

185
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,230
make some points
so

186
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
so
 

187
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,670
so
i'm whatever i do with this hand it can

188
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
i'm whatever i do with this hand it can
 

189
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,909
i'm whatever i do with this hand it can
only do inward spiral

00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
only do inward spiral
 

191
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,469
only do inward spiral
outward spirals okay so if you pay

192
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
outward spirals okay so if you pay
 

193
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,469
outward spirals okay so if you pay
attention when i do the first part it's

194
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
attention when i do the first part it's
 

195
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,310
attention when i do the first part it's
doing the inward this one's doing the

196
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
doing the inward this one's doing the
 

197
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,550
doing the inward this one's doing the
outward and then they switch rolls

198
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560

 

199
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,550

so even here it's not doing nothing

200
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
so even here it's not doing nothing
 

201
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,990

if you trained in other arts you would

306
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,080
if you trained in other arts you would
 

307
