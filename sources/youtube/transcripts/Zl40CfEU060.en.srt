um it's
 

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,029
um it's
components okay that go

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
components okay that go
 

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,189
components okay that go
into the

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
into the
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,349
into the
khole so I don't consider this a

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359
khole so I don't consider this a
 

15
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,630
khole so I don't consider this a
pin okay because he can roll out he can

16
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:25,640
pin okay because he can roll out he can
 

17
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,230
pin okay because he can roll out he can
because basically it's a

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
because basically it's a
 

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,669
because basically it's a
Kimura from your nibble

20
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:30,679

understand that so just to make sure
here we go we're going to do the

30
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:43,879
here we go we're going to do the
 

31
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,750
here we go we're going to do the
Cur I just basic Kimura come around and

32
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
Cur I just basic Kimura come around and
 

33
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,830
Cur I just basic Kimura come around and
I don't put my leg on him I go for it

34
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:52,840
I don't put my leg on him I go for it
 

35
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,910
I don't put my leg on him I go for it
and he'll roll out of it

36
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920

 

37
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,470

okay
 

39
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,070
okay
so there is nothing protecting the turn

40
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,080
so there is nothing protecting the turn
 

41
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,710
so there is nothing protecting the turn
you see in

42
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
you see in
 

43
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,870
you see in
K he's going to roll out of it there's

44
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
K he's going to roll out of it there's
 

45
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,390
K he's going to roll out of it there's
nothing stopping that there's not a pit

46
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
nothing stopping that there's not a pit
 

47
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,390
nothing stopping that there's not a pit
okay if you want to stop that you have

48
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
okay if you want to stop that you have
 

49
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,670
okay if you want to stop that you have
to come

50
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
to come
 

51
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,390
to come
into the same kind of position and you

52
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
into the same kind of position and you
 

53
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,749
into the same kind of position and you
have to depost the other arm so here is

54
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
have to depost the other arm so here is
 

55
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,910
have to depost the other arm so here is
the chimur here is depost the other arm

56
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
the chimur here is depost the other arm
 

57
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,910
the chimur here is depost the other arm
arm and the depost arm he tries to turn

58
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
arm and the depost arm he tries to turn
 

59
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,630
arm and the depost arm he tries to turn
he's lends you can go ahead and try this

60
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,640
he's lends you can go ahead and try this
 

61
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,550
he's lends you can go ahead and try this
arm's blocking him from the turn you see

62
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
arm's blocking him from the turn you see
 

63
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,190
arm's blocking him from the turn you see
and so this

64
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,200

 

65
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,789

is a pin

66
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:45,799
is a pin
 

67
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,030
is a pin
okay

68
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,040
okay
 

69
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,870
okay

energy needs it to be okay so you have
 

127
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,789
energy needs it to be okay so you have
some Freedom with

128
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:31,799
some Freedom with
 

129
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,110

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,070
me the next
component is his

134
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
component is his
 

135
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,190

elbow has to
 

137
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,030
elbow has to
be on the front side of my spine so the

138
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
be on the front side of my spine so the
 

139
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,229
be on the front side of my spine so the
nose is marking my spine front means

140
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
nose is marking my spine front means
 

141
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,110
nose is marking my spine front means
head side his elbow has to be on the

142
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,120
head side his elbow has to be on the
 

143
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,910
head side his elbow has to be on the
front side of my spine can't be on the

144
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:54,920
front side of my spine can't be on the
 

145
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,910
front side of my spine can't be on the
back side of my spine if it's on the

146
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
back side of my spine if it's on the
 

147
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,670
back side of my spine if it's on the
back side of my spine this is going to

148
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
back side of my spine this is going to
 

149
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,630
back side of my spine this is going to
going to become a bicep move that means

150
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
going to become a bicep move that means
 

151
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,789
going to become a bicep move that means
my bicep has to be stronger than his

152
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
my bicep has to be stronger than his
 

153
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,949
my bicep has to be stronger than his
extending tricep and that's not going to

154
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
extending tricep and that's not going to
 

155
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,110
extending tricep and that's not going to
happen you're not going to get it

156
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,120

 

157
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,030

got those degrees to work with have some
 

171
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,270
got those degrees to work with have some
sort of angle got it that's wrong and

see how the left shoulder is coming
forward of the right shoulder

344
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120
forward of the right shoulder
 

345
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:07,269
forward of the right shoulder
okay

346
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279

 

347
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,590

the left shoulder coming forward of the

348
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
the left shoulder coming forward of the
 

349
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,790
the left shoulder coming forward of the
right shoulder go ahead get it in place

350
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:11,800
right shoulder go ahead get it in place
 

351
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,230
right shoulder go ahead get it in place
means that she's twisting do you

352
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,240
means that she's twisting do you
 

353
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,829
means that she's twisting do you
understand

354
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
understand
 

355
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,630
understand
okay you will not have the torque you

356
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,640
okay you will not have the torque you
 

357
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,350
okay you will not have the torque you
need for

358
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
need for
 

359
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,150
need for
here go go

360
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
here go go
 

361
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,670
here go go
go go because energy can spill out

362
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:30,680
go go because energy can spill out
 

363
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,150
go go because energy can spill out
you're going to keep trying no matter

364
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
you're going to keep trying no matter
 

365
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,389
you're going to keep trying no matter
how how hard you do do I sound like I'm

366
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
how how hard you do do I sound like I'm
 

367
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,030
how how hard you do do I sound like I'm
trying no I don't okay so you keep

368
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,040
trying no I don't okay so you keep
 

369
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,949
trying no I don't okay so you keep
trying did you burn out already Okay so

370
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:43,959
trying did you burn out already Okay so
 

371
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,670
trying did you burn out already Okay so
this

372
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
this
 

373
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,150
this
way you see

374
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160

 

375
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,949

that so you're down and I'll demonstrate

376
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
that so you're down and I'll demonstrate
 

377
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,670
that so you're down and I'll demonstrate
it just turn and get to the same

378
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:54,680
it just turn and get to the same
 

379
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,750
it just turn and get to the same
position so your body mind recognize

380
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,760
position so your body mind recognize
 

381
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,949
position so your body mind recognize
what we're doing is this the same

382
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959
what we're doing is this the same
 

383
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,590
what we're doing is this the same
position turn your head

384
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,600

 

385
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,230

around and this is where the deviation

386
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,240
around and this is where the deviation
 

387
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,110
around and this is where the deviation
starts do you see if I can't do simple

388
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,120
starts do you see if I can't do simple
 

389
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,990
starts do you see if I can't do simple
things I'm probably not going to do the

390
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
things I'm probably not going to do the
 

391
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,230
things I'm probably not going to do the
technique the same way

392
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,240

 

393
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,790

okay I'm going to do your thing so I'm

394
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:19,800
okay I'm going to do your thing so I'm
 

395
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,790
okay I'm going to do your thing so I'm
much stronger than you right okay but

396
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
much stronger than you right okay but
 

397
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,150
much stronger than you right okay but
I'm going to do your turning thing you

398
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm going to do your turning thing you
 

399
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,350
I'm going to do your turning thing you
got it so I'm going to make this

400
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
got it so I'm going to make this
 

401
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,949
got it so I'm going to make this
shoulder go in front of this shoulder do

402
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
shoulder go in front of this shoulder do
 

403
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,389
shoulder go in front of this shoulder do
you understand okay so so all you're

404
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:29,399
you understand okay so so all you're
 

405
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,829
you understand okay so so all you're
going to do is extend your energy

406
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:32,839
going to do is extend your energy
 

407
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,150
going to do is extend your energy
out keep

408
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160

 

409
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,110

extending there's no way okay so I

410
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
extending there's no way okay so I
 

411
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,550
extending there's no way okay so I
imagine there's someone strong enough

412
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
imagine there's someone strong enough
 

413
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,990
imagine there's someone strong enough
that could get that arm to come around

414
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
that could get that arm to come around
 

415
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,710
that could get that arm to come around
and beat the leverage mechanics but it's

416
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
and beat the leverage mechanics but it's
 

417
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,230
and beat the leverage mechanics but it's
not me okay and I'm much stronger than

418
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
not me okay and I'm much stronger than
 

419
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,710
not me okay and I'm much stronger than
her and then martially

420
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
her and then martially
 

421
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,350
her and then martially
as long as I was taking that's where she

422
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
as long as I was taking that's where she
 

423
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,269
as long as I was taking that's where she
draws a weapon and does all kind of

424
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
draws a weapon and does all kind of
 

425
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,190
draws a weapon and does all kind of
things do you see so in my failure to do

426
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
things do you see so in my failure to do
 

427
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,829
things do you see so in my failure to do
it immediately and

428
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:10,839
it immediately and
 

429
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,550
it immediately and
effortlessly I add time to the technique

430
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
effortlessly I add time to the technique
 

431
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,150
effortlessly I add time to the technique
where that creates openings do you

432
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,160
where that creates openings do you
 

433
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,590
where that creates openings do you
understand but secondarily outp powering

434
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
understand but secondarily outp powering
 

435
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,110
understand but secondarily outp powering
leverage mechanics is not iido that's

436
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
leverage mechanics is not iido that's
 

437
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,670
leverage mechanics is not iido that's
opposite of iido okay so since she has

438
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
opposite of iido okay so since she has
 

439
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,590
opposite of iido okay so since she has
so much extending energy that way you

440
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
so much extending energy that way you
 

441
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,069
so much extending energy that way you
want to take advantage of it and not try

442
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:33,079
want to take advantage of it and not try
 

443
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,670
want to take advantage of it and not try
to make the hand go around the elbow but

444
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:36,680
to make the hand go around the elbow but
 

445
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,870
to make the hand go around the elbow but
just use the hand to help the elbow go

446
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
just use the hand to help the elbow go
 

447
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,310
just use the hand to help the elbow go
this way okay so he's going to come over

448
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
this way okay so he's going to come over
 

449
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,829
this way okay so he's going to come over
here and he's going to duplicate in

450
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
here and he's going to duplicate in
 

451
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,509
here and he's going to duplicate in
energy don't block the camera that's it

452
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:48,519
energy don't block the camera that's it
 

453
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,350
energy don't block the camera that's it
do you see where my knee is remember my

454
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
do you see where my knee is remember my
 

455
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,230
do you see where my knee is remember my
knee okay and extend your energy out you

456
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,240
knee okay and extend your energy out you
 

457
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,990
knee okay and extend your energy out you
won't get to straighten your arm though

458
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,000
won't get to straighten your arm though
 

459
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,189
won't get to straighten your arm though
right okay so this energy is going going

460
00:12:59,189 --> 00:12:59,199
right okay so this energy is going going
 

461
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,069
right okay so this energy is going going
this way

462
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:01,079
this way
 

463
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,710
this way
boom okay so w in other words it's not

464
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
boom okay so w in other words it's not
 

465
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,790
boom okay so w in other words it's not
going this

466
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
going this
 

467
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,189
going this
way this whole you could forget the the

468
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:08,199
way this whole you could forget the the
 

469
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,189
way this whole you could forget the the
lower arm this whole thing's going this

470
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:11,199
lower arm this whole thing's going this
 

471
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,110
lower arm this whole thing's going this
way okay so he can move cuz I have my

472
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
way okay so he can move cuz I have my
 

473
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,350
way okay so he can move cuz I have my
knee there I put it in place and you're

474
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
knee there I put it in place and you're
 

475
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,310
knee there I put it in place and you're
going to see that I don't turn I just

476
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,320
going to see that I don't turn I just
 

477
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,629
going to see that I don't turn I just
move do you see this way I'm making that

478
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:25,639
move do you see this way I'm making that
 

479
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,829
move do you see this way I'm making that
thing go that way not this thing go that

480
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:30,839
thing go that way not this thing go that
 

481
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,030
thing go that way not this thing go that
way okay and that's just like the Kimura

482
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,040
way okay and that's just like the Kimura
 

483
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,470
way okay and that's just like the Kimura
so you're already freaking out aren't

484
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,480
so you're already freaking out aren't
 

485
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,750
so you're already freaking out aren't
you okay okay so you get it's going to

486
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:38,760
you okay okay so you get it's going to
 

487
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,430
you okay okay so you get it's going to
look how slow I'm moving actually pay

488
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,440
look how slow I'm moving actually pay
 

489
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,829
look how slow I'm moving actually pay
attention to how slow and how little I'm

490
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:42,839
attention to how slow and how little I'm
 

491
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,430
attention to how slow and how little I'm
moving yeah there you go you see you get

492
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,440
moving yeah there you go you see you get
 

493
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,790
moving yeah there you go you see you get
it you don't have to freak out like that

494
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
it you don't have to freak out like that
 

495
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,030
it you don't have to freak out like that
that's adding tension to the lock got it

496
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,040
that's adding tension to the lock got it
 

497
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,629
that's adding tension to the lock got it
but you can see oh it's in place okay

498
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
but you can see oh it's in place okay
 

499
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,230
but you can see oh it's in place okay
and I'm just increment increasing that

500
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
and I'm just increment increasing that
 

501
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,590
and I'm just increment increasing that
pressure you tap when you don't like it

502
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
pressure you tap when you don't like it
 

503
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,470
pressure you tap when you don't like it
