okay so this is the last video that I'm

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
okay so this is the last video that I'm
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,669
okay so this is the last video that I'm
doing in this series of the four basic

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
doing in this series of the four basic
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,990
doing in this series of the four basic
modes in Indian clubs three previous

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
modes in Indian clubs three previous

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,390
modes in Indian clubs three previous
videos will be posted in the description

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
videos will be posted in the description

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,509
videos will be posted in the description
below so today we're going to look at

10
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:10,519
below so today we're going to look at
 

11
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,190
below so today we're going to look at
split Time same

12
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
split Time same
 

13
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,430
split Time same
direction this mode differs slightly

14
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
direction this mode differs slightly
 

15
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,029
direction this mode differs slightly
from the other modes in the fact that my

16
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
from the other modes in the fact that my
 

17
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,670
from the other modes in the fact that my
arms aren't extended the whole

18
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
arms aren't extended the whole
 

19
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,990
arms aren't extended the whole
time as you can see here as my arms meet

20
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,000
time as you can see here as my arms meet
 

21
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,349
time as you can see here as my arms meet
in the middle I need to bend at my

22
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
in the middle I need to bend at my
 

23
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,349
in the middle I need to bend at my
elbows to allow them to cross if that

24
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:28,359
elbows to allow them to cross if that
 

25
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,710
elbows to allow them to cross if that
doesn't happen they end up hitting each

26
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:29,720
doesn't happen they end up hitting each
 

27
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,669
doesn't happen they end up hitting each
other

28
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:30,679
other
 

29
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,869
other
and Crossing like this it's possible to

30
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:33,879
and Crossing like this it's possible to
 

31
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,590
and Crossing like this it's possible to
do this and turn and go into a weave but

32
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600
do this and turn and go into a weave but
 

33
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,150
do this and turn and go into a weave but
for now I won't be covering that in this

34
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
for now I won't be covering that in this
 

35
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,670
for now I won't be covering that in this
video so going back to our key points

36
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
video so going back to our key points
 

37
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,389
video so going back to our key points
your arms should be at opposite ends

38
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
your arms should be at opposite ends
 

39
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,229
your arms should be at opposite ends
apart from when they're cross in the

40
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
apart from when they're cross in the
 

41
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,510
apart from when they're cross in the
middle at this point you should leave

42
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,520
middle at this point you should leave
 

43
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,229
middle at this point you should leave
just enough space for your forearms to

00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
just enough space for your forearms to
 

45
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,350
just enough space for your forearms to
pass each

pass each
 

47
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,950
pass each
other as you can see here both my arms

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
points so with the clubs we'll do the
 

69
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,350
points so with the clubs we'll do the
same thing but this time we need to

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,360
same thing but this time we need to
 

71
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,749
same thing but this time we need to
allow a bit more space for the clubs to

00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
allow a bit more space for the clubs to
 

73
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:23,870
allow a bit more space for the clubs to
pass in the

middle arms want to be extended as they
 

77
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,990
middle arms want to be extended as they
sweep out the ends of the clubs should

78
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
sweep out the ends of the clubs should
 

79
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,429
sweep out the ends of the clubs should
always be facing opposite directions

00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:32,439
always be facing opposite directions
 

81
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,230
always be facing opposite directions
even when they pass in the

even when they pass in the
 

83
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,910
even when they pass in the
middle once the movement starts to feel

rotation if you find that everything's
 

91
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,310
rotation if you find that everything's
in time then try doing it in one

motion and it should look something like
this so this is rotating to my left now

98
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
this so this is rotating to my left now
 

99
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,749

right start off the same in Shing you're
 

103
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,469
right start off the same in Shing you're
hitting all four key points and Crossing

continuously so now we'll have a look at

116
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
continuously so now we'll have a look at
 

117
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,229
continuously so now we'll have a look at
the Windmill the windmill is basically a

118
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,239
the Windmill the windmill is basically a
 

119
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,949
the Windmill the windmill is basically a
reel like covered in mode one but done

120
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
reel like covered in mode one but done
 

121
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,550
reel like covered in mode one but done
in Split time so instead of both clubs

122
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,560
in Split time so instead of both clubs
 

123
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,509
in Split time so instead of both clubs
together they actually split and they're

124
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:40,519
together they actually split and they're
 

125
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,869
together they actually split and they're
opposite ends you can achieve this by

126
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
opposite ends you can achieve this by
 

127
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,509
opposite ends you can achieve this by
speeding up your inside arm from same

128
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
speeding up your inside arm from same
 

129
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,110
speeding up your inside arm from same
time to split

130
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,120
time to split
 

131
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,910
time to split
time so to break this down you can see

132
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
time so to break this down you can see
 

133
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,390
time so to break this down you can see
here I'm doing a reel with my right hand

134
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
here I'm doing a reel with my right hand
 

135
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,910
here I'm doing a reel with my right hand
going

136
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920

 

137
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,509

outwards then with my left hand I'm

138
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:58,519
outwards then with my left hand I'm
 

139
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,030
outwards then with my left hand I'm
doing a real go going

140
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
doing a real go going
 

141
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,309
doing a real go going
inwards I'm only demonstrating One

142
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:03,319
inwards I'm only demonstrating One
 

143
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,949
inwards I'm only demonstrating One
Direction here so the same will need to

144
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
Direction here so the same will need to
 

145
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,390
Direction here so the same will need to
be repeated on the other

146
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400

side so putting them together if you
 

149
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,910
side so putting them together if you
start with your arms out it should look

150
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
start with your arms out it should look
 

151
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,589
start with your arms out it should look
something like
