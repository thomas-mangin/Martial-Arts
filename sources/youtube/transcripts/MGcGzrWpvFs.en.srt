when that doesn't mean that my right
 

11
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:59,940
when that doesn't mean that my right

to come to my right and the left hand is
 

17
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,009
to come to my right and the left hand is
going to come to my left and that's what

weapons to the right and this is the
 

29
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,890
weapons to the right and this is the
tactic that is important to know what do

you do when your weapon is too though to

32
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:12,660
you do when your weapon is too though to
 

33
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,290
you do when your weapon is too though to
the outside of you you move towards it

the outside of you you move towards it
 

35
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,510
the outside of you you move towards it
it moves towards you that is the fastest

36
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:17,520
it moves towards you that is the fastest
 

37
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:33,239
it moves towards you that is the fastest
way to create an angle deflection

that's closest to you or let's just say

76
00:05:59,309 --> 00:05:59,319
that's closest to you or let's just say
 

77
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,959
that's closest to you or let's just say
the shoulder width is closest to you

78
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:00,969
the shoulder width is closest to you
 

79
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,399
the shoulder width is closest to you
that is where you're going to determine

80
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,409
that is where you're going to determine
 

81
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,679
that is where you're going to determine
where can I hold one handed and still

82
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:07,689
where can I hold one handed and still
 

83
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,649
where can I hold one handed and still
have decent control over the joke so

84
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:10,659
have decent control over the joke so
 

85
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,739
have decent control over the joke so
where my left hand is now that is

86
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:13,749
where my left hand is now that is
 

87
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,839
where my left hand is now that is
generally the vicinity where I'm going

88
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:15,849
generally the vicinity where I'm going
 

89
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,479
generally the vicinity where I'm going
to operate the Joe one-handed so if we

90
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:18,489
to operate the Joe one-handed so if we
 

91
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:24,850
to operate the Joe one-handed so if we
go back you see

92
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:24,860

 

93
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,240

the same thing here I put it right where

94
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,250
the same thing here I put it right where
 

95
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,300
the same thing here I put it right where
I'm going to have power for it this

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,310
I'm going to have power for it this
 

97
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,090
I'm going to have power for it this
isn't going to be it this is going to be

98
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,100
isn't going to be it this is going to be
 

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,420
isn't going to be it this is going to be
in and so where is that hand well it's

100
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,430
in and so where is that hand well it's
 

101
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,380
in and so where is that hand well it's
at one-third shoulder with that not that

102
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,390
at one-third shoulder with that not that
 

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,410
at one-third shoulder with that not that
okay let's go back to this technique now

104
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:47,420
okay let's go back to this technique now
 

105
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,780
okay let's go back to this technique now
it's the same thing mold when I come

106
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:53,790
it's the same thing mold when I come
 

107
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,540
it's the same thing mold when I come
down here if I'm down here at this at

108
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,550
down here if I'm down here at this at
 

109
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,300
down here if I'm down here at this at
the end you're not going to have much

110
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,310
the end you're not going to have much
 

111
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:07,220
the end you're not going to have much
power on so find out one third when I

112
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,230
power on so find out one third when I
 

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:17,000
power on so find out one third when I
first shoulder width that's a little shy

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,010
first shoulder width that's a little shy
 

115
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,800
first shoulder width that's a little shy
I'd walk I wanted a little shorter baby

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:23,810

 

117
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,870

but the target is also going to

118
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
but the target is also going to
 

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,610
but the target is also going to
determine where i could be okay so let's

120
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:31,620
determine where i could be okay so let's
 

121
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,500
determine where i could be okay so let's
say i shorten it and look okay so i go

122
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:36,510
say i shorten it and look okay so i go
 

123
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,490
say i shorten it and look okay so i go
back to where i was and look so you're

124
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:40,500
back to where i was and look so you're
 

125
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,920
back to where i was and look so you're
in there just know that when you're 24

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:42,930
in there just know that when you're 24
 

127
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,750
in there just know that when you're 24
and you're not going to have that angle

128
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:44,760
and you're not going to have that angle
 

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,620
and you're not going to have that angle
deflection integrity that you want okay

130
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:47,630
deflection integrity that you want okay
 

131
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,150
deflection integrity that you want okay
but you can add to it and that's

132
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
but you can add to it and that's
 

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:08:05,030
but you can add to it and that's
important with the second right so let's

134
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,040
important with the second right so let's
 

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:19,980
important with the second right so let's
switch roles

136
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:19,990

 

137
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,580

so why does that happen you did have the

138
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,590
so why does that happen you did have the
 

139
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,170
so why does that happen you did have the
backup mass on the angle of deflection

140
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,180
backup mass on the angle of deflection
 

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,050
backup mass on the angle of deflection
and you have to understand that this key

142
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,060
and you have to understand that this key
 

143
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,490
and you have to understand that this key
is not a straight angle there's a cork

144
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:33,500
is not a straight angle there's a cork
 

145
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:44,260
is not a straight angle there's a cork
screwing to it okay let's be aware not

146
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,270
screwing to it okay let's be aware not
 

147
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:57,670
screwing to it okay let's be aware not
all those eyes okay just like when you

148
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
all those eyes okay just like when you
 

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,210

have the backyard dead and you go like

154
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:08,630
have the backyard dead and you go like
 

155
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,450
have the backyard dead and you go like
that the body has a two-by-four on the
