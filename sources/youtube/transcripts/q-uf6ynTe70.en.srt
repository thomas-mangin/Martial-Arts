01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,910

organization and still

1244
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920

 

1245
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:31,550

here I'm not going to go like this

1246
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:31,560

 

1247
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:51,870

keep going keep

1248
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:51,880

 

1249
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,750

going

1250
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
going
 

1251
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:02,070
going
okay smooth

1252
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080

 

1253
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:14,990

okay let's try it

1254
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,000

 

1255
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,950

again again you're going to go is how

1256
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:17,960
again again you're going to go is how
 

1257
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,470
again again you're going to go is how
you going to land okay that's what we're

1258
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:20,480
you going to land okay that's what we're
 

1259
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,590
you going to land okay that's what we're
interested

1260
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:22,600
interested
 

1261
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,550
interested
in so right there we been bring your

1262
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:25,560
in so right there we been bring your

1271
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:40,910

remember that projecting arms on the

1272
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:40,920
remember that projecting arms on the
 

1273
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,030

different
 

1275
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,830
different
angle the head comes around me the hips

1276
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:46,840
angle the head comes around me the hips
 

1277
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,430
angle the head comes around me the hips
go away from

1278
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
go away from
 

1279
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,550
go away from
me reach

1280
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:51,560
me reach
 

1281
01:14:51,560 --> 01:15:03,520
me reach
out go over the top of his come under

1282
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:03,530

 

1283

1285
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:33,790

CER so let's look at what we're doing

1286
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:33,800

 

1287
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,629

pushing and I started in that

1288
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:38,639

 

1289
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:43,470

relationship I am going to come to the

1290
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:43,480

 

1291
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,110

90 and start this thing rotating this

1292
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
90 and start this thing rotating this
 

1293
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,750
90 and start this thing rotating this
way as it rotates this way I'm in the

1294
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:50,760
way as it rotates this way I'm in the
 

1295
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,070
way as it rotates this way I'm in the
middle of

1296
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
middle of
 

1297
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,430
middle of
it I want the head to go here but I

1298
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
it I want the head to go here but I
 

1299
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,669
it I want the head to go here but I
don't want his hips to follow him I want

1300
01:15:58,669 --> 01:15:58,679
don't want his hips to follow him I want
 

1301
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:02,270
don't want his hips to follow him I want
his hips to go that

1302
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:02,280

 

1303
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,350

way his head goes this way his hips go

1304
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,360
way his head goes this way his hips go
 

1305
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,669
way his head goes this way his hips go
that way his feet are going to go this

1306
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:08,679
that way his feet are going to go this
 

1307
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:12,070
that way his feet are going to go this
way from the Cal

1308

so if you

1312
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:16,440
so if you
 

1313
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,830
so if you
go his hips are going that way his

1314
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:19,840
go his hips are going that way his
 

1315
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,430
go his hips are going that way his
head's coming this way and his feet are

1316
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:22,440
head's coming this way and his feet are
 

1317
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,629
head's coming this way and his feet are
going that

1318
01:16:23,629 --> 01:16:23,639
going that
 

1319
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:26,430
going that
way it

1320
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:26,440
way it

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,510
entirely different direction from the
center okay so here what I've done is

01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
center okay so here what I've done is
 

1339
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,750
center okay so here what I've done is
the center and the head are no longer in

1340
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:00,760
the center and the head are no longer in
 

1341
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,790
the center and the head are no longer in
vertical alignment to each

1342
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:03,800
vertical alignment to each
 

1343
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,629
vertical alignment to each
other and his feet are no longer

1344
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:07,639
other and his feet are no longer
 

1345
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:11,310
other and his feet are no longer
underneath him so he can stand

1346
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:11,320
underneath him so he can stand
 

1347
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,110
underneath him so he can stand
understand

1348
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
understand
 

1349
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,270
understand
okay not only

1350
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
okay not only
 

1351
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,990
okay not only
that but his head's over here on this

1352
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,000
that but his head's over here on this
 

1353
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,430
that but his head's over here on this
trajectory is

1354
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:22,440
trajectory is
 

1355
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,709
trajectory is
Center is going over here

1356
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:25,719
Center is going over here
 

1357
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:30,229
Center is going over here
on that trajectory and his feet are on

1358
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
on that trajectory and his feet are on
 

1359
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,750
on that trajectory and his feet are on
this trajectory over here now he has the

1360
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:33,760
this trajectory over here now he has the
 

1361
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,790
this trajectory over here now he has the
fall okay as long as what there's one

1362
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
fall okay as long as what there's one
 

1363
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,870
fall okay as long as what there's one
more thing I told you

1364
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
more thing I told you
 

1365
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,870
more thing I told you
earlier for him to go Topsy tur what his

1366
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
earlier for him to go Topsy tur what his
 

1367
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,790
earlier for him to go Topsy tur what his
his head has to go below the hip so this

1368
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
his head has to go below the hip so this
 

1369
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,189
his head has to go below the hip so this
is two dimensional you have to imagine

1370
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
is two dimensional you have to imagine
 

1371
01:17:47,199 --> 01:18:07,149
is two dimensional you have to imagine
it threedimensional about that okay

1372
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:07,159

 

1373
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:26,590

okay try

1374
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:26,600

 

1375
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,550

give it one more try Ronin just the same

1376
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:29,560
give it one more try Ronin just the same
 

1377
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,669
give it one more try Ronin just the same
same Pace was

1378

1379
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:43,629

fine okay switch

01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:43,639

 

1381
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:47,310

rolls good good you can you I want you

1382
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:47,320
rolls good good you can you I want you
 

1383
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,430
rolls good good you can you I want you
to work on everything you're working on

1384
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:50,440
to work on everything you're working on
 

1385
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,590
to work on everything you're working on
but at higher intensity levels he's

1386
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:52,600
but at higher intensity levels he's
 

1387
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,750
but at higher intensity levels he's
going to be fine okay don't go so high

1388
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
going to be fine okay don't go so high
 

1389
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:02,229
going to be fine okay don't go so high
you can't work on it anymore

1390
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239

 

1391
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,510

okay

1392
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:06,520

 

1393
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:11,669

good keep separating head feet and

1394
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:11,679

yes faster

1398
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,260

01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,830
got to lower lower the hand head
high so right under first move his head

1410
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
high so right under first move his head
 

1411
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,110
high so right under first move his head
goes down on the first move from the
