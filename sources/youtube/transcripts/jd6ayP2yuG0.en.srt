to the young ground path okay so you got

218
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,050
to the young ground path okay so you got
 

219
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,430

to push your knee to your toes then that
 

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
to push your knee to your toes then that
becomes a positive angle and guess what

this a push your knees to your toes and
 

227
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,970
this a push your knees to your toes and
so that becomes a positive angle a lot
