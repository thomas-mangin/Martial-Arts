then we're in the same boat over here

66
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
then we're in the same boat over here
 

67
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,190
then we're in the same boat over here
but at that angle over there you see how

68
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200
but at that angle over there you see how
 

69
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,709
but at that angle over there you see how
he y to get off of it I follow it in

00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:53,719

 

71
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,550

and so again on contact there's the

72
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
and so again on contact there's the
 

73
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,709
and so again on contact there's the
tilts don't ask for more cuz he's going

around and opens it
 

87
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,589
around and opens it
up okay let's try it

88
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599

 

89
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,229

again all right so tactically for your

00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
again all right so tactically for your
 

91
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,550
again all right so tactically for your
Kon waza this is just the essence of it

92
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
Kon waza this is just the essence of it
 

93
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,710
Kon waza this is just the essence of it
that the guy's going to have some young

that the guy's going to have some young
 

95
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,030
that the guy's going to have some young
energy and you're going to take it into

96
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,040
energy and you're going to take it into
 

97
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,149
energy and you're going to take it into
a spinal tilt he's going to react to it

98
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:40,159
a spinal tilt he's going to react to it
 

99
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,270
a spinal tilt he's going to react to it
and then you keep uh reconciling yin and

100
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
and then you keep uh reconciling yin and
 

101
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,910
and then you keep uh reconciling yin and
yang as it's going but those two

102
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
yang as it's going but those two
 

103
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,910
yang as it's going but those two
components he's going to give yangong so

104
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:48,920
components he's going to give yangong so
 

105
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,390
components he's going to give yangong so
I'm going to do some sort of Yin

106
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm going to do some sort of Yin
 

107
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,390
I'm going to do some sort of Yin
manifestation and in that Yin

108
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
manifestation and in that Yin
 

109
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,070
manifestation and in that Yin
manifestation I'm going to tilt him he's

110
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,080
manifestation I'm going to tilt him he's
 

111
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,430
manifestation I'm going to tilt him he's
in this case because it's not prescribed

112
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
in this case because it's not prescribed
 

113
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,229
in this case because it's not prescribed
he do things okay uh but those things

114
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
he do things okay uh but those things
 

115
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,750
he do things okay uh but those things
then will keep taking him further and

116
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
then will keep taking him further and
 

117
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,470
then will keep taking him further and
further off balance okay so we have to

118
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,480
further off balance okay so we have to
 

119
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,350
further off balance okay so we have to
ask why all right so he's going to make

120
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:12,360
ask why all right so he's going to make
 

121
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,750
ask why all right so he's going to make
contact there's his young energy so I

122
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
contact there's his young energy so I
 

123
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,830
contact there's his young energy so I
come around and you have this Yin yield

124
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
come around and you have this Yin yield
 

125
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,550
come around and you have this Yin yield
so let's look at this one go back he

126
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
so let's look at this one go back he
 

127
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,309
so let's look at this one go back he
comes there's your Yin

00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
comes there's your Yin
 

129
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,949
comes there's your Yin
yield and he had that one too and this

130
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
yield and he had that one too and this
 

131
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,190
yield and he had that one too and this
one just went out the the two went this

132
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,200
one just went out the the two went this
 

133
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,990
one just went out the the two went this
way you see there's my tilt okay but I

134
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
way you see there's my tilt okay but I
 

135
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,949
way you see there's my tilt okay but I
didn't just get out of the way it's not

136
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
didn't just get out of the way it's not
 

137
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,589
didn't just get out of the way it's not
going to tilt him and that's where the

138
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
going to tilt him and that's where the
 

139
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,789
going to tilt him and that's where the
internal comes in so do you feel that

140
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:41,799
internal comes in so do you feel that
 

141
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,869
internal comes in so do you feel that
pull right he go it's a pull and then

pull right he go it's a pull and then
 

143
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,670
pull right he go it's a pull and then
when he goes off of when he's trying to

149
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,830
attention it get it's getting more do
you feel it it's getting more friction

150
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
you feel it it's getting more friction
 

151
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,990

even as you're moving okay and then that

152
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,000
even as you're moving okay and then that

makes you pull more it increases more
okay so I can't just try to tilt him I

158
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:08,519
okay so I can't just try to tilt him I
 

159
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,190
okay so I can't just try to tilt him I
have to yield and stick I don't have

160
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
have to yield and stick I don't have
 

161
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,030
have to yield and stick I don't have
much here can you see that but you can't

162
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,040
much here can you see that but you can't
 

163
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,949
much here can you see that but you can't
come forward on that arm do you see that

164
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
come forward on that arm do you see that
 

165
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,789
come forward on that arm do you see that
and as you come forward you'll feel it

166
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
and as you come forward you'll feel it
 

167
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,469
and as you come forward you'll feel it
increasing the adhesion and now I can do

168
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:21,479
increasing the adhesion and now I can do
 

169
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,670
increasing the adhesion and now I can do
stuff with it you see you feel that okay

170
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
stuff with it you see you feel that okay
 

171
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,950
stuff with it you see you feel that okay
but so I don't do anything it's just

172

checking you here but this hand is
 

175
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,469
checking you here but this hand is
adhering and so you're going to do

176
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
adhering and so you're going to do
 

177
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,230
adhering and so you're going to do
whatever right and now this hand

178
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
whatever right and now this hand
 

179
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,670
whatever right and now this hand
increase did you feel it increase okay

180
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
increase did you feel it increase okay
 

181
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,310
increase did you feel it increase okay
and so then I can do

that if I have his
 

297
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,430
