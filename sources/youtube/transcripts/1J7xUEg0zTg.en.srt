1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,029

so that opening was actually present in

2
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
so that opening was actually present in
 

3
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,029
so that opening was actually present in
the last two reps but Sean you went into

4
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
the last two reps but Sean you went into
 

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:40,670
the last two reps but Sean you went into
chemi

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680

 

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,150

mode that one was down okay so

8
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160

 

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,510

here my goal is just to push okay so I

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
here my goal is just to push okay so I
 

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,229
here my goal is just to push okay so I
keep my palms and I

12
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239

 

13
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,670

push you feel that arm getting

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,680
push you feel that arm getting
 

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,869
push you feel that arm getting
compressed you see

16
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
compressed you see
 

17
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,990
compressed you see
okay so go ahead and we'll do that do

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000
okay so go ahead and we'll do that do
 

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,429
okay so go ahead and we'll do that do
that pattern again and see when he does

20
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
that pattern again and see when he does
 

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,670
that pattern again and see when he does
that so I would follow follow that hole

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,680
that so I would follow follow that hole
 

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,590
that so I would follow follow that hole
you

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
you
 

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,710
you
see so instead you go do that go ahead

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
see so instead you go do that go ahead
 

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,510
see so instead you go do that go ahead
do it again and the you stop now I'm not

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
do it again and the you stop now I'm not
 

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,030
do it again and the you stop now I'm not
pushing you

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
pushing you
 

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,469
pushing you
see but that's

32
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:21,479
see but that's
 

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,870
see but that's
Yin and now this comes here you see

34
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:25,880
Yin and now this comes here you see
 

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,749
Yin and now this comes here you see
so keep going

36
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:30,759

 

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,870

it's coming underneath you

38
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
it's coming underneath you
 

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,149
it's coming underneath you
see so he can't learn if I don't do my

40
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159

 

41
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,990

job you're trying to push what's pushing

42
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
job you're trying to push what's pushing
 

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,030
job you're trying to push what's pushing
at you right

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040

 

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,190

okay and he know he can feel that you

46
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
okay and he know he can feel that you
 

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,310
okay and he know he can feel that you
when he stops it's cuz he felt that it's

48
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
when he stops it's cuz he felt that it's
 

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,630
when he stops it's cuz he felt that it's
it was too y so he you here okay and so

50
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
it was too y so he you here okay and so
 

51
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,389
it was too y so he you here okay and so
you felt that that's what was going to

52
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:03,399
you felt that that's what was going to
 

53
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,230
you felt that that's what was going to
happen Okay and then he stopped

54
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
happen Okay and then he stopped
 

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,109
happen Okay and then he stopped
so you should be able to

56
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
so you should be able to
 

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,150
so you should be able to
see he changing it he can feel it but

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
see he changing it he can feel it but
 

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,869
see he changing it he can feel it but
you should be able to see it like I saw

60
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:13,879
you should be able to see it like I saw
 

61
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,229
you should be able to see it like I saw
it

62
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:17,239

 

63
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,589

okay so he's trying to push what's

64
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
okay so he's trying to push what's
 

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,910
okay so he's trying to push what's
pushing on him it just do you I'm just

66
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
pushing on him it just do you I'm just
 

67
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,229
pushing on him it just do you I'm just
like I'm allowed to talk and then

68
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:25,239
like I'm allowed to talk and then
 

69
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,190
like I'm allowed to talk and then
eventually he pushes me over right on

70
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
eventually he pushes me over right on
 

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,869
eventually he pushes me over right on
that rep

72
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879

 

73
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,190

there's that y

74
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,200

 

75
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,390

again so I'm not pushing my hardest

76
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,400
again so I'm not pushing my hardest
 

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,910
again so I'm not pushing my hardest
right so the Y value is relatively low

78
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:48,920
right so the Y value is relatively low
 

79
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,430
right so the Y value is relatively low
which is why he could push that over

80
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
which is why he could push that over
 

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,470
which is why he could push that over
that last time but here he goes to Yin

82
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
that last time but here he goes to Yin
 

83
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,630
that last time but here he goes to Yin
even this low y value is going to expose

84
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
even this low y value is going to expose
 

85
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:10,430
even this low y value is going to expose
the in space and he feels it right

86
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,440

 

87
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,229

there okay all right so don't push

88
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
there okay all right so don't push
 

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,149
there okay all right so don't push
what's pushing at you okay even even if

90
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,159
what's pushing at you okay even even if
 

91
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,430
what's pushing at you okay even even if
you could overpower it you shouldn't

92
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
you could overpower it you shouldn't
 

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,710
you could overpower it you shouldn't
okay careful you go here in the external

94
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
okay careful you go here in the external
 

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,270
okay careful you go here in the external
yield you're going to get smashed okay

96
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
yield you're going to get smashed okay
 

97
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,309
yield you're going to get smashed okay
so even though you're moving this way

98
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
so even though you're moving this way
 

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,390
so even though you're moving this way
let go here you can't you can't compress

100
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
let go here you can't you can't compress
 

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,390
let go here you can't you can't compress
it you see and so I can turn

102
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
it you see and so I can turn
 

103
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,589
it you see and so I can turn
it you see and then you have the

104
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
it you see and then you have the
 

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,949
it you see and then you have the
projection on this arm

106
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:49,959

 

107
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,670

okay so right now you're looking to

108
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
okay so right now you're looking to
 

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,949
okay so right now you're looking to
push or even set up a push where you're

110
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:57,959
push or even set up a push where you're
 

111
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,750
push or even set up a push where you're
now going to push here

112
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:00,760
now going to push here
 

113
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,589
now going to push here
okay take the pressure that's happening

114
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
okay take the pressure that's happening
 

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,630
okay take the pressure that's happening
you see that that pressure there find

116
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
you see that that pressure there find
 

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,390
you see that that pressure there find
out how to turn

118
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
out how to turn
 

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,190
out how to turn
it

120
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
it
 

121
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,910
it
okay and

122
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
okay and
 

123
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,110
okay and
then easy to manipulate okay so even

124
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,120
then easy to manipulate okay so even
 

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,189
then easy to manipulate okay so even
with a good C or a good

126
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
with a good C or a good
 

127
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,070
with a good C or a good
muscle you don't want to use those

128
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,080
muscle you don't want to use those
 

129
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,870
muscle you don't want to use those
things in isolation from sound

130
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
things in isolation from sound
 

131
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,270
things in isolation from sound
in geometry in this drill okay so we'll

132
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
in geometry in this drill okay so we'll
 

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,189
in geometry in this drill okay so we'll
I'll look at that pattern again you can

134
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
I'll look at that pattern again you can
 

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,230
I'll look at that pattern again you can
see how he's getting on top of it you

136
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
see how he's getting on top of it you
 

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,909
see how he's getting on top of it you
see so I don't want to go

138
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:40,919
see so I don't want to go
 

139
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,629
see so I don't want to go
up okay so I know as you're pushing

140
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
up okay so I know as you're pushing
 

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,790
up okay so I know as you're pushing
there has to be some downward yield you

142
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
there has to be some downward yield you
 

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,070
there has to be some downward yield you
see that's why that's happening every

144
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
see that's why that's happening every
 

145
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,670
see that's why that's happening every
time you

146
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:50,680
time you
 

147
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,070
time you
see so let's look he's sitting up higher

148
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
see so let's look he's sitting up higher
 

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,749
see so let's look he's sitting up higher
than me and so when he goes to push

150
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
than me and so when he goes to push
 

151
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,390
than me and so when he goes to push
there's a downward this do you see it

152
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
there's a downward this do you see it
 

153
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,230
there's a downward this do you see it
Sean okay

154
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
Sean okay
 

155
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,909
Sean okay
and so I don't try to shove up I don't

156
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:02,919
and so I don't try to shove up I don't
 

157
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,710
and so I don't try to shove up I don't
try to shove this way I have to find the

158
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:05,720
try to shove this way I have to find the
 

159
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,350
try to shove this way I have to find the
shape that goes with your downward this

160
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,360
shape that goes with your downward this
 

161
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,550
shape that goes with your downward this
that takes you into that P okay all

162
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
that takes you into that P okay all
 

163
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,469
that takes you into that P okay all
right so here I am and I am pushing

164
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
right so here I am and I am pushing
 

165
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,270
right so here I am and I am pushing
straight ahead you see that on you maybe

166
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
straight ahead you see that on you maybe
 

167
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,189
straight ahead you see that on you maybe
even the slide up right okay so let's

168

P okay got it okay so you got to find
 

185
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,110
P okay got it okay so you got to find
the shape not just push against it okay

186
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
the shape not just push against it okay
 

187
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,950
the shape not just push against it okay
all right let's try that let's bring

188
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
all right let's try that let's bring
 

189
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,189
all right let's try that let's bring
some awareness that I do have

190
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199

 

191
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,390

to adapt to what you're doing

192
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
to adapt to what you're doing

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720

 

195
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,589

okay so

196
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:47,599
okay so
 

197
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,830
okay so
um so with Thea's correction is just to

198
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
um so with Thea's correction is just to
 

199
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,110
um so with Thea's correction is just to
note there is a pattern you must take

200
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
note there is a pattern you must take
 

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,469
note there is a pattern you must take
okay you can't just push

202
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
okay you can't just push
 

203
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,670
okay you can't just push
push now here we want to know what that

204
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
push now here we want to know what that
 

205
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,830
push now here we want to know what that
pattern is okay so kind of what you're

206
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
pattern is okay so kind of what you're
 

207
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,589
pattern is okay so kind of what you're
doing is the kind of turning him let me

208
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
doing is the kind of turning him let me
 

209
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,270
doing is the kind of turning him let me
let me you're kind of like turning him

210
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,280
let me you're kind of like turning him
 

211
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,270
let me you're kind of like turning him
you

212
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
you
 

213
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,430
you
see sometimes you turn him just kind of

214
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,440
see sometimes you turn him just kind of
 

215
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,189
see sometimes you turn him just kind of
turn turning

216
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
turn turning
 

217
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,749
turn turning
him and then sometimes you just

218
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:24,759

 

219
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,510

pushed okay and what we

220
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
pushed okay and what we
 

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,950
pushed okay and what we
want is not not a

222
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:31,960
want is not not a
 

223
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,869
want is not not a
turn but a tilt so the yin hand is going

224
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:36,879
turn but a tilt so the yin hand is going
 

225
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,749
turn but a tilt so the yin hand is going
to generate some sort of tilt okay and

226
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:40,759
to generate some sort of tilt okay and
 

227
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,430
to generate some sort of tilt okay and
there's a tilt you see that it's in this

228
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
there's a tilt you see that it's in this
 

229
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,990
there's a tilt you see that it's in this
plane here but we have this plane here

230
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,000
plane here but we have this plane here
 

231
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,070
plane here but we have this plane here
so I do the same tilt and I bring it

232
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
so I do the same tilt and I bring it
 

233
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,070
so I do the same tilt and I bring it
this way you see now you're tilting

234
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,080
this way you see now you're tilting
 

235
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,550
this way you see now you're tilting
forward and you're tilting laterally

236
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
forward and you're tilting laterally
 

237
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,149
forward and you're tilting laterally
okay so the yin hand is is always going

238
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:01,159
okay so the yin hand is is always going
 

239
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,629
okay so the yin hand is is always going
to tilt

240
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
to tilt
 

241
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,230
to tilt
you in those two Dimensions

242
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,240
you in those two Dimensions
 

243
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,029
you in those two Dimensions
okay and then the Y hand is always going

244
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
okay and then the Y hand is always going
 

245
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,909
okay and then the Y hand is always going
to now cut across the

246
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:16,919
to now cut across the
 

247
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,189
to now cut across the
Tilt and so this is why I can't turn

248
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199
Tilt and so this is why I can't turn
 

249
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,430
Tilt and so this is why I can't turn
you that never

250
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:24,440
you that never
 

251
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,830
you that never
happens even if I pull you and I get

252
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
happens even if I pull you and I get
 

253
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,869
happens even if I pull you and I get
that tilt there you see this hand

254
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:31,879
that tilt there you see this hand
 

255
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,230
that tilt there you see this hand
doesn't go and turn you more

256
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240

 

257
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,350

okay and obviously I get a tilt here now

258
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,360
okay and obviously I get a tilt here now
 

259
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,150
okay and obviously I get a tilt here now
both hands are pushing do you see this

260
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,160
both hands are pushing do you see this
 

261
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,310
both hands are pushing do you see this
hand stopped so you must always get the

262
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
hand stopped so you must always get the
 

263
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,949
hand stopped so you must always get the
Tilt it's coming forward then through

264
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:53,959
Tilt it's coming forward then through
 

265
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,949
Tilt it's coming forward then through
the center

266
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959

 

267
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,110

tilt see don't start doing

268
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
tilt see don't start doing
 

269
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,190
tilt see don't start doing
that this one goes this

270
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200

 

271
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,590

way take the one I was doing with the

272
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:12,600
way take the one I was doing with the
 

273
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,069
way take the one I was doing with the
youu so you give me that that downward

274
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:15,079
youu so you give me that that downward
 

275
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,670
youu so you give me that that downward
this that he was giving me right and

276
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
this that he was giving me right and
 

277
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,389
this that he was giving me right and
you'll see who there's the Tilt now this

278
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:21,399
you'll see who there's the Tilt now this
 

279
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,470
you'll see who there's the Tilt now this
one doesn't go this way it goes that

280
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
one doesn't go this way it goes that
 

281
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,910
one doesn't go this way it goes that
way okay

282
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
way okay
 

283
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,829
way okay

Center there okay we're kind of putting
 

319
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,230
Center there okay we're kind of putting
aside the energetics for now okay and

320
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
aside the energetics for now okay and
 

321
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,470
aside the energetics for now okay and
just working with physical part of

322
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,480
just working with physical part of
 

323
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,790
just working with physical part of
things all right we'll get there all

324

hand you see that okay you move the qua

334
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,200
hand you see that okay you move the qua
 

335
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,710
hand you see that okay you move the qua
from the top so you know that the qua

336
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:29,720
from the top so you know that the qua
 

337
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,470
from the top so you know that the qua
from the seams but there's a top to the

338
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
from the seams but there's a top to the
 

339
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,829
from the seams but there's a top to the
quaw okay and that's what you move so

340
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
quaw okay and that's what you move so
 

341
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,230
quaw okay and that's what you move so
you get the Tilt and then you move that

342
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
you get the Tilt and then you move that
 

343
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,590
you get the Tilt and then you move that
top

344
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,600
top
 

345
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,750
top
part you

346
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:42,760
part you

see as opposed to here trying to shove
 

349
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,110
see as opposed to here trying to shove
okay even if you get a good tilt you

350
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,120
okay even if you get a good tilt you
 

351
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,470
okay even if you get a good tilt you
shouldn't make your hand go like that

352
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,480
shouldn't make your hand go like that

up to this point okay so you have some
 

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,990
up to this point okay so you have some
tilts right and then you use your

400
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
tilts right and then you use your
 

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,949
tilts right and then you use your
quad that's good and I use you're

402
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
quad that's good and I use you're
 

403
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,949
quad that's good and I use you're
getting that now okay you some tilt and

404
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
getting that now okay you some tilt and
 

405
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,110
getting that now okay you some tilt and
you use the CLA again

406
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,120
you use the CLA again
 

407
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,230
you use the CLA again
okay all right now let's pay attention

408
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,240
okay all right now let's pay attention
 

409
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,310
okay all right now let's pay attention
to something okay so as you're

410
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:11,320
to something okay so as you're
 

411
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,230
to something okay so as you're
pushing and I'm starting to turn this

412
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
pushing and I'm starting to turn this
 

413
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,910
pushing and I'm starting to turn this
thing you see

414
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:16,920
thing you see
 

415
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,389
thing you see
okay at a certain point mark the value

416
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:21,399
okay at a certain point mark the value
 

417
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,990
okay at a certain point mark the value
at the at the Y hand whatever you

418
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
at the at the Y hand whatever you
 

419
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,670
at the at the Y hand whatever you
whatever that is okay and watch How It's

420
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:28,680
whatever that is okay and watch How It's
 

421
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,069
whatever that is okay and watch How It's
going to increase you see that it's

422
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:31,079
going to increase you see that it's
 

423
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,189
going to increase you see that it's
increasing that's me moving the claw

424
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
increasing that's me moving the claw
 

425
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,189
increasing that's me moving the claw
into it

426
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
into it
 

427
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,670
into it
okay I do it again I'll do that same

428
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
okay I do it again I'll do that same
 

429
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,470
okay I do it again I'll do that same
side again you're walk you're feeling

430
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,480
side again you're walk you're feeling
 

431
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,550
side again you're walk you're feeling
for this hand

432
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:41,560
for this hand
 

433
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,189
for this hand
so there it is at that value and I move

434
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
so there it is at that value and I move
 

435
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,470
so there it is at that value and I move
the quaw into it you see it goes up you

436
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
the quaw into it you see it goes up you
 

437
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,110
the quaw into it you see it goes up you
see that

438
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,120
see that
 

439
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,230
see that
okay so

440
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,240
okay so
 

441
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,389
okay so
displacement which is your Center

442
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
displacement which is your Center
 

443
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,470
displacement which is your Center
falling outside your line of gravity at

444
00:14:59,470 --> 00:14:59,480
falling outside your line of gravity at
 

445
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,189
falling outside your line of gravity at
some point has to be at a positive y to

446
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
some point has to be at a positive y to
 

447
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,790
some point has to be at a positive y to
the given value okay it has to be y plus

448
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:07,800
the given value okay it has to be y plus
 

449
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,870
the given value okay it has to be y plus
X okay so if you pay attention here is

450
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
X okay so if you pay attention here is
 

451
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,990
X okay so if you pay attention here is
the value you

452
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,000
the value you
 

453
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,990
the value you
see it's going to go soft you see that

454
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
see it's going to go soft you see that
 

455
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,990
see it's going to go soft you see that
so feel the value push okay feel that it

456
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,000
so feel the value push okay feel that it
 

457
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,949
so feel the value push okay feel that it
goes soft you see and then it it's in

458
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
goes soft you see and then it it's in
 

459
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,590
goes soft you see and then it it's in
ining again you see that

460
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
ining again you see that
 

461
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,350
ining again you see that
okay so

462
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,360
okay so
 

463
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,790
okay so
boom soft

464
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:39,800

 

465
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,870

increase what it is I'm going to

466
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
increase what it is I'm going to
 

467
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,269
increase what it is I'm going to
decrease it with the angle deviation

468
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
decrease it with the angle deviation
 

469
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,910
decrease it with the angle deviation
that's the void

470
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:46,920
that's the void
 

471
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,990
that's the void
aspect and then it'll increase you see

472
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
aspect and then it'll increase you see
 

473
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,949
aspect and then it'll increase you see
it's increasing do you see that okay so

474
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:53,959
it's increasing do you see that okay so
 

475
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,350
it's increasing do you see that okay so
I call this catching so there that is

476
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,360
I call this catching so there that is
 

477
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,749
I call this catching so there that is
I'm going to do void and I catch that

478
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
I'm going to do void and I catch that
 

479
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,269
I'm going to do void and I catch that
you see and now that is my projection so

480
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
you see and now that is my projection so
 

481
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,509
you see and now that is my projection so
before I had to

482
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
before I had to
 

483
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,749
before I had to
physically displace

484
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
physically displace
 

485
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,749
physically displace
you you see on this one I void

486
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
you you see on this one I void
 

487
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,389
you you see on this one I void
catch do you see that okay and it's it's

488
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
catch do you see that okay and it's it's
 

489
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,949
catch do you see that okay and it's it's
not magic it's it's y plus

490
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
not magic it's it's y plus
 

491
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,470
not magic it's it's y plus
X okay so not here and not keeping it at

492
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,480
X okay so not here and not keeping it at
 

493
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,829
X okay so not here and not keeping it at
Y and then adding

494
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839

 

495
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,670

X but
 

497
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:46,990
X but
y Yus X Y plus X you see that okay so

498
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,000
y Yus X Y plus X you see that okay so
 

499
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,230
y Yus X Y plus X you see that okay so
let's switch

500
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,240

 

501
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,350

rules okay so he's pushing

502
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
rules okay so he's pushing
 

503
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,470
rules okay so he's pushing
I'm not going to stay young and then

504
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm not going to stay young and then
 

505
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,470
I'm not going to stay young and then
add the plus X you

506
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
add the plus X you
 

507
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,789
add the plus X you
pushes okay there's so you can feel it

508
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
pushes okay there's so you can feel it
 

509
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,110
pushes okay there's so you can feel it
you feel like whatever that resistance

510
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
you feel like whatever that resistance
 

511
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,750
you feel like whatever that resistance
is goes off you see but then I catch it

512
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
is goes off you see but then I catch it
 

513
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,909
is goes off you see but then I catch it
boom it goes back on plus what it was

514
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
boom it goes back on plus what it was
 

515
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,710
boom it goes back on plus what it was
before okay all

516
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
before okay all
 

517
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,590
before okay all
right so let's work on that

518
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,600
right so let's work on that
 

519
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,710
right so let's work on that
catching because he's not going to be

520
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
catching because he's not going to be
 

521
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,190
catching because he's not going to be
displaced unless I go y plus X it's a

522
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,200
displaced unless I go y plus X it's a
 

523
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,750
displaced unless I go y plus X it's a
different way of achieving it okay all

524
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:38,760
different way of achieving it okay all
 

525
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,750
different way of achieving it okay all
right you keep working on what you're

526
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:40,760
right you keep working on what you're
 

527
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,350
right you keep working on what you're
working on though

528
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
working on though
 

529
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,190
working on though
okay all right so and last time I

530
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,200
okay all right so and last time I
 

531
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,710
okay all right so and last time I
voided

532
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,720
voided
 

533
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,830
voided
externally then caught it you see okay

534
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
externally then caught it you see okay
 

535
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,830
externally then caught it you see okay
so on this one so feel feel the whatever

536
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
so on this one so feel feel the whatever
 

537
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,029
so on this one so feel feel the whatever
that pressure is there there okay now

538
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
that pressure is there there okay now
 

539
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,830
that pressure is there there okay now
let's go back when I externally

540
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
let's go back when I externally
 

541
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,870
let's go back when I externally
voided where did you go into into the

542
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
voided where did you go into into the
 

543
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,430
voided where did you go into into the
opening yeah into the into the opening

you I want you to pay attention to the
value that's there and where your hand

550
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
value that's there and where your hand
 

551
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,750
value that's there and where your hand
is on on me

552
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:24,760

 

553
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,190

okay hands coming forward do you see

554
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
okay hands coming forward do you see
 

555
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,190
okay hands coming forward do you see
that everything so slight ention okay go

556
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,200
that everything so slight ention okay go
 

557
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,230
that everything so slight ention okay go
back and

558
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,240
back and
 

559
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,070
back and
grab

560
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080

 

561
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,950

okay you see you feel that okay so when

562
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
okay you see you feel that okay so when
 

563
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,549
okay you see you feel that okay so when
I release in some

564
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
I release in some
 

565
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,950
I release in some
way you came in do you see that so when

566
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
way you came in do you see that so when
 

567
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,510
way you came in do you see that so when
I

568
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
I
 

569
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,950
I
release regardless of how don't worry

570
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
release regardless of how don't worry
 

571
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,669
release regardless of how don't worry
about how right now but in some way you

572
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:56,679
about how right now but in some way you
 

573
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,430
about how right now but in some way you
came forward you see that

574
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
came forward you see that
 

575
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,909
came forward you see that
and in this way it's it's obvious to

576
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
and in this way it's it's obvious to
 

577
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,070
and in this way it's it's obvious to
understanding CU I got out of the way

578
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
understanding CU I got out of the way
 

579
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,990
understanding CU I got out of the way
okay but you felt that in some way your

580
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,000
okay but you felt that in some way your
 

581
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,590
okay but you felt that in some way your
hand started going like that do you see

582
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
hand started going like that do you see
 

583
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,029
hand started going like that do you see
okay so as you go and I release that's

584
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,039
okay so as you go and I release that's
 

585
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,990
okay so as you go and I release that's
the same exact thing you see so

586
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
the same exact thing you see so
 

587
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,990
the same exact thing you see so
I'm I'm voiding just

588
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm I'm voiding just
 

589
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,110
I'm I'm voiding just
internally and then catching catching

590
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
internally and then catching catching
 

591
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,149
internally and then catching catching
your y you see and then adding to the Y

592
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:29,159
your y you see and then adding to the Y
 

593
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,710
your y you see and then adding to the Y
okay does that make sense you feel that

594
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:31,720
okay does that make sense you feel that
 

595
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,549
okay does that make sense you feel that
okay so that's ultimately where we're

596
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
okay so that's ultimately where we're
 

597
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,310
okay so that's ultimately where we're
going but I really want you to feel as

598
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,320
going but I really want you to feel as
 

599
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,750
going but I really want you to feel as
you to do that right it's not that I had

600
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
you to do that right it's not that I had
 

601
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,350
you to do that right it's not that I had
to get out of your way do you see I

602
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
to get out of your way do you see I
 

603
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,630
to get out of your way do you see I
didn't get out of the way so even as you

604
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
didn't get out of the way so even as you
 

605
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,430
didn't get out of the way so even as you
do the external yields don't just go

606
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
do the external yields don't just go
 

607
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,070
do the external yields don't just go
like that you see so in other words we

608
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
like that you see so in other words we
 

609
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,789
like that you see so in other words we
know in the example that I'm giving

610
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
know in the example that I'm giving
 

611
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,990
know in the example that I'm giving
here's where I catch you you see but

612
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
here's where I catch you you see but
 

613
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,430
here's where I catch you you see but
it's not me just getting out of your way

614
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,440
it's not me just getting out of your way
 

615
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,149
it's not me just getting out of your way
and you came forward which is why as as

616
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
and you came forward which is why as as
 

617
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,909
and you came forward which is why as as
I'm moving into it you can't come

618
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:16,919
I'm moving into it you can't come
 

619
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,270
I'm moving into it you can't come
forward you see you can't come forward

620
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
forward you see you can't come forward
 

621
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,590
forward you see you can't come forward
you can try to bring your head forward

622
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
you can try to bring your head forward
 

623
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,350
you can try to bring your head forward
you see you can't come forward you can't

624
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,360
you see you can't come forward you can't
 

625
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,830
you see you can't come forward you can't
come forward you see can't come forward

626
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
come forward you see can't come forward
 

627
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,789
come forward you see can't come forward
and I'm you start to feel that I will

628
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
and I'm you start to feel that I will
 

629
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,430
and I'm you start to feel that I will
increase the pressure on this hand as

630
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
increase the pressure on this hand as
 

631
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,789
increase the pressure on this hand as
I'm bringing your weight onto it there

632
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:35,799
I'm bringing your weight onto it there
 

633
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,510
I'm bringing your weight onto it there
it is right there you see you add a

634
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:38,520
it is right there you see you add a
 

635
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,110
it is right there you see you add a
little claw and I'll here you go okay

636
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
little claw and I'll here you go okay
 

637
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,190
little claw and I'll here you go okay
so not just get out of those see this

638
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,200
so not just get out of those see this
 

639
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,190
so not just get out of those see this
all week your head can come forward you

640
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,200
all week your head can come forward you
 

641
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,990
all week your head can come forward you
see no no no you are

642
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
see no no no you are
 

643
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,190
see no no no you are
yielding externally but inside that is

644
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,200
yielding externally but inside that is
 

645
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,870
yielding externally but inside that is
that internal yield that you feel okay

646
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
that internal yield that you feel okay
 

647
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,750
that internal yield that you feel okay
and so you have to watch the the the

648
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:02,760
and so you have to watch the the the
 

649
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,270
and so you have to watch the the the
tension but then understand release is

650
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,280
tension but then understand release is
 

651
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,710
tension but then understand release is
not just get out of the way and the guy

652
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
not just get out of the way and the guy
 

653
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,310
not just get out of the way and the guy
falls through the trapo kind of thing

654
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,320
falls through the trapo kind of thing
 

655
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,269
falls through the trapo kind of thing
okay all

656
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:13,279
okay all
 

657
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,430
okay all
right it's the same exact forces we just

658
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
right it's the same exact forces we just
