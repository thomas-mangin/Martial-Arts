00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,710
that makes total sense doesn't it
so

182
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720

it's because uh there's a lot of
uncertainty about

190
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
uncertainty about
 

191
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,470

00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

201
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,910

the hand comes out

202
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
the hand comes out
 

203
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,710
the hand comes out
so nargo initiates it

204
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
so nargo initiates it
 

205
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,749
so nargo initiates it
and you go forward towards okay

strongest mode
so from

256
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840

if you're doing humble style you would
 

263
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,390
if you're doing humble style you would
have an open hand

264
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
have an open hand
 

265
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,390
have an open hand
but then be careful that you don't rise

266
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
but then be careful that you don't rise
 

267

up because as you rise up
 

269
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,029
up because as you rise up
even though you're going to take them

270
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
even though you're going to take them
 

271
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,189
even though you're going to take them
down

272
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
down
 

273
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,909
down
remember

274
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
remember
 

275
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,749
remember
the higher you go

276
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
the higher you go
 

277
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,629
the higher you go
the weaker your arm

278
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
the weaker your arm
 

279
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,110
the weaker your arm
so you're actually reducing the amount

280
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
so you're actually reducing the amount
 

281
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,270
so you're actually reducing the amount
of power that you've got

282
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
of power that you've got
 

283
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,350
of power that you've got
so you do from here go up

284
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
so you do from here go up
 

285
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,870
so you do from here go up
but you do it

286
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
but you do it
 

287
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,350
but you do it
as you go over in to the eq position

288
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
as you go over in to the eq position
 

289
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,150
as you go over in to the eq position
where you're taking that balance

290
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
where you're taking that balance
 

291
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,430
where you're taking that balance
all right

292
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
all right
 

293
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,950
all right
if you go in too hard and fast it will

294
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
if you go in too hard and fast it will
 

295
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,110
if you go in too hard and fast it will
push the hands up

296
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
push the hands up
 

297
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,830
push the hands up
naturally

298
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
naturally
 

299
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,390
naturally
because

300
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
because
 

301
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,309
because
clashing together

302

clashing together
 

303
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,870
clashing together
you'll both be weak

304
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
you'll both be weak
 

305
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,350
you'll both be weak
if one is stronger than the other

306
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
if one is stronger than the other
 

307
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,430
if one is stronger than the other
then it's still a clash and that's not

308
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
then it's still a clash and that's not
 

309
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,749
then it's still a clash and that's not

if you do this you will retain your

350
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
if you do this you will retain your
 

351
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,830
if you do this you will retain your
power

352
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840

 

353
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,230

and then your power because it has

354
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
and then your power because it has
 

355
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,150
and then your power because it has
strong power base it can project project

356
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
strong power base it can project project
 

357
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,670
strong power base it can project project
from this point

358
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
from this point
 

359
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,909
from this point
but you have to remember to catch them

360
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
but you have to remember to catch them
 

361
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,390
but you have to remember to catch them
or with open hands you have to make the

362
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
or with open hands you have to make the
 

363
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,430
or with open hands you have to make the
circle

364
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
circle
 

365
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,029
circle
so that you

366
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
so that you
 

367
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,550
so that you
keep together with them

368
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560

 

369
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,390

so

370
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
so
 

371
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,189
so
i find that uh most people

372
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
i find that uh most people
 

373
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,869
i find that uh most people
overcome the omote iccio but when it

374
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
overcome the omote iccio but when it
 

375
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,510
overcome the omote iccio but when it
comes to the ura ekyo

376
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
comes to the ura ekyo
 

377
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,230
comes to the ura ekyo
especially from shamanucci

378
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
especially from shamanucci
 

379
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,270
especially from shamanucci
they

380
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
they
 

381
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,830
they
they can't do it it's as if

382
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
they can't do it it's as if
 

383
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,990
they can't do it it's as if
they're pushing

384
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
they're pushing
 

385
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,670
they're pushing
and the reach

386
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
and the reach
 

387
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,869
and the reach
becomes too far

388
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
becomes too far
 

389
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,350
becomes too far
so i'm going to give you an example here

390
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
so i'm going to give you an example here
 

391
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,830
so i'm going to give you an example here
if you've ever stood on a pair of steps

392
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
if you've ever stood on a pair of steps
 

393
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,430
if you've ever stood on a pair of steps
and you're trying to reach something

394
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
and you're trying to reach something
 

395
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,070
and you're trying to reach something
there's a comfortable

there's a comfortable
 

397
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,350
there's a comfortable
place

398
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
place
 

399
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,149
place
on the steps where you can either fix a

400
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
on the steps where you can either fix a
 

401
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,029
on the steps where you can either fix a
light bulb or you can do something

light bulb or you can do something
 

403
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,149
light bulb or you can do something
and there's that the next stage is where

404
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
and there's that the next stage is where
 

405
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,389
and there's that the next stage is where
your your your maximum stretch

406
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
your your your maximum stretch
 

407
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,230
your your your maximum stretch
if you're too high on the eq one once

408
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
if you're too high on the eq one once
 

409
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,430
if you're too high on the eq one once
you've come together if the pushing up

410
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
you've come together if the pushing up
 

411
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,550
you've come together if the pushing up
or the

412
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
or the
 

413
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,070
or the
or the from here you go to high in the

then

418
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
then
 

419
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,910
then
that's what happens with the ura you're

420
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
that's what happens with the ura you're
 

421

that's what happens with the ura you're
not keeping it constant and you're not

by steps

496
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
by steps
 

497
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,910
by steps
you're comfortably

498
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
you're comfortably
 

499
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,310
you're comfortably
changing a light bulb or you know

500
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
changing a light bulb or you know
 

501
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,790
changing a light bulb or you know
screwing something in and it's all very

502
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
screwing something in and it's all very
 

503
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,310

comfortable and it's all organized
 

505
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,790
comfortable and it's all organized
and then the steps are

506
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
and then the steps are
 

507
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,790
and then the steps are
not tall enough

508
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
not tall enough
 

509
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,030
not tall enough
or you're over the banisters

510
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
or you're over the banisters
 

511
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,269
or you're over the banisters
and it then takes a little bit more

512
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
and it then takes a little bit more
 

513
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,389
and it then takes a little bit more
daring you're stretching your stretching

514
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
daring you're stretching your stretching
 

515
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,230
daring you're stretching your stretching
you can almost

516
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
you can almost
 

517
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,389
you can almost
do your work but it's very difficult but

518
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
do your work but it's very difficult but
 

519
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,790

it it's in the first stages and then

618
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
it it's in the first stages and then
 

619
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,550
it it's in the first stages and then
they start to lack competence because

620
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
they start to lack competence because
 

621
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,750
they start to lack competence because
they know

622

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,069
they know
that it feels like it's getting away

really in control anymore they're going
 

629
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,710
really in control anymore they're going
out

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
out
 

631
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,389

to have balance they have to go

636
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
to have balance they have to go
 

637
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,269
to have balance they have to go
past the limit of what is their natural

638
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
past the limit of what is their natural
 

639

comfort
but that means that you took your eye

642
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
but that means that you took your eye
 

643
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,230
but that means that you took your eye
off the ball for a moment and you went

644
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
off the ball for a moment and you went
 

645
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,509
off the ball for a moment and you went
outside your own sphere perhaps if you

646
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
outside your own sphere perhaps if you
 

647
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,310
outside your own sphere perhaps if you
know that there's a weakness coming up

648
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
know that there's a weakness coming up
 

649
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,350
know that there's a weakness coming up
perhaps you should start to curve that

650
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
perhaps you should start to curve that
 

651
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,829
perhaps you should start to curve that
sphere and actually make the sphere

652
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
sphere and actually make the sphere
 

653
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,110
sphere and actually make the sphere
smaller

654
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
smaller
 

655
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,870
smaller
not larger

656
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
not larger
 

657
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,949
not larger
perhaps you've got to start thinking

658
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
perhaps you've got to start thinking
 

659
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,590
perhaps you've got to start thinking
about doing the opposite to what your

660
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
about doing the opposite to what your
 

661
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,990
about doing the opposite to what your
mind is saying that you think you have

662
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
mind is saying that you think you have
 

663
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,350
mind is saying that you think you have
to do you see the stretch elastic bands

664
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
to do you see the stretch elastic bands
 

665
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,590
to do you see the stretch elastic bands
on and on and on and on and on in the

666
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
on and on and on and on and on in the
 

667
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,470
on and on and on and on and on in the
end if the elastic band will stretch

668
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
end if the elastic band will stretch
 

669
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,110
end if the elastic band will stretch
more than you can stretch

670
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
more than you can stretch
 

671
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,110
more than you can stretch
then you're defeated

672
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120

 

673
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,750

so it's the same with

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:14,760
so it's the same with

so

678
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
so
 

679
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,189
so
you can do a perfectly good aura

680
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
you can do a perfectly good aura
 

681
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,350
you can do a perfectly good aura
as long as you keep it within a sphere

682
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
as long as you keep it within a sphere
 

683
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,069
as long as you keep it within a sphere
of

684
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
of
 

685
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,470
of
a comfort zone

686
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
a comfort zone
 

687
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,629
a comfort zone
okay you'll have to trust me on this one

688
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
