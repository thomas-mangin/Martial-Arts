move because so let's do this slowly so

190
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:45,880
move because so let's do this slowly so

you see and then I can take the arm back
 

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,390
you see and then I can take the arm back
on the 180 which is no longer the 180

196
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
on the 180 which is no longer the 180
 

197
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,350
on the 180 which is no longer the 180
and that's going to be outside his basis

198
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
and that's going to be outside his basis

00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,400
you see that that's important because
 

203
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,909
you see that that's important because
the faster he's cutting down if you

204
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
the faster he's cutting down if you
 

205
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,309
the faster he's cutting down if you
think you're going to do these circles

you're crazy okay it's not going to
 

209
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,589
you're crazy okay it's not going to
happen so you move him and now 180 is

210
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:16,599
happen so you move him and now 180 is
 

211
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,029
happen so you move him and now 180 is
good to go for the kadushi angle okay

212
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
good to go for the kadushi angle okay
 

213
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,550
good to go for the kadushi angle okay
and you're pinning it pick it up that's

214
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
and you're pinning it pick it up that's
 

215
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,270
and you're pinning it pick it up that's
what you're doing you're not here

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919

 

233
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,670

again all right so this technique is

234
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
again all right so this technique is
 

235
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,070
again all right so this technique is
working on a person's reaction so

236
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
working on a person's reaction so
 

237
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,510
working on a person's reaction so
rewind the reaction of I'm shoving him

238
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
rewind the reaction of I'm shoving him
 

239
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,629
rewind the reaction of I'm shoving him
down he's going to pick it up

240
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:07,639
down he's going to pick it up
 

241
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,869
down he's going to pick it up
okay when you feel the resistance he

242
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:09,879
okay when you feel the resistance he
 

243
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,430
okay when you feel the resistance he
picks it up that's when I go you don't

244
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:12,440
picks it up that's when I go you don't

wrist okay up
turn down fix it up that's when you

250
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,159
turn down fix it up that's when you
 

251
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,629
turn down fix it up that's when you
go we're don't worry about the ending

252
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:25,639
go we're don't worry about the ending
 

253
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,110
go we're don't worry about the ending
now just

you go

326
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
you go
 

327
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,750
you go
back so when you seize this you have to

328
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:28,760
back so when you seize this you have to
 

329
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,389
back so when you seize this you have to
seize the the center you can't you can't

330
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
seize the the center you can't you can't
 

331
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,990
seize the the center you can't you can't
stay in the limb and it's going to lean

you have to seize the center so his

334
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
you have to seize the center so his
 

335
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,870
you have to seize the center so his
energy was coming up and that's what I'm

336
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:39,880
energy was coming up and that's what I'm
 

337
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,550
energy was coming up and that's what I'm
seizing that

338

391
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,550

doing so if you look at this

392
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
doing so if you look at this
 

393
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,509
doing so if you look at this
technique I have right angle on the

394
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
technique I have right angle on the
 

395
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,990
technique I have right angle on the
shoulder and on the elbow and on the

396
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
shoulder and on the elbow and on the
 

397
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,350
shoulder and on the elbow and on the
wrist so let's focus it on the wrist I

398
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
wrist so let's focus it on the wrist I
 

399
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,670
wrist so let's focus it on the wrist I
want this right angle and I'm pushing

400
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:36,680
want this right angle and I'm pushing
 

401
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,870
want this right angle and I'm pushing
that right

402
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:37,880
that right
 

403
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,269
that right
angle into the

404
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
angle into the
 

405
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,949
angle into the
technique so when we're

406
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:43,959
technique so when we're
 

407
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,870
technique so when we're
here and I come around it's just not

408
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:47,880
here and I come around it's just not
 

409
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,990
here and I come around it's just not
closed but it's right there but it's not

410
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000
closed but it's right there but it's not
 

411
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,470
closed but it's right there but it's not
closed don't come here there's no power

412
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:55,480
closed don't come here there's no power
 

413
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,110
closed don't come here there's no power
here here all I got to do is that

414
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,120
here here all I got to do is that
 

415
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,500
here here all I got to do is that
throw the right
