okay the same exact thing okay so let's
 

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,230
okay the same exact thing okay so let's
look at the knife again and uh do that

144
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
look at the knife again and uh do that
 

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,550
look at the knife again and uh do that
hand here I'm not getting off the line

and then turning over here the potential

148
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:45,960
and then turning over here the potential
 

149
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,390
and then turning over here the potential
thrust point and my target potential

150
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
thrust point and my target potential
 

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,189
thrust point and my target potential
that's what rotates around each other

you want to train slow I don't have a
 

205
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,150
you want to train slow I don't have a
problem with that but then the UK is got

206
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
problem with that but then the UK is got
 

207
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,589
problem with that but then the UK is got
to pick up and mimic the inertia okay so

208
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
to pick up and mimic the inertia okay so
 

209
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,430
to pick up and mimic the inertia okay so
on on this next point right

made that correction they're going to go

304
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,160
made that correction they're going to go
 

305
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,550
made that correction they're going to go
past they'll go past or they'll stop

306

that you won't have their opposing force

308
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480
that you won't have their opposing force
 

309
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,069
that you won't have their opposing force
on your strike which would increase your

310
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
on your strike which would increase your
 

311
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,629
on your strike which would increase your
impact got it they'll also counter

impact got it they'll also counter
 

313
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,030
impact got it they'll also counter
they'll move they'll do something

314
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040
they'll move they'll do something
 

315
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,190
they'll move they'll do something
because they they fin attack now they

316
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,200
because they they fin attack now they
 

317
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,269
because they they fin attack now they
can counter attack your counter but if

318
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:02,279
can counter attack your counter but if
 

319
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,069
can counter attack your counter but if
you hit them while they're attacking you

320
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
you hit them while they're attacking you
 

321
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,990
you hit them while they're attacking you
they're going to keep attacking you then

322
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
they're going to keep attacking you then
 

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,790
they're going to keep attacking you then
you get a free shot okay so watch how

324
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
you get a free shot okay so watch how
 

325
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,750
you get a free shot okay so watch how
much you deviate but don't under deviate

326
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
much you deviate but don't under deviate
 

327
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,150
much you deviate but don't under deviate
because if you don't if you get stabbed

328
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
because if you don't if you get stabbed
 

329
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,790
because if you don't if you get stabbed
that's the end of the technique too okay
