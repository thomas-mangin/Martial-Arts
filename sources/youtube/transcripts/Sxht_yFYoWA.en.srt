1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,690

okay so again the same thing that I

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:02,700
okay so again the same thing that I
 

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,450
okay so again the same thing that I
always say there's not two Arts okay so

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,460
always say there's not two Arts okay so
 

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,350
always say there's not two Arts okay so
as we come in already I reconciling my

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
as we come in already I reconciling my
 

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,650
as we come in already I reconciling my
materiality my energy that is working

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:12,660
materiality my energy that is working
 

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,690
materiality my energy that is working
through me going through my body onto

10
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:14,700
through me going through my body onto
 

11
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,230
through me going through my body onto
the ground vectors as we come in then I

12
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
the ground vectors as we come in then I
 

13
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,310
the ground vectors as we come in then I
yield so here's my angle change

14
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
yield so here's my angle change
 

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,290
yield so here's my angle change
my angle change

16
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,300
my angle change
 

17
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,290
my angle change
right but I'm not just trying to get out

18
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:30,300

 

19
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,350

so as as I change my angle in other

20
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
so as as I change my angle in other
 

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,270
so as as I change my angle in other
words I don't leave his body there his

22
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
words I don't leave his body there his
 

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,490
words I don't leave his body there his
body's moving with me you see

24
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
body's moving with me you see
 

25
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,270
body's moving with me you see
with my with my adhesions

26
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
with my with my adhesions
 

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,430
with my with my adhesions
so if that doesn't change as I come

28
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
so if that doesn't change as I come
 

29
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,389
so if that doesn't change as I come
around

30
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
around
 

31
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,450
around
his body is his body is in is in me and

okay okay so already reconciling my own
 

51
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,210
okay okay so already reconciling my own
energy connecting to his energy and

52
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:41,220
energy connecting to his energy and

you again to as you feel his mass that
energy too has to be internalized

74
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,220

 

75
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,330

wrist lock and he pulls his arm out now

96
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,000
wrist lock and he pulls his arm out now
 

97
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,290
wrist lock and he pulls his arm out now
because he's he's trying to do uh

98
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,300
because he's he's trying to do uh

his stuff and you know create openings
 

101
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,330
his stuff and you know create openings
do you see that as he has to protect

102
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,340
do you see that as he has to protect
 

103

do you see that as he has to protect
himself okay you understand that so the

104
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:07,620
himself okay you understand that so the
 

105
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,250
himself okay you understand that so the
same thing like on the

106
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,260
same thing like on the
 

107
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,290
same thing like on the
on the ground

108
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:12,300
on the ground
 

109
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,750
on the ground
right and uh

110
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,760
right and uh
 

111
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,809
right and uh
let's say uh I'm doing this kind of

112
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:17,819
let's say uh I'm doing this kind of
 

113

let's say uh I'm doing this kind of
stuff right and he's got no choice but

114
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,940
stuff right and he's got no choice but
 

115
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,790
stuff right and he's got no choice but
to try to create space with the other

116
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
to try to create space with the other
 

117
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,250
to try to create space with the other
arm because I'm pinning it and he's got

118
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
arm because I'm pinning it and he's got
 

119
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,130
arm because I'm pinning it and he's got
no space here so as he goes to create

120
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,140
no space here so as he goes to create
 

121
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,350
no space here so as he goes to create
space well that's where I'm attacking

122
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,360
space well that's where I'm attacking
 

123
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,290
space well that's where I'm attacking
the wrist you see and so from that from

124
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,300
the wrist you see and so from that from
 

125
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,930
the wrist you see and so from that from
that wrist attack I'm still attacking

126
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:35,940
that wrist attack I'm still attacking
 

127
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,890
that wrist attack I'm still attacking
the wrist

128
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:36,900
the wrist
 

129
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,250
the wrist
DC as I'm going into the mount it is

130
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,260
DC as I'm going into the mount it is
 

131
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,750
DC as I'm going into the mount it is
much easier mount

132
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
much easier mount
 

133
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,369
much easier mount
then I'm kind of now and he has pure 100

134
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:45,379
then I'm kind of now and he has pure 100
 

135
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,170
then I'm kind of now and he has pure 100
defense you got that

136
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,180
defense you got that
 

137
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,670
defense you got that
Okay so

138
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
Okay so
 

139
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,610
Okay so
on this one we'll go slow but it's the

140
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
on this one we'll go slow but it's the
 

141
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,110
on this one we'll go slow but it's the
same thing

142
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
same thing
 

143
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,649
same thing
take the yin space

144
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:57,659
take the yin space
 

145
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,670

the action here
 

151
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,990
the action here
instead of stepping in to attack the leg

152
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,000
instead of stepping in to attack the leg
 

153
