you I don't want to
see this external

412
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
see this external
 

413
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,750
see this external
thing

414
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:56,760

 

415
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,669

okay same here if you're going to

416
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:00,679
okay same here if you're going to
 

417
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,070
okay same here if you're going to
practice maybe don't

418
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,080
practice maybe don't
 

419
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,270
practice maybe don't
complete the arm

420
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
complete the arm
 

421
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,549
complete the arm
movement do you understand reduce the

422
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
movement do you understand reduce the
 

423
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:21,950
movement do you understand reduce the
arm

424
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960

 

425
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,230

movement s

426
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,240

 

427
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,029

here

428
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
here
 

429
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,830
here
same thing tension on instead

430
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:32,840
same thing tension on instead
 

431
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:47,390
same thing tension on instead
of here maybe reduce it a

432
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,400

 

433
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,350

little get it so your kid see if you're

434
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,360
little get it so your kid see if you're
 

435
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,230
little get it so your kid see if you're
doing it or not okay let's try

436
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240

 

437
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,870

me

438
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
me
 

439
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,430
me
so

440
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440

 

441
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,710

um that's external and you're I'm

442
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:07,720
um that's external and you're I'm
 

443
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,070
um that's external and you're I'm
stronger than

444
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,080
stronger than
 

445
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,470
stronger than
you I'm just throwing it around and you

446
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:13,480
you I'm just throwing it around and you
 

447
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,149
you I'm just throwing it around and you
know don't lay down on the ground too

448
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:15,159
know don't lay down on the ground too
 

449
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,240
know don't lay down on the ground too
long with your back you know what I mean

450
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,250
long with your back you know what I mean
 

451

long with your back you know what I mean
[Music]

452
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:27,159
[Music]
 

453
00:20:27,159 --> 00:21:13,430
[Music]
okay

454
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440

 

455
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,269

that's thei all right so what is it the

456
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:17,279
that's thei all right so what is it the
 

457
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,630
that's thei all right so what is it the
kazushi is

458
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640

 

459
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,470

this when you push and I

460
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
this when you push and I
 

461
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,549
this when you push and I
yield until you let basic basically I'm

462
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
yield until you let basic basically I'm
 

463
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,029
yield until you let basic basically I'm
not touching your Center but by yielding

464
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
not touching your Center but by yielding
 

465
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,269
not touching your Center but by yielding
then I have your

466
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:32,279
then I have your
 

467
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,390
then I have your
Center that's

468
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
Center that's
 

469
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,269
Center that's
kazushi so

470
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:36,279
kazushi so
 

471
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,310
kazushi so
even when we're

472
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
even when we're
 

473
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,549
even when we're
here there we

474
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
here there we
 

475
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,870
here there we
are I am in control you're not tilted

476
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
are I am in control you're not tilted
 

477
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,029
are I am in control you're not tilted
you see and your line of gravity is not

478
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:46,039
you see and your line of gravity is not
 

479
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,590
you see and your line of gravity is not
outside your base of support

480
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600
outside your base of support
 

481
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,630
outside your base of support
but let's do this you if you go you can

482
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
but let's do this you if you go you can
 

483
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,029
but let's do this you if you go you can
let go if you

484
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
let go if you
 

485
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,870
let go if you
want

486
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
want
 

487
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,549
want
but you didn't want to did you because

488
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
but you didn't want to did you because
 

489
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,590
but you didn't want to did you because
what did you

490
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
what did you
 

491
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,110
what did you
feel you're going to feel that yeah you

492
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
feel you're going to feel that yeah you
 

493
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,950
feel you're going to feel that yeah you
got it I'm going to punch the out

494
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
got it I'm going to punch the out
 

495
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,789
got it I'm going to punch the out
of you do you understand so what do you

496
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:09,799
of you do you understand so what do you
 

497
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,789
of you do you understand so what do you
do

498
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:11,799
do
 

499
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,149
do
instead I have a center you understand

500
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:15,159
instead I have a center you understand
 

501
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,590
instead I have a center you understand
he started like go I don't know if you

502
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:16,600
he started like go I don't know if you
 

503
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,669
he started like go I don't know if you
can see it but he can feel my ill

504
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
can see it but he can feel my ill
 

505
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,230
can see it but he can feel my ill
will coming at him you don't know that's

506
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
will coming at him you don't know that's
 

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,430
will coming at him you don't know that's
position not the tilting I use that to

508
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:28,440
position not the tilting I use that to
 

509
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,269
position not the tilting I use that to
tilt you do you understand so the

510
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:31,279
tilt you do you understand so the
 

511
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,789
tilt you do you understand so the
tilting is an

512
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:33,799
tilting is an
 

513
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,430
tilting is an
external consequence of kazushi which is

514
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
external consequence of kazushi which is
 

515
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,510
external consequence of kazushi which is
where I touch your Center by non-

516
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,520
where I touch your Center by non-
 

517
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,110
where I touch your Center by non-
contesting the young aspect of your

518
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,120
contesting the young aspect of your
 

519
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,830
contesting the young aspect of your
prescribed pressure okay so you're going

520
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,840
prescribed pressure okay so you're going
 

521
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,590
prescribed pressure okay so you're going
to do that technique I had to do

522
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,600
to do that technique I had to do
 

523
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,470
to do that technique I had to do
this that's what I have you feel it

524
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
this that's what I have you feel it
 

525

again I going move
 

527
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,470
again I going move
you you want to let go let go if you

528
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
you you want to let go let go if you
 

529
