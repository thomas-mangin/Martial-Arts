we went up and down um in opposite

20
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
we went up and down um in opposite
 

21
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,310
we went up and down um in opposite

from side to side in opposite directions
 

25
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,189
from side to side in opposite directions
so one goes up one goes down and then

26
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:26,199
so one goes up one goes down and then
 

27
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,390

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,310
you're doing is moving your hands up and
down and then turning with your waist

42
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
down and then turning with your waist
 

43
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,069

rails so let's take a look at that going
 

187
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,149
rails so let's take a look at that going
the opposite direction doing inward

00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:33,159
the opposite direction doing inward
 

189
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,670
the opposite direction doing inward
rails so going inwards now it'll be the

190
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
rails so going inwards now it'll be the
 

191
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,589
rails so going inwards now it'll be the
opposite hand that's going upwards and

192
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:38,599
opposite hand that's going upwards and
 

193
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,350
opposite hand that's going upwards and
doing the Reel at the

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:40,360
doing the Reel at the
 

195
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,429
doing the Reel at the
top you still want to make sure you're

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,200
points once you happy with that movement
 

201
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,480
points once you happy with that movement
you can start to smooth it
