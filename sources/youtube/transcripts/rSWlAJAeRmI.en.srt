I'll put my knife in my left pocket and
then I'll put it in the right pocket so

16
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,640
then I'll put it in the right pocket so
 

17
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,670
then I'll put it in the right pocket so
my hold is usually one on support side

18
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:24,680
my hold is usually one on support side
 

19
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,230
my hold is usually one on support side
and then one in the center Center Line

20
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
and then one in the center Center Line
 

21
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,269
and then one in the center Center Line
uh going down so is it different okay

22
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
uh going down so is it different okay
 

23
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,869
uh going down so is it different okay
that way in the center line one I have

24
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:33,879
that way in the center line one I have
 

25
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,950
that way in the center line one I have
my right hand available for that one but

26
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:35,960
my right hand available for that one but
 

27
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,069
my right hand available for that one but
if I can't get to my pocket my left hand

00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
if I can't get to my pocket my left hand
 

29
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,150
if I can't get to my pocket my left hand
can also draw it too and then as I said

30
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,160
can also draw it too and then as I said
 

31
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,910
can also draw it too and then as I said

pens that double as spikes okay um then
 

39
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,750
pens that double as spikes okay um then
the other thing that we're talking about

40
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
the other thing that we're talking about
 

41
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,270
the other thing that we're talking about

here is or or what that allows you to do
is you don't have to pick a technique

44
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
is you don't have to pick a technique
 

45
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,789
is you don't have to pick a technique
that gets you to your weapon you now can

46
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
that gets you to your weapon you now can
 

47
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,870
that gets you to your weapon you now can
work any technique and you go to the

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,030
weapon that that technique opens for you
okay so today we're just going to work

52
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
okay so today we're just going to work
 

53
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,510
okay so today we're just going to work
with support side okay for me and you

54
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,520
with support side okay for me and you
 

55
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,190
with support side okay for me and you
guys will work uh strong side if your

56
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
guys will work uh strong side if your
 

57
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,830
guys will work uh strong side if your
right handed so you'll work that right

58
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:20,840
right handed so you'll work that right
 

59
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,910
right handed so you'll work that right
pocket okay if you have a

60
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
pocket okay if you have a
 

61
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,109
pocket okay if you have a
shirt you're going to have to do a

62
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
shirt you're going to have to do a
 

63
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,350
shirt you're going to have to do a
two-handed move which is going to take

64
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,360
two-handed move which is going to take
 

65
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,429
two-handed move which is going to take
away from some of this okay okay but if

66
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
away from some of this okay okay but if
 

67
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,230
away from some of this okay okay but if
sometimes if you're wearing like a long

68
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240
sometimes if you're wearing like a long
 

69
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,109
sometimes if you're wearing like a long
shirt uh it'll Jack it up if you try to

70
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,119
shirt uh it'll Jack it up if you try to
 

71
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,590
shirt uh it'll Jack it up if you try to
do that so you'll always be faster by

72
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,600
do that so you'll always be faster by
 

73
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,630
do that so you'll always be faster by
grabbing the shirt and exaggeratedly

74
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
grabbing the shirt and exaggeratedly
 

75
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,149
grabbing the shirt and exaggeratedly
pulling that thing up cuz under stress a

76
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
pulling that thing up cuz under stress a
 

77
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,550
pulling that thing up cuz under stress a
little is never enough so you pull it up

78
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
little is never enough so you pull it up
 

79
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,789
little is never enough so you pull it up
and then you would draw the weapon okay

80
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
and then you would draw the weapon okay
 

81
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,550
and then you would draw the weapon okay
got it there's two moose okay which

82
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,560
got it there's two moose okay which
 

83
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,550
got it there's two moose okay which
again you're going to have to generate

84
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
again you're going to have to generate
 

85
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,709
again you're going to have to generate
space and time for that and angle for

86
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:55,719
space and time for that and angle for
 

87
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,389
space and time for that and angle for
that because two hands are going to be

88
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:57,399
that because two hands are going to be
 

89
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,749
that because two hands are going to be
occupied on the draw stroke okay

90
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:00,759
occupied on the draw stroke okay
 

91
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,550
occupied on the draw stroke okay
any other questions on

92
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
any other questions on
 

93
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,910
any other questions on
this okay

94
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:06,920

 

95
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,469

uh when it comes to

96
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:09,479
uh when it comes to
 

97
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,630
uh when it comes to
weapons uh you have to deal with

98
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
weapons uh you have to deal with
 

99
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,510
weapons uh you have to deal with
retention issues and the best way of

100
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
retention issues and the best way of
 

101
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,550
retention issues and the best way of
dealing with retention issues is uh

102
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
dealing with retention issues is uh
 

103
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,949
dealing with retention issues is uh
being out of range that would cause them

104
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:19,959
being out of range that would cause them
 

105
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,470
being out of range that would cause them
and that's where your iido Kona is so

106
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:23,480
and that's where your iido Kona is so
 

107
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,190
and that's where your iido Kona is so
it's all

108
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
it's all
 

109
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,390
it's all
assuming that you have a weapon all the

110
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
assuming that you have a weapon all the
 

111
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,750
assuming that you have a weapon all the
the Tactical spectrum of waza is

112
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
the Tactical spectrum of waza is
 

113
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,509
the Tactical spectrum of waza is
assuming you have weapons on you okay um

114
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
assuming you have weapons on you okay um
 

115
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,270
assuming you have weapons on you okay um
and so this drill you'll see uh is

116
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
and so this drill you'll see uh is
 

117
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,309
and so this drill you'll see uh is
probably going to open itself up more to

118
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
probably going to open itself up more to
 

119
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,550
probably going to open itself up more to
your iido Kon waza uh than some of the

120
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,560
your iido Kon waza uh than some of the
 

121
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,630
your iido Kon waza uh than some of the
other live training environments that we

122
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:47,640
other live training environments that we
 

123
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,589
other live training environments that we
use okay so um let's just say uh I'll

124
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:52,599
use okay so um let's just say uh I'll
 

125
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,390
use okay so um let's just say uh I'll
demonstrate that now so he he'll do some

126
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
demonstrate that now so he he'll do some
 

127
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,309
demonstrate that now so he he'll do some
sort of Ambush attack and make it kind

128
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
sort of Ambush attack and make it kind
 

129
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,869
sort of Ambush attack and make it kind
of aggressive okay they make it kind of

130
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
of aggressive okay they make it kind of
 

131
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,270
of aggressive okay they make it kind of
aggressive I don't want to try and draw

132
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
aggressive I don't want to try and draw
 

133
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,990
aggressive I don't want to try and draw
this weapon from in here you see it's

134
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
this weapon from in here you see it's
 

135
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,670
this weapon from in here you see it's
not that I can't but it's very risky

136
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
not that I can't but it's very risky
 

137
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,309
not that I can't but it's very risky
that I could get disarmed here okay so

138
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
that I could get disarmed here okay so
 

139
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,509
that I could get disarmed here okay so
instead right I can use my technique and

140
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:16,519
instead right I can use my technique and
 

141
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,030
instead right I can use my technique and
then I now have my drawability and he

142
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
then I now have my drawability and he
 

143
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,070
then I now have my drawability and he
gets to decide whether he wants to come

144
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
gets to decide whether he wants to come
 

145
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,990
gets to decide whether he wants to come
in like that or not but I've greatly

146
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
in like that or not but I've greatly
 

147
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,949
in like that or not but I've greatly
increased my advantage without any risk

148
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
increased my advantage without any risk
 

149
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,429
increased my advantage without any risk
if we're here

150
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:30,439
if we're here
 

151
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,910
if we're here
and I draw my weapon and he oh crap and

152
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
and I draw my weapon and he oh crap and
 

153
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,030
and I draw my weapon and he oh crap and
now you see now now we're we're battling

154
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,040
now you see now now we're we're battling
 

155
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:49,110
now you see now now we're we're battling
over weapon retention

156
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120

 

157
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,069

okay so again as he's coming in I don't

158
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:52,079
okay so again as he's coming in I don't
 

159
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,869
okay so again as he's coming in I don't
want to try to do

160
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:53,879
want to try to do
 

161
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,750
want to try to do

167
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,590

okay you have your two basic techniques

168
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:24,600
okay you have your two basic techniques

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,590
okay you have your two basic techniques
external and internal distance

170
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
external and internal distance

173
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,629

so external line is that I

174
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
so external line is that I
 

175
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,909
so external line is that I
move I move pull and

176
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:44,919
move I move pull and
 

177
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,590
move I move pull and
draw and the internal one is a

178
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
draw and the internal one is a
 

179
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,430
draw and the internal one is a
projection and now you have your

180
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,440
projection and now you have your
 

181
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,749
projection and now you have your
distance okay uh so let's deal with that

182
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:54,759
distance okay uh so let's deal with that
 

183
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,110

the two of them that they're contained

524
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,520
the two of them that they're contained
 

525
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,470
the two of them that they're contained
in each other okay but when it comes to

526
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:13,480
in each other okay but when it comes to
 

527
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,549
in each other okay but when it comes to
learning and

528
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
learning and
 

529
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,710
learning and
training if you slowly rely on the

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:19,720
training if you slowly rely on the
 

531
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,430
training if you slowly rely on the
external it it'll almost negate your

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
external it it'll almost negate your
 

533
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,350
external it it'll almost negate your
internal okay so uh if he starts coming

534
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
internal okay so uh if he starts coming
 

535
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,110
internal okay so uh if he starts coming

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,240
dynamic situation to get a
 

555
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,510
dynamic situation to get a
projection but I can't be running around

556
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:04,520
projection but I can't be running around
 

557
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,110

whichever foot I can and then you can

564
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:19,559
whichever foot I can and then you can
 

565
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,510
whichever foot I can and then you can
get the projection then you get the

566
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
get the projection then you get the
 

567
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,630
get the projection then you get the
distance okay so what was happening to

568
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
distance okay so what was happening to
 

569
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,310
distance okay so what was happening to
you which is not it's not bad it it

570
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,320
you which is not it's not bad it it
 

571
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,669

here you're trying to do different moves

574
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
here you're trying to do different moves
 

575
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,750

it'll

576
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:34,760
it'll
 

577
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,070
it'll
work right yeah okay it'll it'll work

you're moving but you're

588
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
you're moving but you're
 

589
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,950

uh being able to ground and get get that

592
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:57,880
uh being able to ground and get get that
 

593
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,669
uh being able to ground and get get that
rebounding energy okay got it do you

594
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:00,679
rebounding energy okay got it do you
 

595
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:09,029
rebounding energy okay got it do you
guys see that okay um I

596
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039

 

597
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,350

usein so that's the C on the I part is

598
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,360
usein so that's the C on the I part is
 

599
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,310
usein so that's the C on the I part is
when she comes remember she's going to

I don't care what it is okay so um you
 

605
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,710
I don't care what it is okay so um you
know even if I go she goes and I see the

606
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
know even if I go she goes and I see the
 

607
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,310
know even if I go she goes and I see the
opening

608
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
opening
 

609
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,870
opening
boom okay cool but we wanted to try and

610
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
boom okay cool but we wanted to try and
 

611
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,590
boom okay cool but we wanted to try and
move we did the atmi stuff already and

612
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
move we did the atmi stuff already and
 

613
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,310
move we did the atmi stuff already and
now we're trying to do the internal

614
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,320
now we're trying to do the internal
 

615
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,230
now we're trying to do the internal
stuff so you're going to reach for

616
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,240
stuff so you're going to reach for
 

617
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,029
stuff so you're going to reach for
whatever I'm not going to shove for good

618
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:44,039
whatever I'm not going to shove for good
 

619
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,230
whatever I'm not going to shove for good
form so she kind of compressed me here

620
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,240
form so she kind of compressed me here
 

621
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,230
form so she kind of compressed me here
you see and on this side I have this

622
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
you see and on this side I have this
 

623
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,430
you see and on this side I have this
head I have the inside of the arm here

00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
head I have the inside of the arm here
 

625
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,269
head I have the inside of the arm here
and we'll turn the other way so camera

626
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:56,279
and we'll turn the other way so camera
 

627
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,029
and we'll turn the other way so camera
can see and and I have this part of my

628
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:00,039
can see and and I have this part of my
 

629
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,909
can see and and I have this part of my
forearm and my elbow and here and those

forearm and my elbow and here and those
 

631
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,909
forearm and my elbow and here and those
things are are sticking on her you think

632
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
things are are sticking on her you think
 

633
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,870
things are are sticking on her you think
you get it so now now she pushes and now

634
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
you get it so now now she pushes and now
 

635
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,509
you get it so now now she pushes and now
I'm trying that footwork around and but

636
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:13,519
I'm trying that footwork around and but
 

637
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,549
I'm trying that footwork around and but
I'm sticking to her so I'm

638
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559

 

639
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,750

sticking got got it so I saw you guys

640
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
sticking got got it so I saw you guys
 

641
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,950
sticking got got it so I saw you guys
reaching out but just like your footwork

642
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
reaching out but just like your footwork
 

643
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,590
reaching out but just like your footwork
was external your hand work was external

644
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
was external your hand work was external
 

645
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,590
was external your hand work was external
too and it's just like ah it's not going

646
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
too and it's just like ah it's not going
 

647
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,630
too and it's just like ah it's not going
to work okay so right when she starts

648
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:33,640
to work okay so right when she starts
 

649
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,750
to work okay so right when she starts
you're you're already stuck okay she's

650
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:36,760
you're you're already stuck okay she's
 

651
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,549
you're you're already stuck okay she's
going to resist she's going to ground

652
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
going to resist she's going to ground
 

653
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,909
going to resist she's going to ground
and do whatever not lose her balance it

654
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:40,919
and do whatever not lose her balance it
 

655
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,950
and do whatever not lose her balance it
doesn't matter okay but you have to do

656
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:43,960
doesn't matter okay but you have to do
 

657
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,430
doesn't matter okay but you have to do
that so as fast as she goes you stick

658
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
that so as fast as she goes you stick
 

659
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,990
that so as fast as she goes you stick
however it is so I have friction on the

660
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,000
however it is so I have friction on the
 

661
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,590
however it is so I have friction on the
outside hip here behind the arm here and

662
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
outside hip here behind the arm here and
 

663
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,470
outside hip here behind the arm here and
I stick okay there we do that again pull

664
00:28:59,470 --> 00:28:59,480
I stick okay there we do that again pull
 

665
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,990
I stick okay there we do that again pull
up and it's enough to get the projection

666
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
up and it's enough to get the projection
 

667
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,149
up and it's enough to get the projection
out okay do you guys understand that so

668
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:05,159
out okay do you guys understand that so
 

669
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,149
out okay do you guys understand that so
you

670
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
you
 

671
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,310
you
can't go she goes in your here cuz this

672
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
can't go she goes in your here cuz this
 

673
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,710
can't go she goes in your here cuz this
is an external thing you see and I don't

674
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
is an external thing you see and I don't
 

675
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,669
is an external thing you see and I don't
you you're much more maneuverable around

676
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:14,679
you you're much more maneuverable around
 

677
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,710
you you're much more maneuverable around
here you see that but instead right on

678
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:17,720
