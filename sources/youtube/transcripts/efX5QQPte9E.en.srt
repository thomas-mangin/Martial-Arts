00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
just picking up you you have enough
 

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,190
just picking up you you have enough
right use momentum right there but when

44
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,200
right use momentum right there but when
 

45
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,710
right use momentum right there but when
you lift the

46
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720

 

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,469

leg okay so not all of you can take your

one up just sort of
 

55
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,029
one up just sort of
push then draw your

56
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:56,039

 

57
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,429

weon in that corner ride the energy

58
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:00,439
weon in that corner ride the energy
 

59
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,310
weon in that corner ride the energy
lift draw the weapon back to a grip Dr

60
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
lift draw the weapon back to a grip Dr
 

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:52,350

okay let's go

62
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,360

 

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:03,470

in all right pull down right here

64
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480

 

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,190

cuz you don't want you don't want to be

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
cuz you don't want you don't want to be
 

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,070
cuz you don't want you don't want to be
here you see so you have to immediately

68
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
here you see so you have to immediately
 

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,229
here you see so you have to immediately
get the centrifugal energy going and the

70
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
get the centrifugal energy going and the
 

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,550
get the centrifugal energy going and the
angle

72
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:11,560
angle
 

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:22,149
angle
cancellation so here

74
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159

 

75
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,470

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:04:27,670

slow okay let's go

78
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680

 

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,710

see I'm right here

80
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720

 

81
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,070

not out

82
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080

 

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:51,760

here

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:51,770

okay see how I I already have you okay
 

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,469
okay see how I I already have you okay
then your energy is taking me so I move

90
00:04:59,469 --> 00:04:59,479
then your energy is taking me so I move
 

91
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,550
then your energy is taking me so I move
out the way of the

92
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560

 

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,710

energy don't think you're going to is a

94
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
energy don't think you're going to is a
 

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,670
energy don't think you're going to is a
punch and you're going to stay there

96
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:06,680
punch and you're going to stay there
 

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,110
punch and you're going to stay there
he's bigger than you you're going to go

98
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,120
he's bigger than you you're going to go
 

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,749
he's bigger than you you're going to go
that way you understand so you deviate

100
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
that way you understand so you deviate
 

101
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,270
that way you understand so you deviate
it then the energy is coming in so you

102
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
it then the energy is coming in so you
 

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,469
it then the energy is coming in so you
move out of the

104
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
move out of the
 

105
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:51,309
move out of the
way okay let's go

106
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,319

 

107
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,380

00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759

 

121
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,080

okay let's
