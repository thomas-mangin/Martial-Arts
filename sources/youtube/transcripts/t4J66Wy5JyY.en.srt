me of you wants to talk about where it's

me of you wants to talk about where it's
 

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,870
me of you wants to talk about where it's
just page after page so seeing it as a

00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
just page after page so seeing it as a

yeah it's I think the analogy of the

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,759
yeah it's I think the analogy of the

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,260
not I'm trying not to focus on just

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,060
changing the height of my body but
instead figuring out how do I achieve

that sense of sync yeah I had covers of

and when I do it like that I find I end

dropped the value of the mentor and a
mentoring system and that system has

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:07,419
Brazilian Jujitsu but I look at it the
 

623
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,570
Brazilian Jujitsu but I look at it the
other way because I've seen it happen

more so by the fact and I truly believe
 

647
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,820
more so by the fact and I truly believe
this that the finding of this thing that

648
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:04,830
this that the finding of this thing that
 

649
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:12,070
this that the finding of this thing that

structurally to self displacement and

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,810
structurally to self displacement and
self displacement is necessary for

is even a greater challenge to the skill
of self displacement which means if you

of self displacement which means if you

of self displacement which means if you
can hold it in an idealized form you may

not be able to hold it when someone's

721
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,730

we talked last week about feeling the

722
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:38,740
we talked last week about feeling the
 

723
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,919
we talked last week about feeling the
stones of the shower floor and the water

724
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:40,929
stones of the shower floor and the water
 

725
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,110
stones of the shower floor and the water
and all that self dysplasia you got get

726
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
and all that self dysplasia you got get
 

727
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,070
and all that self dysplasia you got get
out of the way

728
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
out of the way
 

729
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,750
out of the way
you're not in the way you're in the way

730
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
you're not in the way you're in the way
 

731
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,850
you're not in the way you're in the way
because you're like I gotta get to work

732
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:47,860
because you're like I gotta get to work
 

733
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:56,310
because you're like I gotta get to work
I could you're in the way so I think in

734
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
I could you're in the way so I think in
 

735
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,460
I could you're in the way so I think in
trying to feel you're actually trying to

736
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,470
trying to feel you're actually trying to
 

737
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,490
trying to feel you're actually trying to
regain your skill in self displacement

738
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,500
regain your skill in self displacement
 

739
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,110
regain your skill in self displacement
and so the art isn't really about the

740
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,120
and so the art isn't really about the
 

741
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,440
and so the art isn't really about the
architecture or even the power it's

742
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:13,450
architecture or even the power it's
 

743
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,760
architecture or even the power it's
about that skill in self displacement

744
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:16,770
about that skill in self displacement
 

745
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,659
about that skill in self displacement
this is what makes butoh a way it's not

746
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:21,669
this is what makes butoh a way it's not
 

747
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:26,970
this is what makes butoh a way it's not
just tidy or exercise
