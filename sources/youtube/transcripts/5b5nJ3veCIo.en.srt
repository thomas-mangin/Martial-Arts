00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,620
spiral going up that sends him back the
other way

166
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:13,630

 

167
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,710

here and this is fine what happens over

168
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
here and this is fine what happens over
 

169
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,320
here and this is fine what happens over
me

170
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,330

 

171
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:31,409

oh now we have contact then I follow

172
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:31,419
oh now we have contact then I follow
 

173
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:37,589
oh now we have contact then I follow
that in so I'm not pushing him down I'm

174
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:37,599
that in so I'm not pushing him down I'm
 

175
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,309
that in so I'm not pushing him down I'm
creating a geometry where he cannot

176
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:41,319
creating a geometry where he cannot
 

177
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,140
creating a geometry where he cannot
stand up any longer

178
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,150
stand up any longer
 

179
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,460
stand up any longer
so that's the tilt and then I step into

180
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,470
so that's the tilt and then I step into
 

181
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:57,480
so that's the tilt and then I step into
now with my body position in connection

182
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,490
now with my body position in connection
 

183
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,240
now with my body position in connection
the amount of pressure we discussed but

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,250
the amount of pressure we discussed but
 

185
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,050
the amount of pressure we discussed but
the pattern is a spiral going like this

186
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,060
the pattern is a spiral going like this
 

187
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,950
the pattern is a spiral going like this
this way till into the empty space this

188
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:13,960
this way till into the empty space this
 

189
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:26,459
this way till into the empty space this
tsuki behind him into the space position

190
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:26,469
tsuki behind him into the space position
 

191
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,899
tsuki behind him into the space position
you see how it's locked

192
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:27,909
you see how it's locked
 

193
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:36,930
you see how it's locked
Oh spiral into the space and we just

194
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:36,940
Oh spiral into the space and we just
 

195
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,550
Oh spiral into the space and we just
putting that together

196
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560

 

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,170

okay trying to get so sacred shape do

198
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,180
okay trying to get so sacred shape do
 

199
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,240
okay trying to get so sacred shape do
you understand it's not like this whoa

200
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,250
you understand it's not like this whoa
 

201
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:04,090
you understand it's not like this whoa
no here oh okay let's go so the initial

202
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,100
no here oh okay let's go so the initial
 

203
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,650
no here oh okay let's go so the initial
Kazushi is right there so I am NOT

204
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:09,660
Kazushi is right there so I am NOT
 

205
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,040
Kazushi is right there so I am NOT
throwing him I'm aiming the following

206
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,050
throwing him I'm aiming the following
 

207
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,820
throwing him I'm aiming the following
one remember that rule okay so if that's

208
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:16,830
one remember that rule okay so if that's
 

209
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,330
one remember that rule okay so if that's
the case I don't want to use hip

210
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
the case I don't want to use hip
 

211
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:28,070
the case I don't want to use hip
rotation don't use it it has nothing to

212
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
rotation don't use it it has nothing to
 

213
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,010
rotation don't use it it has nothing to
do with it and that reduces the torque

214
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,020
do with it and that reduces the torque
 

215
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,969
do with it and that reduces the torque
across all the sinews and fast shot and

216
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:34,979
across all the sinews and fast shot and
 

217
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,380
across all the sinews and fast shot and
in the front of your body

218
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,390
in the front of your body
 

219
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,330
in the front of your body
when you turn your body there's no

220
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,340
when you turn your body there's no
 

221
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,020
when you turn your body there's no
torque now and we want those tissues to

222
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,030
torque now and we want those tissues to
 

223
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,930
torque now and we want those tissues to
be torque so they get conditioned so

224
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:44,940
be torque so they get conditioned so
 

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,440
be torque so they get conditioned so
don't use your hips you're here just

226
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,450
don't use your hips you're here just
 

227
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:58,370
don't use your hips you're here just
take a stance then finish the torch no

228
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,380
take a stance then finish the torch no
 

229
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,130
take a stance then finish the torch no
like this don't do that you're going to

230
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,140
like this don't do that you're going to
 

231
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,720
like this don't do that you're going to
be pushing him boom into the free space

232
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:07,730
be pushing him boom into the free space
 

233
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,920
be pushing him boom into the free space
fish pull them the torque and you just

234
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:11,930
fish pull them the torque and you just
 

235
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,530
fish pull them the torque and you just
put get rid of all the seams

236
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,540

 

237
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,250

okay let's go

238
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,260

 

239
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,980

is your kids not going in the other

240
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:24,990
is your kids not going in the other
 

241
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,310
is your kids not going in the other
direction until you all had let's

242
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
direction until you all had let's
 

243
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,910
direction until you all had let's
started moving not with I see that and

244
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
started moving not with I see that and
 

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,220
started moving not with I see that and
that means that's a clash they need to

246
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,230
that means that's a clash they need to
 

247
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,890
that means that's a clash they need to
be going in the other direction at the

248
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:39,900
be going in the other direction at the
 

249
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,260
be going in the other direction at the
completion of the spiral room

250
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,270

 

251
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,860

so our drill is going to stop there

252
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:48,870
so our drill is going to stop there
 

253
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,920
so our drill is going to stop there
whether your hand at the top position

254
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:50,930
whether your hand at the top position
 

255
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,920
whether your hand at the top position
the whole connection and then you do the

256
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:54,930
the whole connection and then you do the
 

257
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,000
the whole connection and then you do the
spiral

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,010
spiral
 

259
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,440
spiral
it'll stop there right it's not going

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,450
it'll stop there right it's not going
 

261
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,690
it'll stop there right it's not going
that way so that's your draw want to see

262
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:05,700
that way so that's your draw want to see
 

263
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,100
that way so that's your draw want to see
everyone's hand at the top can't go
