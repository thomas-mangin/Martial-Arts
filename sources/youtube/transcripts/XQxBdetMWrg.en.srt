1
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,280
Jacques Payet, hello.

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Hello.

3
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
Thank you for welcoming me here today.

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,980
Thanks for coming and thanks for the opportunity.

5
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,580
So to begin,

6
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,100
I would like to know where and how you
started your martial arts practice.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,420
Since I was a kid, I've always been drawn to martial arts.

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,820
I think it's the influence of Bruce Lee.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,900
But as I was on La Réunion Island, there were only a few judo practitioners, and it was quite far

10
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,340
so it was practically impossible to find a teacher.

11
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,800
So I had to wait for my studies in Lyon.

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,520
After I left La Réunion, I spent maybe 4 or 5 years in Lyon

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,550
and from that point I started right away.

14
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,940
I started with kung fu, then I
did a little shotokan karate,

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,440
and then I started ju jutsu.

16
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:11,220
This is where one day, I saw an 8mm film of Shioda Gozo,

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,180
a little man who threw people much larger than him

18
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,820
while laughing.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,460
And I thought that it looked like magic and that I'd love to go see this if that was really it.

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,239
That's how at age 22, without knowing anything about Japan,

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,500
without knowing anyone there,

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,080
I decided in all my youth, out of pure madness,

23
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,380
to come to Japan and meet Shioda Sensei.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,580
You hadn't practiced aikido in France?

25
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
No.

26
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,620
Besides, I had a rather negative image of aikido,

27
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,420
it was too weak,

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,560
it wasn't manly enough.

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,020
I especially wanted to do ju jutsu, there is a lot of virility in there,

30
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,420
and I saw aikido as too soft.

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,020
Even as I saw that film in Japanese,

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,540
I didn't know it was aikido, I thought it was ju jutsu.

33
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,700
So I came here looking for: “Shioda Gozo, professor of ju jutsu. "

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,420
So obviously everyone is surprised.

35
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,140
And after that I understood of course that it was aikido, and that it was Yoshinkan.

36
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,980
So I think that if Shioda Sensei had done karate or something,

37
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,880
today I would have practiced his discipline.

38
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,940
OK. When I looked at your biography,

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,160
I was amazed that you went straight to Shioda Sensei, when anyone would have said:

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,240
“Well, Shioda Sensei is very good, he does aikido, I'm going to do aikido. "

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,800
That's right.

42
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,620
And even when you got to Tokyo, there were heaps of places where you could have done aikido, but you went straight away ...

43
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,540
No, I came for Shioda Sensei,

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,280
and so I really went through the small door.

45
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,000
I guess by "the small door", you mean, without any introduction...

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,440
Right, nothing at all.

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,760
And besides that, it was in 1980, so there was no internet, there was nothing,

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,880
and since I spoke very little English, I had no information.

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,500
I just had that name, so I came to Tokyo and then...

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:35,540
When I was in Lyon I had made
acquaintance with Japanese student and we had become friends,

51
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,720
so when I arrived, I called her and I said:

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,680
"You have to help me find this teacher, he does ju jutsu, we have to find him."

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,760
And so it was her who assisted me,

54
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,760
we visited almost all of the dojos in Tokyo,

55
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,080
and then finally we went to Omiya to a koryu dojo,

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,380
and the professor there told us:

57
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,560
“I know Shioda Sensei, his dojo is in Koganei. "

58
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,700
Then we looked in the phone book,

59
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,940
we called, and that's how I joined the dojo.

60
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,380
Considering the time, it was probably very different from today.

61
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,080
How was your arrival there?

62
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,480
It was quite chaotic.

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,340
I had very little financial means.

64
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,779
I had very little savings so I posted an ad.

65
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:49,039
I was at the University of Tokyo in the French literature department

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,260
and I put an ad in French:

67
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:58,420
"Young student would like to share accommodation with a Japanese".

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,200
I got an answer two days later I believe,

69
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,539
but it was quite far, in Saitama.

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,540
I shared the apartment with him.

71
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:17,440
Around 2:00 p.m., I took a two-hour journey by train,

72
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,920
I was going to Koganei and I was doing the beginner classes from 4 to 8 p.m.

73
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,759
So I was doing 3 hours and then I was going home at night.

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,900
After a month, my savings were gone,

75
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,160
and so on the last day i said goodbye to everyone.

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,400
I went to the dojo to say that I was really sorry, but that I had to leave because I had no more money.

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,430
By chance, in the parking lot,

78
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,380
there was the son of Shioda Gozo,

79
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,880
who intended to go to England to teach,

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,740
so he was looking for a foreigner to talk to in English,

81
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,080
so he was very excited to speak with a French person.

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,140
The two of us did not master the language well, but with a few words we could understand each other,

83
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,760
and so I explained my situation and he said to me:

84
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,080
"Well, today must be your lucky day because my father is here, so if
you want I can introduce you. "

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,970
I told him that I had come to Japan precisely to meet his father

86
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,980
but that after a month there, I had not even seen him,

87
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,020
so it would be a shame to have done this whole trip and leave without having seen him.

88
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:47,800
So he said to me, “OK, no problem” and he took me straight to Shioda Gozo's office, and he explained my situation to him.

89
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,140
After a while, Shioda, who was very small, stood up,

90
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,460
he looked at me right in the eyes and said:

91
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:02,060
"Is it true that you came on purpose to do
of Aikido and that you would like to stay? "

92
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
I told him of course, and he told me:

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,760
"OK, if you're courageous, if you can get up early in the morning, do all the chores"

94
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:22,960
"and in addition, if you can do 6 hours of lessons per day, then you are welcome to stay in the dojo, you have nothing to pay"

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,080
"or very little, just for amenities, water, electricity, stuff like that."

96
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:39,080
"If you're interested you can stay 3 months, and if I think you deserve it we'll see after that. "

97
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,520
I was amazed, I thanked him and said that I accepted immediately.

98
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,960
That's how all of a sudden, my life changed completely.

99
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,640
The next day I moved into the dojo.

100
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,640
This is something I heard from one of my teachers in Daito-ryu,

101
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,360
who trained  at the Yoshinkan for a while in the 1960s.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,760
When I asked him if he had taken a lot of lessons with Shioda Sensei, he said:

103
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,760
“No, he was too important already, we couldn't take lessons with him just like that. "

104
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Did he teach regularly, or were there private lessons?

105
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:36,560
My first entry into Yoshinkan was, I believe, October 1, 1981.

106
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,040
At that time, he was doing regular classes in the evening, I think it was Tuesday evening for an hour,

107
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,240
and Friday, or something like that.

108
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Otherwise he only did black belt courses, or special courses,

109
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,080
maybe twice a week,

110
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,320
and the rest of the classes were done by his instructors.

111
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,400
He just walked around.

112
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:15,470
For example, I did not take really ukemi for him until...

113
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,200
You had to be at least shodan, before that, you couldn't take ukemi for him.

114
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,080
He didn't speak to me at all for a year.

115
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,960
If he saw anything that I was doing wrong, he would go to the teachers and ask them to correct me.

116
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,800
There was no direct contact.

117
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,080
So I had to wait for when I became uchi deshi, when I took care of him.

118
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,560
I can't say that I could talk to him freely then, but there was some communication,

119
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
and I took ukemi for him.

120
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,640
There is debate, even in Japan, about the current meaning of the term uchi deshi.

121
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,280
In this case, there was a direct relationship, you were uchi deshi of Shioda Gozo,

122
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,000
not just a resident student at the Yoshinkan.

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
That's right.

124
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:19,760
I think I was lucky because I was included in this small uchi deshi group,

125
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,880
in the sense that a lot of training was done outside of the tatami.

126
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,720
So it was really still the traditional teaching.

127
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,780
What shocked me was that there was the corridor,

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,520
there was the office where all the instructors and deshi were,

129
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,080
there was Shioda Sensei's office next door,

130
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,700
and there were two doors, one here, and a one here.

131
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:05,240
And so the training was to feel when Shioda Sensei was going to come out of his office.

132
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,480
But since there were 2 doors, we didn't know from which one.

133
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,780
The training was to guess...

134
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,800
It depends, maybe we were chatting or drinking,

135
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,290
and immediately, with the sound of the door opening,

136
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:28,660
we knew immediately which door it was and we started to open the bathroom door, to present...

137
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,600
There was a sense of timing and not thinking,

138
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,540
that the body react automatically.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,600
And that was the teaching of uchi deshi.

140
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,740
There was all this non-verbal aspect that was there and that was becoming almost automatic.

141
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,040
And the body was moving on its own, practically.

142
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,660
It was not conscious but it brought me a lot.

143
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:10,320
After a while, it became an extraordinary asset that I used in the technique on the tatami.

144
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,360
Then, it's the same for the bath, for example.

145
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,300
It's really bathing, but it's so Japanese,

146
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,960
in the sense that there are no words,

147
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,420
it is communication by osmosis.

148
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,940
You have to be there at the right time.

149
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,620
You can't hesitate, you have to be there.

150
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,240
You have to learn from heart to heart, or body to heart, it's a truly unique teaching,

151
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,420
and I think that's what maybe is missing today.

152
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,540
Without it, I think my outlook on Aikido would have been completely different.

153
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,020
On this subject of the ishin-denshin relatiosbhip...

154
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,840
Right, that's what it is.

155
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,760
... or uchi deshi,

156
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,720
the last person I spoke to who experienced this, other than you,

157
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,520
it was in the completely different of rakugo [storytelling].

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,340
It was Katsura Sunshine, who lived with his master exactly in that way.

159
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:14,200
The question we asked ourselves is that indeed, if we want to learn an art thoroughly,

160
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,160
it's quite difficult in the Japanese system to do it differently from that,

161
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,260
and it is not accessible to everyone, necessarily, and by design.

162
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,760
Is this system it still continuing or is it in decline?

163
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,560
I personally think it's in decline.

164
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Because not too long ago I was at a sushi place,

165
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,580
and the guy told me that now, to open a sushi store,

166
00:14:50,580 --> 00:15:00,100
you just have to go and take lessons in a school for a year or two, and then you get a qualification.

167
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,120
And so it's no longer necessary to be an uchi deshi,

168
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,460
to clean for a year or two before you can touch the knife and do the thing...

169
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,440
Everything is done in a modern way.

170
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,060
I even see it in the Yoshinkan, the system no longer exists.

171
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,780
I don't know in other arts, how is it's going, but I think it is in decline.

172
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,800
And I also think that young Japanese people are not at all interested anymore.

173
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:48,940
I don't think they intend to spend 4 or 5 years just staring or cleaning,

174
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,040
they immediately want to take action and to learn.

175
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:01,280
I see. Without having been to such an extent of close long-term relationship with my own Daito-ryu teacher,

176
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,420
it is true that I can't see how certain things, certain teachings that I received, could have passed otherwise.

177
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,040
Right.

178
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,040
Without even being able to explain it, actually.

179
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,580
Exactly, right.

180
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,740
Because I remember things, for example, something mundane,

181
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:28,000
is that for example, Shioda called us to bring him a nail clipper.

182
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,840
So we brought him a nail clipper,

183
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,600
and then we looked, we waited for him to cut his nails, and then, as if by chance, he said to us:

184
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,560
“Here, what I have here, it's so hard that it's difficult for me to cut my nails. "

185
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,220
So it was a way for him to explain that this is where you have to put your balance...

186
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,920
Lean on...

187
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,320
Put on the weight on, lean on,

188
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,700
and so if we happened to have something elsewhere, that meant we did it wrong.

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,500
It is an indirect way of teaching

190
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
but if it hadn't been for that opportunity, I wouldn't have known that it was the important point,

191
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,840
because nobody would have said it.

192
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,440
So there are a lot of times like that where you have to be there right now,

193
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,020
otherwise, you won't know.

194
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,460
And the meaning does not necessarily reveal itself immediately...

195
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,020
That's right.

196
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,000
I imagine that you are thinking about things...

197
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,400
Yes, later: “There you go, that's what he meant there."

198
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:34,760
That I think is something I would like to pass on to my students but it is difficult.

199
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,600
And the system is dying little by little for lack of will

200
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,240
from the students to invest themselves in this type of long-term relationship,

201
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,280
and in particular if there are faster parallel ways, of course,

202
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,360
which we can see a lot anyway

203
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,600
- maybe less so in japan -

204
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,320
but in any case in the rest of the world,

205
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,660
a professionalization of aikido...

206
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,920
There you have it.

207
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,400
and so to be competitive, you have to do seminars, you have to get grades,

208
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,440
and who has time to spend 10 years, completely unknown, in the shadows?

209
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,140
Yes.

210
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,620
It's a shame but maybe it's the time that wants it.

211
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:29,720
How do you manage to overcome this pedagogical lack in your own teaching?

212
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,600
That's why I wanted to create a little more specialized classes,

213
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,100
and therefore I set up the kenshusei,

214
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,900
with the condition of living in community.

215
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:51,680
We have a house and the kenshusei are forced to stay for a year

216
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,600
and live together.

217
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:03,480
So it's not a hotel, they have to really take care of it like it's a dojo.

218
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,660
And besides, I try to keep

219
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,529
- well it doesn't go as far as an uchi deshi -

220
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,860
but I still try to keep what was important to me,

221
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,860
respect, attitude,

222
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,900
towards seniors.

223
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,480
To surpass oneself, of course physically, but also mentally.

224
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,700
I try to do the whole lot, but it gets harder and harder,

225
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:46,040
because for young people today, It's difficult, they can't stand it.

226
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,220
I think 2 years ago, 2 young people in their twenties,

227
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,620
they didn't last a week, after a week ...

228
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,820
They were mostly in shock...

229
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,460
They'd never seen that so...

230
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,000
There is certainly an image problem with this,

231
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,340
because I regularly receive emails asking me:

232
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,400
"I really want to become an uchi deshi, where can I be an uchi deshi?"

233
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,860
And I responde: "Do you understand what it is?"

234
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,380
Right.

235
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,480
"Are you ready to give up everything, without really any resources."

236
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Right.

237
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,400
Because it's an almost total sacrifice,

238
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,120
it's practically becoming someone's slave.

239
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
That's it, and without guarantees...

240
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,120
And without guarantees.

241
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,760
It's not like a university degree where it ensures you an income afterwards...

242
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,840
Right, there is really no guarantees.

243
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,840
To get back to the uchi deshi group of the time,

244
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,040
how many people are we talking about,

245
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,560
and were there already foreigners?

246
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:58,400
Yes when I arrived there was a Frenchman, Muguruza Jacques, who also stayed for five years

247
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:06,080
and I believe that before him there was someone from New Zealand who stayed for a year.

248
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,000
And before that I think there was a Korean.

249
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,160
But that's about all.

250
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:23,080
Muguruza left after a year and so I was alone, I was the only foreigner.

251
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,320
OK.

252
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,520
And de facto, once you enter the uchi deshi system,

253
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,480
after a certain period of time are you given teaching responsibilities in the structure?

254
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,970
Yes, because when I got here

255
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,440
so I started at 1980...

256
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,800
in 1981, i became uchi deshi,

257
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,520
and therefore in 1982 -83,

258
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,560
as there were starting to be more foreigners coming to Japan to train at the dojo,

259
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,760
they gave me the...

260
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,440
- I think it's also because they didn't want to... it was easier for me to take care of... -

261
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,160
So my role was to teach beginners and especially foreigners

262
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,320
and after a while,

263
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
it was foreigners and Japanese at the same time,

264
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,800
so I took care of beginners like that.

265
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:23,520
So I was an assistant instructor and then later I became an instructor.

266
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:33,480
But I imagine there are also other systems of instructors in place, outside of the
uchi deshi program itself?

267
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,200
When I was in Yoshinkan, no, you had to be uchi deshi.

268
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,000
It was done internally.

269
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,200
There were no people from outside who could become uchi deshi.

270
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,240
An obvious difference compared to the functioning of the Aikikai, which I know a little better,

271
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,080
is that there have been foreigners in the teaching staff of the Yoshinkan for a lone time.

272
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,400
Yes.

273
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,680
And it's still not the case at the Aikikai.

274
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:15,360
Do you know how it came to be and what was the idea behind it?

275
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,480
I think it all comes from the relationship with Shioda Sensei.

276
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,520
I think Shioda Sensei...

277
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:37,480
I don't remember his name, but there was an Englishman who was a student in the 1950s, at the beginning.

278
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,280
And he was very close to Shioda Sensei,

279
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,840
and since he was well off, I believe when he returned to England he gave him his house.

280
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,320
So the house where Shioda Sensei lived until his death,

281
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,080
belonged to one of his students, he gave it to him, it was like that,

282
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,040
because he respected him, and Shioda, I think that it influenced him a lot.

283
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,720
Since that, there has always been a good relationship,

284
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
he was very open-minded.

285
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,840
The uchi deshi who were there, whether it was the New Zealander or the Frenchman Jacques Muguruza,

286
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,400
they really loved aikido, they had done their best, so i think he had some respect for that.

287
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
So he was open that's why, I think.

288
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
That's what made the difference I guess.

289
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,120
Once these uchi deshi got home, what happened?

290
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,800
Was there still some kind of continuous contact with the Yoshinkan?

291
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm thinking for example of the term of curriculum or exam criteria,

292
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,600
things like that, or did everyone do their own thing?

293
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
No, it was still ...

294
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,800
- it's a little different since they created the Yoshinkan International there, -

295
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,520
but before it was only a direct line, it was Shioda Sensei, there was only one curriculum,

296
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,720
and all the deshi followed that to the letter.

297
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,400
So initially there were very few branches, really.

298
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
The first one was one of the oldest uchi deshi, Kushida Sensei,

299
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,120
in 1973, I believe, he went to Michigan in the United States,

300
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,200
and it is he who really developed the Yoshinkan in the United States.

301
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,480
And so there was the shibucho,

302
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,360
and it is the shibucho that recommended the students directly to Japan,

303
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,840
so there was a system of trust.

304
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:59,040
They really followed the Hombu curriculum, until almost 1990,

305
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,240
where they setup the International Yoshinkan Federation.

306
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:14,480
From that time, everyone did a little bit as they wanted,

307
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
so we lost a bit of this very strong relationship between the Hombu and the foreigners.
