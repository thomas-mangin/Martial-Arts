00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:10,759

 

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,829

okay so it's very

4
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:12,839
okay so it's very
 

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,430
okay so it's very
important I'm going to introduce a drill

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
important I'm going to introduce a drill
 

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,230
important I'm going to introduce a drill
you're going to Asser it that's just

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
you're going to Asser it that's just
 

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,590
you're going to Asser it that's just
what happens then I take out whatever

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
what happens then I take out whatever
 

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,509
what happens then I take out whatever
part you did not assert and I work from

12
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
part you did not assert and I work from
 

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,830
part you did not assert and I work from
there okay that's that's the upic way so

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
there okay that's that's the upic way so
 

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,430
there okay that's that's the upic way so
for example those people uh work in the

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:32,440
for example those people uh work in the
 

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,110
for example those people uh work in the
cooku set it's fine as I said

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
cooku set it's fine as I said
 

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,350
cooku set it's fine as I said
externally that you are bracing and

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,360
externally that you are bracing and
 

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,709
externally that you are bracing and
pushing on the center okay that's all we

22
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
pushing on the center okay that's all we
 

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,270
pushing on the center okay that's all we
got but we can work from there doesn't

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
got but we can work from there doesn't
 

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,790
got but we can work from there doesn't
mean it's right so as you keep working

26
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:47,800
mean it's right so as you keep working
 

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,750
mean it's right so as you keep working
the drill you have to keep refining the

28
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
the drill you have to keep refining the
 

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,549
the drill you have to keep refining the
drill concentrate on the pointers I gave

30
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
drill concentrate on the pointers I gave
 

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,229
drill concentrate on the pointers I gave
you so for example it's not that they

32
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,239
you so for example it's not that they
 

33
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,349
you so for example it's not that they
get displaced it is how you displace

34
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:58,359
get displaced it is how you displace
 

35
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,950
get displaced it is how you displace
them so don't measure your success

36
00:00:59,950 --> 00:00:59,960
them so don't measure your success
 

37
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,189
them so don't measure your success
assessed by whether they moved or not or

38
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
assessed by whether they moved or not or
 

39
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,070
assessed by whether they moved or not or
when I go ahead and say you know what

40
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,080
when I go ahead and say you know what
 

41
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,950
when I go ahead and say you know what
really just focus in on drill one and

42
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:07,960
really just focus in on drill one and
 

43
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,030
really just focus in on drill one and
release while maintaining positional

44
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,040
release while maintaining positional
 

45
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,550
release while maintaining positional
integrity that's going to get you

46
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,560
integrity that's going to get you
 

47
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,030
integrity that's going to get you
further than if you're just displacing

48
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
further than if you're just displacing
 

49
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,749
further than if you're just displacing
them externally or as I tell you at a

50
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:16,759
them externally or as I tell you at a
 

51
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,830
them externally or as I tell you at a
certain point don't do the other drills

52
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
certain point don't do the other drills
 

53
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,910
certain point don't do the other drills
do the last drill where you don't have

54
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:20,920
do the last drill where you don't have
 

55
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,350
do the last drill where you don't have
the bracing angle okay and you that's me

56
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
the bracing angle okay and you that's me
 

57
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,270
the bracing angle okay and you that's me
working from where you're

58
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
working from where you're
 

59
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,749
working from where you're
at so in this next drill that we use and

60
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
at so in this next drill that we use and
 

61
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,630
at so in this next drill that we use and
uh for example Ivan I think you ought to

62
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:33,640
uh for example Ivan I think you ought to
 

63
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,870
uh for example Ivan I think you ought to
start heading here continue to work with

64
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880
start heading here continue to work with
 

65
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,510
start heading here continue to work with
your feet together uh when you work the

66
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
your feet together uh when you work the
 

67
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,550
your feet together uh when you work the
C you set and then play with this drill

68
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,560
C you set and then play with this drill
 

69
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,510
C you set and then play with this drill
okay uh and so the takeaway here is that

70
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:46,520
okay uh and so the takeaway here is that
 

71
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,990
okay uh and so the takeaway here is that
the coke you set is the beginner drill

72
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,000
the coke you set is the beginner drill
 

73
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,230
the coke you set is the beginner drill
just to get you in the ballp part it's

74
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,240
just to get you in the ballp part it's
 

75
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,830
just to get you in the ballp part it's
not the end all drill okay this this is

76
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:54,840
not the end all drill okay this this is
 

77
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,670
not the end all drill okay this this is
now going to start working on things

78
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
now going to start working on things
 

79
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,310
now going to start working on things
that they're kind of in the coke you

80
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
that they're kind of in the coke you
 

81
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,550
that they're kind of in the coke you
drill set but not overtly this is

82
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
drill set but not overtly this is
 

83
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,230
drill set but not overtly this is
overtly okay and you probably aren't

84
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,240
overtly okay and you probably aren't
 

85
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,029
overtly okay and you probably aren't
ready for this because you probably

86
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:07,039
ready for this because you probably
 

87
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,630
ready for this because you probably
assured the cooku drill set and this

88
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
assured the cooku drill set and this
 

89
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,229
assured the cooku drill set and this
will help refine that uration okay so in

90
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
will help refine that uration okay so in
 

91
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,509
will help refine that uration okay so in
this game he pushes at me and I and I

92
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
this game he pushes at me and I and I
 

93
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,790
this game he pushes at me and I and I
project okay that's you've seen us do

94
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
project okay that's you've seen us do
 

95
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,630
project okay that's you've seen us do
this several times we don't worry about

96
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:21,640
this several times we don't worry about
 

97
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,270
this several times we don't worry about
the throw we just work on the projection

98
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
the throw we just work on the projection
 

99
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,470
the throw we just work on the projection
part okay so what happens is as we have

100
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
part okay so what happens is as we have
 

101
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,750
part okay so what happens is as we have
here we have some people

102
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
here we have some people
 

103
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,750
here we have some people
that can do the CQ drill set and then

104
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
that can do the CQ drill set and then
 

105
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,430
that can do the CQ drill set and then
when they get to

106
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
when they get to
 

107
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,350
when they get to
this they can't do this drill so there's

108
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
this they can't do this drill so there's
 

109
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,910
this they can't do this drill so there's
two ways that this tends to manifest the

110
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
two ways that this tends to manifest the
 

111
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,670
two ways that this tends to manifest the
incorrect way which I'll demonstrate now

112
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:44,680
incorrect way which I'll demonstrate now
 

113
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,390
incorrect way which I'll demonstrate now
and what we want out of it the correct

114
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,400
and what we want out of it the correct
 

115
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,949
and what we want out of it the correct
way so the incorrect way is you move out

116
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
way so the incorrect way is you move out
 

117
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,750
way so the incorrect way is you move out
of the way and then you push

118
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
of the way and then you push
 

119
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,589
of the way and then you push
that with any number of ways that you do

120
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
that with any number of ways that you do
 

121
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,190
that with any number of ways that you do
that

122
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
that
 

123
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,030
that
okay that's not going to help us because

124
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
okay that's not going to help us because
 

125
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,630
okay that's not going to help us because
that that could happen in altercation or

126
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
that that could happen in altercation or
 

127
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,229
that that could happen in altercation or
it could happen uh but it's not what we

128
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
it could happen uh but it's not what we
 

129
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,869
it could happen uh but it's not what we
try to do so for example in K Anda

130
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
try to do so for example in K Anda
 

131
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,750
try to do so for example in K Anda
that's not correct we don't do that in

132
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,760
that's not correct we don't do that in
 

133
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,550
that's not correct we don't do that in
KIU Anda okay what we do instead is we

134
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,560
KIU Anda okay what we do instead is we
 

135
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,350
KIU Anda okay what we do instead is we
deviate in a way to load the arm that he

136
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
deviate in a way to load the arm that he
 

137
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,070
deviate in a way to load the arm that he
ends up bouncing off of okay so I'll

138
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,080
ends up bouncing off of okay so I'll
 

139
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,350
ends up bouncing off of okay so I'll
work with this right hand here I am

140
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
work with this right hand here I am
 

141
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,509
work with this right hand here I am
doing the incorrect way I get out of the

142
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
doing the incorrect way I get out of the
 

143
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,789
doing the incorrect way I get out of the
way and then I push it it doesn't matter

144
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
way and then I push it it doesn't matter
 

145
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,229
way and then I push it it doesn't matter
whether your hands are not uh going out

146
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:41,239
whether your hands are not uh going out
 

147
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,470
whether your hands are not uh going out
so for example don't get focused on this

148
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
so for example don't get focused on this
 

149
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,309
so for example don't get focused on this
version my hands going out this version

150
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
version my hands going out this version
 

151
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,110
version my hands going out this version
is also wrong my hands don't go out and

152
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
is also wrong my hands don't go out and
 

153
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,229
is also wrong my hands don't go out and
that version is also wrong because the

154
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
that version is also wrong because the
 

155
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,229
that version is also wrong because the
energy is not being internalized and

156
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
energy is not being internalized and
 

157
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,270
energy is not being internalized and
increasingly uh G generating the CQ that

158
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
increasingly uh G generating the CQ that
 

159
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,750
increasingly uh G generating the CQ that
I'm going to project with okay so it

160
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm going to project with okay so it
 

161
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,350
I'm going to project with okay so it
doesn't really matter what my hands are

162
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,360
doesn't really matter what my hands are
 

163
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,229
doesn't really matter what my hands are
doing it matters what I'm doing in my

164
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
doing it matters what I'm doing in my
 

165
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,789
doing it matters what I'm doing in my
deviation again doesn't matter on the

166
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:13,799
deviation again doesn't matter on the
 

167
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,110
deviation again doesn't matter on the
handshake but him coming in is loading

168
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,120
handshake but him coming in is loading
 

169
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,949
handshake but him coming in is loading
what gets deflected okay so we're going

170
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
what gets deflected okay so we're going
 

171
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,790
what gets deflected okay so we're going
to work on that and I'll film them as

172
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
to work on that and I'll film them as
 

173
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,390
to work on that and I'll film them as
they're working on it you'll see who's

174
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
they're working on it you'll see who's
 

175
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,950
they're working on it you'll see who's
able to do it who's not they get to see

176
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
able to do it who's not they get to see
 

177
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,870
able to do it who's not they get to see
themselves on video but that is what

178
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
themselves on video but that is what
 

179
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,310
themselves on video but that is what
you're trying to do in this this drill

180
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
you're trying to do in this this drill
 

181
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,710
you're trying to do in this this drill
load the cou hand with their assault not

182
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
load the cou hand with their assault not
 

183
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:51,110
load the cou hand with their assault not
get out of the way and then attack okay

184
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120

 

185
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,270

he keep going I'll tell you when this

186
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
he keep going I'll tell you when this
 

187
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:05,150
he keep going I'll tell you when this
stop

188
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160

 

189
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,590

you're going to keep going I'm going to

190
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
you're going to keep going I'm going to
 

191
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,310
you're going to keep going I'm going to
talk okay out of the way

192
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,320

 

193
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,670

push out of the way

194
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:16,680

 

195
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,790

push out of the way a little

196
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:21,800

 

197
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,469

better out of the way a little better

198
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
better out of the way a little better
 

199
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,029
better out of the way a little better
there we

200
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,039

 

201
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,029

go better okay what did you have to do

202
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:32,039
go better okay what did you have to do
 

203
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,629
go better okay what did you have to do
differently let more pressure build up

204
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
differently let more pressure build up
 

205
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,990
differently let more pressure build up
yes let more pressure build up so pay

206
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
yes let more pressure build up so pay
 

207
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,270
yes let more pressure build up so pay
attention to your angle deviation okay

208
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,280
attention to your angle deviation okay
 

209
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,550
attention to your angle deviation okay
in regards to I need to let more

210
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
in regards to I need to let more
 

211
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,230
in regards to I need to let more
pressure build up so do the first way

212
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
pressure build up so do the first way
 

213
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,550
pressure build up so do the first way
and watch your angle of deviation and

214
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
and watch your angle of deviation and
 

215
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,189
and watch your angle of deviation and
note what it is the first wrong

216
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199

 

217
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,110

way okay do it again same side because

218
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,120
way okay do it again same side because
 

219
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,270
way okay do it again same side because
you're going to describe to me what

220
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
you're going to describe to me what
 

221
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:11,790
you're going to describe to me what
you're doing doing terms of geometry

222
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:11,800

 

223
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,510

he okay what are you

224
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
he okay what are you
 

225
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,309
he okay what are you
doing I'm deviating yeah you're getting

226
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:17,319
doing I'm deviating yeah you're getting
 

227
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,749
doing I'm deviating yeah you're getting
out of the way I know that that's why

228
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:18,759
out of the way I know that that's why
 

229
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,749
out of the way I know that that's why
it's called angle

230
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:20,759
it's called angle
 

231
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,830
it's called angle
deviation um I'm just basically getting

232
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
deviation um I'm just basically getting
 

233
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,189
deviation um I'm just basically getting
to a point where I feel zero

234
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
to a point where I feel zero
 

235
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,110
to a point where I feel zero
pressure um I think I'm deviating

236
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
pressure um I think I'm deviating
 

237
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,909
pressure um I think I'm deviating
90° let's watch and let's just just see

238
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
90° let's watch and let's just just see
 

239
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:51,790
90° let's watch and let's just just see
if that's true same

240
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:51,800

 

241
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,469

thing what else can you tell me it's not

242
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:55,479
thing what else can you tell me it's not
 

243
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,830
thing what else can you tell me it's not
90° no it isn't it's um it's kind of in

244
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
90° no it isn't it's um it's kind of in
 

245

7:30 do you understand okay what what is
 

255
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,350
7:30 do you understand okay what what is
happening you said zero pressure okay so

256
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
happening you said zero pressure okay so
 

257
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,909
happening you said zero pressure okay so
I'm moving ahead of him let's check for

258
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
I'm moving ahead of him let's check for
 

259
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm moving ahead of him let's check for
zero pressure so we know it wasn't 90 de

260
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
zero pressure so we know it wasn't 90 de
 

261
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,869
zero pressure so we know it wasn't 90 de
and you're going to check for zero

262
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:28,879
and you're going to check for zero
 

263
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:43,070
and you're going to check for zero
pressure

264
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,080

 

265
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,510

he so zero pressure is a phrase I use

266
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520
he so zero pressure is a phrase I use
 

267
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,629
he so zero pressure is a phrase I use
okay you're going to get a t-shirt

268

slogan you're going to start using my
 

271
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,189
slogan you're going to start using my
phrase but you don't have the same

272
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:52,199
phrase but you don't have the same
 

273
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,830
phrase but you don't have the same
definition okay so zero pressure is

274
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
definition okay so zero pressure is
 

275
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,309
definition okay so zero pressure is
what zero pressure is when You'

276
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
what zero pressure is when You'
 

277
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,589
what zero pressure is when You'
when you're not pushing or

couple

304
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
couple
 

305
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,630

things there's one more thing but I

306
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:47,640
things there's one more thing but I
 

307
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,470
things there's one more thing but I
don't think you'll ever get it which

308
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,480
don't think you'll ever get it which
 

309
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,790
don't think you'll ever get it which
it's related to zero pressure so when

310
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
it's related to zero pressure so when
 

311
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,310
it's related to zero pressure so when
you move to the

312
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
you move to the
 

313
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,509
you move to the
angle you let him by that's say it's not

314
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:58,519
angle you let him by that's say it's not
 

315
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,990
angle you let him by that's say it's not
zero pressure

316
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
zero pressure
 

317
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,190
zero pressure
you see pay

318
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,200
you see pay
 

319
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,750
you see pay
attention here Z pressure is here you

320
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,760
attention here Z pressure is here you
 

321
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,230
attention here Z pressure is here you
see you go here you're now negative and

322
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
see you go here you're now negative and
 

323
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,590
see you go here you're now negative and
that's why you can push okay so if we

324
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,600
that's why you can push okay so if we
 

325
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,350
that's why you can push okay so if we
look at the third thing that I want you

326
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,360
look at the third thing that I want you
 

327
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,269
look at the third thing that I want you
to

328
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
to
 

329
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,630
to
notice is his Center gravity and the

330
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,640
notice is his Center gravity and the
 

331
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,110
notice is his Center gravity and the
majority of his

332
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
majority of his
 

333
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,750
majority of his
weight passes your projection point you

334
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
weight passes your projection point you
 

335
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,949
weight passes your projection point you
see that and that's why you have to go

336
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
see that and that's why you have to go
 

337
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,069
see that and that's why you have to go
positive

338
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:32,079

 

339
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,670

at this point in the video I'll put the

340
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
at this point in the video I'll put the
 

341
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,350
at this point in the video I'll put the
corrections that you did okay but you're

342
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
corrections that you did okay but you're
 

343
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,069
corrections that you did okay but you're
going to see that you didn't let his

344
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
going to see that you didn't let his
 

345
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,949
going to see that you didn't let his
Center gravity pass the projection

346
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:43,959
Center gravity pass the projection
 

347
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,230
Center gravity pass the projection
point you took enough deviation to get

348
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,240
point you took enough deviation to get
 

349
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,069
point you took enough deviation to get
it and you hit it at a at an angle do

350
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:51,079
it and you hit it at a at an angle do
 

351
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,550
it and you hit it at a at an angle do
you see that of course you could go

352
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
you see that of course you could go
 

353
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,590
you see that of course you could go
straight back in but we want that spiral

354
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
straight back in but we want that spiral
 

355
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,670
straight back in but we want that spiral
rotation and that's where I project

356
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
rotation and that's where I project
 

357
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,949
rotation and that's where I project
there not let you go past cuz now I'm

358
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:05,959
there not let you go past cuz now I'm
 

359
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,910
there not let you go past cuz now I'm
doing the second thing you see that so

360
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
doing the second thing you see that so
 

361
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,310
doing the second thing you see that so
in your phrase when you said let more

362
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,320
in your phrase when you said let more
 

363
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,990
in your phrase when you said let more
pressure yeah okay when you let it go

364
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
pressure yeah okay when you let it go
 

365
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,750
pressure yeah okay when you let it go
past you you don't have pressure loading

366
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
past you you don't have pressure loading
 

367
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,269
past you you don't have pressure loading
it

368
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
it
 

369
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,389
it
anymore so I let pressure build that's

370
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
anymore so I let pressure build that's
 

371
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,710
anymore so I let pressure build that's
where I

372
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
where I
 

373
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,550
where I
hit

374
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:27,560
hit
 

375
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,509
hit
so now let's say

376
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:30,519
so now let's say
 

377
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,630
so now let's say
I can't

378
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:31,640
I can't
 

379
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,949
I can't
basee do you understand whoa he's

380
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
basee do you understand whoa he's
 

381
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,790
basee do you understand whoa he's
starting to push me that's not going to

382
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:37,800
starting to push me that's not going to
 

383
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,670
starting to push me that's not going to
make this

384
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680

 

385
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,590

right maybe so for maybe for example on

386
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
right maybe so for maybe for example on
 

387
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,590
right maybe so for maybe for example on
me you know I can I can do this all on

388
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
me you know I can I can do this all on
 

389
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,750
me you know I can I can do this all on
one leg so I that's all I need to get

390
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
one leg so I that's all I need to get
 

391
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,389
one leg so I that's all I need to get
this power rotation that'll work to load

392
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
this power rotation that'll work to load
 

393
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,190
this power rotation that'll work to load
you so let's look at the angle you're

394
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
you so let's look at the angle you're
 

395
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,310
you so let's look at the angle you're
coming this way I just need a kind of

396
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
coming this way I just need a kind of
 

397
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,870
coming this way I just need a kind of
shearing angle

398
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
shearing angle
 

399
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,470
shearing angle
that's it that's enough but

400
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,480
that's it that's enough but
 

401
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,069
that's it that's enough but
maybe you when you take that same angle

402
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
maybe you when you take that same angle
 

403
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,829
maybe you when you take that same angle
because you can't ground maybe you start

404
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:08,839
because you can't ground maybe you start
 

405
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:09,870
because you can't ground maybe you start
to feel

406
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:09,880
to feel
 

407
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,949
to feel
compromised you have some options here

408
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
compromised you have some options here
 

409
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,190
compromised you have some options here
you can change your Tachi so I'll go to

410
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
you can change your Tachi so I'll go to
 

411
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,389
you can change your Tachi so I'll go to
that same shooting angle it's starting

412
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
that same shooting angle it's starting
 

413
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,069
that same shooting angle it's starting
to overpower me I turn

414
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:21,079
to overpower me I turn
 

415
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,150
to overpower me I turn
it you see that so I keep the same

416
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
it you see that so I keep the same
 

417
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,790
it you see that so I keep the same
shearing angle boom and there'll be less

418
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:27,800
shearing angle boom and there'll be less
 

419
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,629
shearing angle boom and there'll be less
pressure coming into me because I did

420
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:29,639
pressure coming into me because I did
 

421
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,030
pressure coming into me because I did
the tesak or I can keep the same Tachi

422
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
the tesak or I can keep the same Tachi
 

423
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,190
the tesak or I can keep the same Tachi
but instead of being as sharp as I am

424
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
but instead of being as sharp as I am
 

425
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,829
but instead of being as sharp as I am
here I just take a little off but I

426
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
here I just take a little off but I
 

427
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,509
here I just take a little off but I
don't let your Center pass me do you

428
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:42,519
don't let your Center pass me do you
 

429
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,430
don't let your Center pass me do you
guys see that and then of course you

430
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
guys see that and then of course you
 

431
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,949
guys see that and then of course you
can't combine the two so I'm over here I

432
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
can't combine the two so I'm over here I
 

433
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,030
can't combine the two so I'm over here I
get that whoa I feel I'm going to lose

434
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
get that whoa I feel I'm going to lose
 

435
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,750
get that whoa I feel I'm going to lose
it so I do K aaki you see but I don't

436
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:54,760
it so I do K aaki you see but I don't
 

437
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,949
it so I do K aaki you see but I don't
want you to pass

438
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
want you to pass
 

439
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,269
want you to pass
me I feel overpowered here again then I

440
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:00,279
me I feel overpowered here again then I
 

441
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,350
me I feel overpowered here again then I
take the

442
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
take the
 

443
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,590
take the
step you guys see that but you can't let

444
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,600
step you guys see that but you can't let
 

445
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,110
step you guys see that but you can't let
this Center go by you entirely he go it

446
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120
this Center go by you entirely he go it
 

447
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,470
this Center go by you entirely he go it
goes by me because I project I project

448
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,480
goes by me because I project I project
 

449
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,110
goes by me because I project I project
it off at that angle got it in this case

450
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
it off at that angle got it in this case
 

451
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,470
it off at that angle got it in this case
I'm T taking you back to 10 and two and

452
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm T taking you back to 10 and two and
 

453
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm T taking you back to 10 and two and
that's where I want you to work now

454
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:20,920
that's where I want you to work now
 

455
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,269
that's where I want you to work now
you're 10 and two you're not going to

456
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
you're 10 and two you're not going to
 

457
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,150
you're 10 and two you're not going to
make this mistake of getting out of the

458
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,160
make this mistake of getting out of the
 

459
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,829
make this mistake of getting out of the
way and not loading okay so for now work

460
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
way and not loading okay so for now work
 

461
00:12:29,839 --> 00:13:06,120
way and not loading okay so for now work
T in two okay here we go

462
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,130

465
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,750

okay so that one where she got kind of

466
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
okay so that one where she got kind of
 

467
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,269
okay so that one where she got kind of
jacked up that that one was telling in

468
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
jacked up that that one was telling in
 

469
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,629
jacked up that that one was telling in
the gross fashion but the the errors

470
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
the gross fashion but the the errors
 

471
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,550
the gross fashion but the the errors
that led to that one they're in all of

now you're making the mistake from the
last

680
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
last
 

681

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,230
center stay in the
center stay in the center you don't have

686
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,240
center stay in the center you don't have
 

687
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,750
center stay in the center you don't have
to you don't need the 180 line on there

688
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
to you don't need the 180 line on there
 

689
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,029
to you don't need the 180 line on there
so you can't advance that way okay so in

690
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
so you can't advance that way okay so in
 

691
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,190
so you can't advance that way okay so in
the last video what I said is from here

692
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
the last video what I said is from here
 

693
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,590
the last video what I said is from here
where wherever she's touching me her

709
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,230

go down you see that there there I'm I'm

710
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
go down you see that there there I'm I'm
 

711
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,870
go down you see that there there I'm I'm
taking the pressure and I'm making it go

712
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:25,880
taking the pressure and I'm making it go
 

713
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,950
taking the pressure and I'm making it go
down and as I do that I feel that she's

714
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
down and as I do that I feel that she's
 

715
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,270
down and as I do that I feel that she's
rolling forward on me so I have to

716
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
rolling forward on me so I have to
 

717
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,669
rolling forward on me so I have to
change it and I start to spill over the

718
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
change it and I start to spill over the
 

719
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,630
change it and I start to spill over the
top if she drops the elbow it starts to

720
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
top if she drops the elbow it starts to
 

721
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,590
top if she drops the elbow it starts to
come off so I start to turn it do you

722
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
come off so I start to turn it do you
 

723
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,430
come off so I start to turn it do you
see and then you got her so all this is

724
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
see and then you got her so all this is
 

725
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,029
see and then you got her so all this is
on the Fly you feel what she's doing you

726
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
on the Fly you feel what she's doing you
 

727
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,070
on the Fly you feel what she's doing you
want to be in the center I got to get in

728
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
want to be in the center I got to get in
 

729
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,950
want to be in the center I got to get in
the center so if I go down there's

730
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:51,960
the center so if I go down there's
 

731
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,029
the center so if I go down there's
nothing there so I have to work this

732
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:56,039
nothing there so I have to work this
 

733
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,430
nothing there so I have to work this
whole thing motion see how I came back a

734

little to bring more weight onto it

736
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:01,640
little to bring more weight onto it
 

737
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,630

that'll change the angle that I need

738
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
that'll change the angle that I need

pressure that you

794
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
pressure that you
 

795

you'll feel that pressure that's where
 

801
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,070
you'll feel that pressure that's where
you should have just stayed where you

802

again but that's telling you the
 

841
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,430
again but that's telling you the
pressure was in him how did you reabsorb

842
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
pressure was in him how did you reabsorb
 

843
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,430

that I was already running that way do

894
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,240
that I was already running that way do
 

895
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,149

you understand I just hear and you

896
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:45,159

 

897
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:58,870

go now he gets on his feedback

898
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880

 

899
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,269

now he feels like he got it but I did

900
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:02,279
now he feels like he got it but I did
 

901
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,669
now he feels like he got it but I did
not be a

902
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
not be a
 

903
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,909
not be a
good he's not really seeing what's

904
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
good he's not really seeing what's
 

905
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,669
good he's not really seeing what's
happening okay try it again so if we go

906
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
happening okay try it again so if we go
 

907
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,510
happening okay try it again so if we go
to a Kean it's going to be the same he's

908
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,520
to a Kean it's going to be the same he's
 

909
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,230
to a Kean it's going to be the same he's
driving I take enough deviation that I

910
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
driving I take enough deviation that I
 

911
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,230
driving I take enough deviation that I
can load that

912
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240

difference now because I'm not just

916
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
difference now because I'm not just
 

917
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,590
difference now because I'm not just
trying to move him in the sagittal plane

918
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
trying to move him in the sagittal plane
 

919
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,950
trying to move him in the sagittal plane
I'm trying to generate that front inward

920
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:29,960
I'm trying to generate that front inward
 

921
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,310
I'm trying to generate that front inward
kazushi okay so as I get into the center

922
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,320
kazushi okay so as I get into the center
 

923
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,870
kazushi okay so as I get into the center
I hit there and as he starts to bounce

924
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:37,880
I hit there and as he starts to bounce
 

925
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,630
I hit there and as he starts to bounce
off that's when I turn back into the arm

926
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
off that's when I turn back into the arm
 

927
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,750
off that's when I turn back into the arm
cuz that's when the arm becomes

928
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:42,760
cuz that's when the arm becomes
 

929
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,029
cuz that's when the arm becomes
isolated you don't want to come into the

930
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:46,039
isolated you don't want to come into the
 

931
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,789
isolated you don't want to come into the
arm at the

932
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:47,799
arm at the
 

933
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,630
arm at the
start he he hits boom Center you get it

934
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
start he he hits boom Center you get it
 

935
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,470
start he he hits boom Center you get it
then you continue this the spiral don't

936
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
then you continue this the spiral don't
 

937
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,190
then you continue this the spiral don't
go negative

938
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
go negative
 

939
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,990
go negative
and then attempt to push that that is

940
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
and then attempt to push that that is
 

941
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,190
and then attempt to push that that is
something different got it you know what

942
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
something different got it you know what
 

943
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,110
something different got it you know what
causes that what you let him go

944
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,120
causes that what you let him go
 

945
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:17,549
causes that what you let him go
completely by you and then you

946
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:17,559

 

947
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,430

push and to me the first EDD me is the

948
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,440
push and to me the first EDD me is the
 

949
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,110

end of the technique because after that

950
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
end of the technique because after that
 

951
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,830
end of the technique because after that
requires a what if what if he keeps

952
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
requires a what if what if he keeps
 

953
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,870
requires a what if what if he keeps
pushing on the arm well then I come

954
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:29,880
pushing on the arm well then I come
 

955
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,990
pushing on the arm well then I come
around I keep attacking the arm okay so

956
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
around I keep attacking the arm okay so
 

957
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,350
