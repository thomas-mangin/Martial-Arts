00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,070

there's there's pieces you can add

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
there's there's pieces you can add
 

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,470
there's there's pieces you can add
if you offer them it here

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
if you offer them it here
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,750

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:11,340
you're doing the wrong technique
 

9
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,850
you're doing the wrong technique
because it's natural if it's coming like

10
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:13,860
because it's natural if it's coming like
 

11
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,950
because it's natural if it's coming like
that it's downwards isn't it it's

12
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
that it's downwards isn't it it's
 

13
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,189
that it's downwards isn't it it's
downwards if he's coming here

14
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
downwards if he's coming here
 

15
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,269
downwards if he's coming here
then you've got a chance to all right so

16
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
then you've got a chance to all right so
 

17
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,330
then you've got a chance to all right so
what I found is

18
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,340
what I found is
 

19
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,910
what I found is
I'm so busy here that I get a little bit

20
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm so busy here that I get a little bit

this big lump through here so I'm not
 

25
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,250
this big lump through here so I'm not
very elegant of that so I need a little

26
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,260
very elegant of that so I need a little
 

27
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,310
very elegant of that so I need a little
more space so this is for the for the

28
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
more space so this is for the for the
 

29
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,069

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,049
push him to the stage without him
knowing it

34
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:48,059

 

35
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,810

to give it a bit more spice

36
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:50,820
to give it a bit more spice
 

37
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,950
to give it a bit more spice
it

38
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
it
 

39
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,170
it
it's not so much pushing him as it's

40
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,180
it's not so much pushing him as it's
 

41
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,990
it's not so much pushing him as it's
holding him off for from cat for this

42
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
holding him off for from cat for this
 

43
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,950
holding him off for from cat for this

47
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,329
so I go like that
and that's how I actually put a little

48
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:05,339
and that's how I actually put a little
 

49
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,789
and that's how I actually put a little
bit of that into it I'm not trying to
