1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,150

um so when he pushes into me

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
um so when he pushes into me
 

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,309
um so when he pushes into me
you'll see there's some sort of

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
you'll see there's some sort of
 

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,909
you'll see there's some sort of
absorption that happens

6
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
absorption that happens
 

7
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,950
absorption that happens
okay so you you can

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
okay so you you can
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,110
okay so you you can
i go this way you see

10
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120

 

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,150

contrast is no absorption i'm like a a

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
contrast is no absorption i'm like a a
 

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,029
contrast is no absorption i'm like a a
brick wall

14
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
brick wall
 

15
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,189
brick wall
do you see that okay that absorption

16
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
do you see that okay that absorption
 

17
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,830
do you see that okay that absorption
can happen externally you see i've moved

18
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
can happen externally you see i've moved
 

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,470
can happen externally you see i've moved
that externally

20
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
that externally
 

21
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,109
that externally
that absorption can happen a mixture of

22
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
that absorption can happen a mixture of
 

23
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,229
that absorption can happen a mixture of
of external

24
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
of external
 

25
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,270
of external
and internal so i didn't have to move as

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
and internal so i didn't have to move as
 

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,389
and internal so i didn't have to move as
back as far and that absorption can

28
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
back as far and that absorption can
 

29
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,590
back as far and that absorption can
can be just internal to okay and i'll

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
can be just internal to okay and i'll
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,910
can be just internal to okay and i'll
show you what you can do with these so

32
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
show you what you can do with these so
 

33
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,750
show you what you can do with these so
um

34
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
um
 

35
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,270
um
what am i absorbing to i'm absorbing to

36
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
what am i absorbing to i'm absorbing to
 

37
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,910
what am i absorbing to i'm absorbing to
the ground

38
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
the ground
 

39
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,590
the ground
vector and outside of his power arc

40
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
vector and outside of his power arc
 

41
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,110
vector and outside of his power arc
okay so he's going to push there's

42
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
okay so he's going to push there's
 

43
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,510
okay so he's going to push there's
there's the ground vector and if you

44
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
there's the ground vector and if you
 

45
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,349
there's the ground vector and if you
don't move your feet

46
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
don't move your feet
 

47
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,109
don't move your feet
and you try to push just hold there

48
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
and you try to push just hold there
 

49
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,230
and you try to push just hold there
there push hard there you see he reached

50
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
there push hard there you see he reached
 

51
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,590
there push hard there you see he reached
the limit of his push

52
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
the limit of his push
 

53
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,070
the limit of his push
what would be the difference i'm inside

54
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
what would be the difference i'm inside
 

55
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,950
what would be the difference i'm inside
his his

56
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
his his
 

57
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,469
his his
arc his arc power i'm in here you see

58
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
arc his arc power i'm in here you see
 

59
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,190
arc his arc power i'm in here you see
and we do we do the same thing and i go

60
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
and we do we do the same thing and i go
 

61
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,590
and we do we do the same thing and i go
push

62
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
push
 

63
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,830
push
and he's gonna he's gonna displace me

64
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
and he's gonna he's gonna displace me
 

65
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,270
and he's gonna he's gonna displace me
okay

66
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
okay
 

67
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,149
okay
um you can do the combination so that

68
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
um you can do the combination so that
 

69
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,870
um you can do the combination so that
means that inside i'm i'm relaxing and

70
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
means that inside i'm i'm relaxing and
 

71
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,710
means that inside i'm i'm relaxing and
this energy is going really to the

72
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
this energy is going really to the
 

73
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,230
this energy is going really to the
ground very quickly

74
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
ground very quickly
 

75
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,670
ground very quickly
and because of that i don't have to

76
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
and because of that i don't have to
 

77
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,390
and because of that i don't have to
make an another external movement back

78
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
make an another external movement back
 

79
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,190
make an another external movement back
so i do an

80
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
so i do an
 

81
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,830
so i do an
external movement outside his power arc

82
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
external movement outside his power arc
 

83
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,190
external movement outside his power arc
and then

84
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
and then
 

85
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,469
and then
i move into it and i get to project him

86
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
i move into it and i get to project him
 

87
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,789
i move into it and i get to project him
okay so i can do it

88
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
okay so i can do it
 

89
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,830
okay so i can do it
a mixture of the two and i can do it

90
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
a mixture of the two and i can do it
 

91
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,630
a mixture of the two and i can do it
with just

92
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
with just
 

93
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,990
with just
internal this way it's just same thing

94
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
internal this way it's just same thing
 

95
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,630
internal this way it's just same thing
okay

96
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
okay
 

97
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,109
okay
so you're doing this technique and a lot

98
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
so you're doing this technique and a lot
 

99
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,910
so you're doing this technique and a lot
of you are staying in the power arc

100
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
of you are staying in the power arc
 

101
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,469
of you are staying in the power arc
so he goes to he goes to grab and you're

102
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
so he goes to he goes to grab and you're
 

103
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,229
so he goes to he goes to grab and you're
here

104
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
here
 

105
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,910
here
and again he's there

106
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
and again he's there
 

107
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,110
and again he's there
and if he pushes he's still got a lot of

108
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
and if he pushes he's still got a lot of
 

109
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,750
and if he pushes he's still got a lot of
umph

110
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
umph
 

111
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,190
umph
okay so when you do your deviation it's

112
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
okay so when you do your deviation it's
 

113
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,430
okay so when you do your deviation it's
got to be outside of that power arc

114
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
got to be outside of that power arc
 

115
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,790
got to be outside of that power arc
he pushes up he's at it full

116
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
he pushes up he's at it full
 

117
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,070
he pushes up he's at it full
power you see

118
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080

 

119
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,190

so i'm moving i'm out of it and

120
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
so i'm moving i'm out of it and
 

121
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,910
so i'm moving i'm out of it and
that's where i can come back okay

122
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
that's where i can come back okay
 

123
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,750
that's where i can come back okay
another way of looking at this is in

124
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
another way of looking at this is in
 

125
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,670
another way of looking at this is in
your yin and yang if you're inside this

126
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
your yin and yang if you're inside this
 

127
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,150
your yin and yang if you're inside this
power arc he's still on the yang face so

128
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
power arc he's still on the yang face so
 

129
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,990
power arc he's still on the yang face so
you can't go back in that would be a

130
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
you can't go back in that would be a
 

131
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,350
you can't go back in that would be a
yang young clash

132
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
yang young clash
 

133
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,830
yang young clash
okay so i move outside of that power

134
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
okay so i move outside of that power
 

135
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,509
okay so i move outside of that power
and then back in outside of the power

136
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
and then back in outside of the power
 

137
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,150
and then back in outside of the power
arc

138
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
arc
 

139
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:02,830
arc
on the map outside

140
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

141
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,949

outside

142
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959

 

143
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,030

so if you're inside the power arc let's

144
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
so if you're inside the power arc let's
 

145
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,710
so if you're inside the power arc let's
get to the question now what are you

146
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
get to the question now what are you
 

147
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,309
get to the question now what are you
adhering on

148
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
adhering on
 

149
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,990
adhering on
well if you're inside the power arc

150
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
well if you're inside the power arc
 

151
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,430
well if you're inside the power arc
you're not going to be adhering on

152
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
you're not going to be adhering on
 

153
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,309
you're not going to be adhering on
anything

154
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
anything
 

155
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,630
anything
because you're going to go young to yang

156
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
because you're going to go young to yang
 

157
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,430
because you're going to go young to yang
okay

158
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
okay
 

159
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,589
okay
and for the ik adhesion you have to be

160
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
and for the ik adhesion you have to be
 

161
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,630
and for the ik adhesion you have to be
at

162
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
at
 

163
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,869
at
that neutral that zero pressure i'm not

164
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
that neutral that zero pressure i'm not
 

165
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,350
that neutral that zero pressure i'm not
positive young i'm not negative again

166
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
positive young i'm not negative again
 

167
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,309
positive young i'm not negative again
okay so i gotta get to this part where

168
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
okay so i gotta get to this part where
 

169
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,750
okay so i gotta get to this part where
there's nothing left

170
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959

 

181
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,789

you bring it more external and you're

182
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
you bring it more external and you're
 

183
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,229
you bring it more external and you're
going to see i'm going to do less

184
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
going to see i'm going to do less
 

185
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,589
going to see i'm going to do less
movement meaning i am inside what

186
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
movement meaning i am inside what
 

187
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,789
movement meaning i am inside what
appears to be his

188
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
appears to be his
 

189
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,990
appears to be his
external power arc but because i'm

190
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
external power arc but because i'm
 

191
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,949
external power arc but because i'm
internally reconciling his energy he's

192
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
internally reconciling his energy he's
 

193
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,710
internally reconciling his energy he's
not really pushing on me

194
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
not really pushing on me
 

195
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,429
not really pushing on me
okay so this would be a big movement you

196
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
okay so this would be a big movement you
 

197
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,710
okay so this would be a big movement you
see

198
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
see
 

199
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,830
see
now you can do the same thing with small

200
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

201
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,270

movements

202
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280

 

203
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,550

then desean's question

204
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560

 

205
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,150

bring them around if you ghost

206
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160

207
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,749
bring them around if you ghost
if you lust for the immediate down

208
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
if you lust for the immediate down
 

209
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,990
if you lust for the immediate down
you're actually behind

210
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000

 

211
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,350

and he goes won't bring him

212
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
and he goes won't bring him
 

213
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,950
and he goes won't bring him
around and he is already

214
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
around and he is already
 

215
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,070

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
this is also going to condition you
 

221
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,310
this is also going to condition you
better

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
when you're applying these spirals
 

297
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,909
when you're applying these spirals
it's going to get like tight so i

298
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
it's going to get like tight so i
 

299
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,189

you're going to have to release it a
 

333
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,469
you're going to have to release it a
little and you'll never get there

334

little and you'll never get there
 

335
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,750

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
it's not like that okay so

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,310
it's not like that okay so
we're gonna work on getting onto the

inside what a spiral allows me to do
 

353
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,509
inside what a spiral allows me to do
is i don't have to work on the xy so

see the spiral
 

403
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,509
see the spiral
we see curves we see circles we see two

00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
we see curves we see circles we see two

really can't see that if we lose track

414
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
really can't see that if we lose track
 

415
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,870
really can't see that if we lose track
of the spiral if you've ever stared in a

416
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
of the spiral if you've ever stared in a

spiral
and after a while you're like wait is it

420
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
and after a while you're like wait is it
 

421
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,670
and after a while you're like wait is it
going forward is it going backwards

422
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
going forward is it going backwards
 

423
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,750
going forward is it going backwards
where's the end all that kind of it gets

424
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
where's the end all that kind of it gets
 

425
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,269
where's the end all that kind of it gets
it and that's kind of what's happening

426
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
it and that's kind of what's happening
 

427
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,670
it and that's kind of what's happening
in this technique is you guys so you

428
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
in this technique is you guys so you
 

429
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,150
in this technique is you guys so you
kind of like it's two-dimensional down

430
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
kind of like it's two-dimensional down
 

431
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,430
kind of like it's two-dimensional down
down and you're trying to oh

432
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
down and you're trying to oh
 

433
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,670
down and you're trying to oh
all right okay you're trying to go like

434
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
all right okay you're trying to go like
 

435
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,110
all right okay you're trying to go like
that

436
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
that
 

437
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,470
that
and then it gets loose okay so instead

438
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
and then it gets loose okay so instead
 

439
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,350
and then it gets loose okay so instead
it should get tighter so it's gonna it's

440
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
it should get tighter so it's gonna it's
 

441
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,710
it should get tighter so it's gonna it's
gonna get tighter

442
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
gonna get tighter
 

443
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
gonna get tighter
as i'm going around it so i won't loosen

444
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
as i'm going around it so i won't loosen
 

445
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,870
as i'm going around it so i won't loosen
it as i go and you're gonna see

446
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
it as i go and you're gonna see
 

447
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,470
it as i go and you're gonna see
he'll tap when you want to see so i

448
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
he'll tap when you want to see so i
 

449
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,590
he'll tap when you want to see so i
gotta loosen it and i'm going around it

450
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
gotta loosen it and i'm going around it
 

451
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,150
gotta loosen it and i'm going around it
it's on this side of me but i'm gonna go

452
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
it's on this side of me but i'm gonna go
 

453
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
it's on this side of me but i'm gonna go
around it

454
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
around it
 

455
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,670
around it
to the other side of it and then around

456
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
to the other side of it and then around
 

457
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,710
to the other side of it and then around
it

458
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
it
 

459
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,750
it
one more time so it's back in front of

460
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
one more time so it's back in front of
 

461
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:20,230
one more time so it's back in front of
me

462
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240

 

463
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,069

i'm on this side i'm going to get to the

464
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
i'm on this side i'm going to get to the
 

465
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,870
i'm on this side i'm going to get to the
other side the other side of it

466
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
other side the other side of it
 

467
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,710
other side the other side of it
and then i'm going to get back on the

468
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
and then i'm going to get back on the
 

469
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,750
and then i'm going to get back on the
other side of it back on the other side

470
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
other side of it back on the other side
 

471
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,230
other side of it back on the other side
not here back on the other side of it

472
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
not here back on the other side of it
 

473
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,389
not here back on the other side of it
so it stays in front of me

474
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
so it stays in front of me
 

475
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,949
so it stays in front of me
that's why it's a good drill okay just

476
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
that's why it's a good drill okay just
 

477
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,550
that's why it's a good drill okay just
loosen it up as your

478
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
loosen it up as your
 

479
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,310
loosen it up as your
uk shoulder needs to so you can practice

480
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
uk shoulder needs to so you can practice
 

481
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,360
uk shoulder needs to so you can practice
working this spiral okay
