1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,090

you can't block something

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,100

 

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,070

that doesn't

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,080
that doesn't
 

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,610
that doesn't
lock

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:10,620

 

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,129

so what am I doing I'm you I'm going

8
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:13,139
so what am I doing I'm you I'm going
 

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,870
so what am I doing I'm you I'm going
down another Street

10
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
down another Street
 

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,090
down another Street
in other words I'm working from this bit

12
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,100
in other words I'm working from this bit
 

13
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,849
in other words I'm working from this bit
down because this bit up is completely

14
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:19,859
down because this bit up is completely
 

15
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,769
down because this bit up is completely
blocked

16
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:21,779
blocked
 

17
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,370
blocked
I mean my modern sat now says

18
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,380
I mean my modern sat now says
 

19
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,290
I mean my modern sat now says
cues ahead

20
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,300
cues ahead
 

21
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,170
cues ahead
we have another route I'm gonna ignore

22
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,180
we have another route I'm gonna ignore
 

23
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,350
we have another route I'm gonna ignore
it that'll be fine

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360

 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,150

yeah so so when you're being blocked by

26
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
yeah so so when you're being blocked by
 

27
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,990
yeah so so when you're being blocked by
a powerful person

28
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000

 

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,030

yeah

30
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,040
yeah
 

31
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,389
yeah
I mean

32
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399

 

33
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,369

so coke you is actually understanding

34
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:55,379
so coke you is actually understanding
 

35
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,369
so coke you is actually understanding
it's not giving you more power

36
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:58,379
it's not giving you more power
 

37
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,830
it's not giving you more power
yes there is power if I want to unleash

38
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:00,840
yes there is power if I want to unleash
 

39
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,009
yes there is power if I want to unleash
the power I can unleash it

40
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:04,019
the power I can unleash it
 

41
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,410
the power I can unleash it
but I'm doing enough to make him fall

42
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:06,420
but I'm doing enough to make him fall
 

43
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,170
but I'm doing enough to make him fall
over so and that's all any of you will

44
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,180
over so and that's all any of you will
 

45
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,570
over so and that's all any of you will
want is it to get rid of them and to

46
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:11,580
want is it to get rid of them and to
 

47
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,750
want is it to get rid of them and to
look good at the end of it

48
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:14,760
look good at the end of it
 

49
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,149
look good at the end of it
so you're being blocked

50
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,159
so you're being blocked
 

51
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,550
so you're being blocked
so that's all I can tell you

52
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
so that's all I can tell you
 

53
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,070
so that's all I can tell you
but until you actually decide the sat

54
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
but until you actually decide the sat
 

55
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,749
but until you actually decide the sat
nav knows better what they don't

56
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
nav knows better what they don't
 

57
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,670
nav knows better what they don't
normally does it so that's a that's a

58
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
normally does it so that's a that's a
 

59
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,990
normally does it so that's a that's a
bad coincidence but General I mean

60
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,000
bad coincidence but General I mean
 

61
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,270
bad coincidence but General I mean
you've got to explore other places

62
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
you've got to explore other places
 

63
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,990
you've got to explore other places
because if you're blocked

64
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
because if you're blocked
 

65
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,670
because if you're blocked
if I was to do code and he blocks me

66
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
if I was to do code and he blocks me
 

67
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,890
if I was to do code and he blocks me
done my heart I

68
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:39,900
done my heart I
 

69
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,530
done my heart I
I'm here

70
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
I'm here
 

71
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,170
I'm here
so as you start to understand I'm now

72
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,180
so as you start to understand I'm now
 

73
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,670
so as you start to understand I'm now
going to do that but I'm actually going

74
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
going to do that but I'm actually going
 

75
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,210
going to do that but I'm actually going
to go here down not here up

76
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,220

 

77
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:01,730

so this is again Mass

78
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,740

 

79
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,170

so you're not going to understand

80
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,180
so you're not going to understand
 

81
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,389
so you're not going to understand
everything that I teach today of course

82
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
everything that I teach today of course
 

83
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,570
everything that I teach today of course
you're not but we'll try this again

84
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:08,580
you're not but we'll try this again
 

85
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,170
you're not but we'll try this again
and if a person blocks you

86
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,180
and if a person blocks you
 

87
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,570
and if a person blocks you
just trying to go through it thinking

88
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,580
just trying to go through it thinking
 

89
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,369
just trying to go through it thinking
that you've got the wrong technique

90
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:16,379
that you've got the wrong technique
 

91
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,589
that you've got the wrong technique
you're you're wrong you're you're

92
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
you're you're wrong you're you're
 

93
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,110
you're you're wrong you're you're
thinking wrong you've got to go where

94
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
thinking wrong you've got to go where
 

95
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,770
thinking wrong you've got to go where
you can go not where you come

96
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,780

 

97
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,110

the problem is you're trying to keep to

98
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
the problem is you're trying to keep to
 

99
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,150
the problem is you're trying to keep to
this sort of formula aren't you of

100
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
this sort of formula aren't you of
 

101
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,210
this sort of formula aren't you of
everything looking like this but this is

102
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,220
everything looking like this but this is
 

103
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,030
everything looking like this but this is
actually

104
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040

 

105
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,790

all down here you're you're shifting

106
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:37,800
all down here you're you're shifting
 

107
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,490
all down here you're you're shifting
your way you turn your hips the last

108
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:40,500
your way you turn your hips the last
 

109
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,130
your way you turn your hips the last
thing to actually move is the upper body

110
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,140
thing to actually move is the upper body
 

111
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,130
thing to actually move is the upper body
and the arms that's the last thing what

112
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
and the arms that's the last thing what
 

113
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,869
and the arms that's the last thing what
you're doing is you're going oh he's

114
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:47,879
you're doing is you're going oh he's
 

115
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,729
you're doing is you're going oh he's
blocked me

116
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:49,739
blocked me
 

117
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,150
blocked me
so you're not even getting to shifting

118
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,160
so you're not even getting to shifting
 

119
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,369
so you're not even getting to shifting
your weight turning your hips

120
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:55,379
your weight turning your hips
 

121
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,130
your weight turning your hips
to see if that'll work you're not even

122
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,140
to see if that'll work you're not even
 

123
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,290
to see if that'll work you're not even
getting that far to see if that bit will

124
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,300
getting that far to see if that bit will
 

125
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,480
getting that far to see if that bit will
work
