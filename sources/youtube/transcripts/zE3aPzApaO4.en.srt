1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,510

so drill three again you're going to go

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:04,520
so drill three again you're going to go
 

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,749
so drill three again you're going to go
to Y on the back foot and then y on the

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
to Y on the back foot and then y on the
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,749
to Y on the back foot and then y on the
front foot okay so it's it's uh you have

6
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
front foot okay so it's it's uh you have
 

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,030
front foot okay so it's it's uh you have
to do the full motion okay so you go

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,040
to do the full motion okay so you go
 

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,310
to do the full motion okay so you go
here and then the

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:19,320

 

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,550

projection take his ground and then move

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
projection take his ground and then move
 

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,950
projection take his ground and then move
forward try to relax as you feel both

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:27,960
forward try to relax as you feel both
 

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,150
forward try to relax as you feel both
his pressure and as you increase it as

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
his pressure and as you increase it as
 

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,709
his pressure and as you increase it as
you go forward stay

18
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:37,719

 

19
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,750

relaxed okay so your knees do have to go

20
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:40,760
relaxed okay so your knees do have to go
 

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,590
relaxed okay so your knees do have to go
that far on exercise three okay a detail

22
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
that far on exercise three okay a detail
 

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,389
that far on exercise three okay a detail
so when he comes in with his linear uh

24
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
so when he comes in with his linear uh
 

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,029
so when he comes in with his linear uh
Force right it has a rate he decides the

26
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
Force right it has a rate he decides the
 

27
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,830
Force right it has a rate he decides the
rate okay uh that he's going to put into

28
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
rate okay uh that he's going to put into
 

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,029
rate okay uh that he's going to put into
the equation but I decide at at what

30
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
the equation but I decide at at what
 

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,910
the equation but I decide at at what
rate it moves me onto the back foot okay

32
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
rate it moves me onto the back foot okay
 

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,390
rate it moves me onto the back foot okay
so for example I'm I'm in on me I I can

34
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
so for example I'm I'm in on me I I can
 

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,270
so for example I'm I'm in on me I I can
still ground from here you can't push me

36
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
still ground from here you can't push me
 

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,230
still ground from here you can't push me
over okay and so I decide at what rate

38
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
over okay and so I decide at what rate
 

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,429
over okay and so I decide at what rate
we go onto the back foot okay uh and

40
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
we go onto the back foot okay uh and
 

41
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,070
we go onto the back foot okay uh and
that is important because in this drill

42
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
that is important because in this drill
 

43
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,149
that is important because in this drill
I'm not doing any absorption with my

44
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
I'm not doing any absorption with my
 

45
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,870
I'm not doing any absorption with my
hands okay so the absorption is all my

46
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:21,880
hands okay so the absorption is all my
 

47
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,390
hands okay so the absorption is all my
is on my uh weight

48
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
is on my uh weight
 

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,670
is on my uh weight
shifting so if I go if I go at One Rate

50
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
shifting so if I go if I go at One Rate
 

51
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,950
shifting so if I go if I go at One Rate
you're going to see that ah man it was

52
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,960
you're going to see that ah man it was
 

53
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,230
you're going to see that ah man it was
he was too fast for the rate that I

54
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
he was too fast for the rate that I
 

55
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,350
he was too fast for the rate that I
allowed to get my weight onto that back

56
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,360
allowed to get my weight onto that back
 

57
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,510
allowed to get my weight onto that back
foot and it goes into your shoulders

58
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:36,520
foot and it goes into your shoulders
 

59
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,350
foot and it goes into your shoulders
okay I contact your grounding your

60
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,360
okay I contact your grounding your
 

61
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,510
okay I contact your grounding your
grounding ball and you decide the rate

62
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:42,520
grounding ball and you decide the rate
 

63
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,590
grounding ball and you decide the rate
and so I decide the rate as I go forward

64
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,600
and so I decide the rate as I go forward
 

65
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,069
and so I decide the rate as I go forward
here okay so I don't want my hands to

66
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,079
here okay so I don't want my hands to
 

67
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,950
here okay so I don't want my hands to
move uh in and out on exercise three I

68
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
move uh in and out on exercise three I
 

69
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,149
move uh in and out on exercise three I
decide the rate that we go back and boom

70
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
decide the rate that we go back and boom
 

71
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,510
decide the rate that we go back and boom
I decide the rate that we go

72
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,520
I decide the rate that we go
 

73
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:07,550
I decide the rate that we go
forward I decide the rate forward

74
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,560

 

75
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,390

okay try it again in uh in your art

76
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
okay try it again in uh in your art
 

77
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,110
okay try it again in uh in your art
we're going to displace your base right

78
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,120
we're going to displace your base right
 

79
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,910
we're going to displace your base right
so we're going to use that

80
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
so we're going to use that
 

81
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,350
so we're going to use that
triangular angle of

82

okay Kam is not necessary to project you
 

91
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,589
okay Kam is not necessary to project you
okay and so uh drill four will show that

92
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
okay and so uh drill four will show that
 

93
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,070
okay and so uh drill four will show that
but I would like to show you how in uh

okay so I want you to pay attention to
when he actually

100
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
when he actually
 

101
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,270
when he actually
leaves me okay if you pay

102
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
leaves me okay if you pay
 

103
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,670
leaves me okay if you pay
attention it's not when I get there

104

attention it's not when I get there
 

105
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,190
attention it's not when I get there
that's not when he Le leav okay

106
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
that's not when he Le leav okay
 

107
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,470
that's not when he Le leav okay
boom I not there yet do you see that

108
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
boom I not there yet do you see that
 

109
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,789
boom I not there yet do you see that
okay and this goes

110
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799
okay and this goes
 

111
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,309
okay and this goes
to the fact that my back

112
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
to the fact that my back
 

113
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,710
to the fact that my back
foot uh should never unground so I

114
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
foot uh should never unground so I
 

115
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,750
foot uh should never unground so I
shouldn't ever go boom and boom and I'm

116
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:20,760
shouldn't ever go boom and boom and I'm
 

117
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,750
shouldn't ever go boom and boom and I'm
pushing with my back foot okay the back

118
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
pushing with my back foot okay the back
 

119
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,670
pushing with my back foot okay the back
foot stays heavy throughout the movement

120
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680
foot stays heavy throughout the movement
 

121
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,630
foot stays heavy throughout the movement
okay drill four if you were pushing with

122
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,640
okay drill four if you were pushing with

that way do you understand so drill four

138
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:52,840
that way do you understand so drill four
 

139
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,550
that way do you understand so drill four
is to emphasize that and in drill four

140
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
is to emphasize that and in drill four
 

141
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,350
is to emphasize that and in drill four
my front knee does not leave the yin

the back foot I still have to do that

152
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
the back foot I still have to do that
 

153
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,189
the back foot I still have to do that
but I just go to knee

154

but I just go to knee
 

155
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,590
but I just go to knee
straight that's all I do here

156
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600

 

157
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:38,070

like drill three drill three is going to
 

163
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,909
like drill three drill three is going to
give you your your uh triangular sound

164
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
give you your your uh triangular sound
 

165
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,830
give you your your uh triangular sound
you see that we use do you get it so

166
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,840
you see that we use do you get it so
 

167
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,670
you see that we use do you get it so
what where I threw and how I threw is

168
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
what where I threw and how I threw is
 

169
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,790
what where I threw and how I threw is
the same internal components it's still

170
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:55,800
the same internal components it's still
 

171
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,029
the same internal components it's still
a Coq projection okay but now uh we have

172
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:00,039
a Coq projection okay but now uh we have
 

173
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,270
a Coq projection okay but now uh we have
a drill four okay why do we need drill

174
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
a drill four okay why do we need drill
 

175
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,150
a drill four okay why do we need drill
four just like you needed drill three

176
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160
four just like you needed drill three
 

177
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,510
four just like you needed drill three
okay why didn't we just stick with

178
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
okay why didn't we just stick with
 

179
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,510
okay why didn't we just stick with
standing

180
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
standing
 

181
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,390
standing
meditation uh because we need checks and

182
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
meditation uh because we need checks and
 

183
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,950
meditation uh because we need checks and
balances you see so each drill is not

184
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
balances you see so each drill is not
 

185
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,029
balances you see so each drill is not
necessarily a harder skill it's just

186
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:18,039
necessarily a harder skill it's just
 

187
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,510
necessarily a harder skill it's just
less capable of being duplicated by

188
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
less capable of being duplicated by
 

189
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,590
less capable of being duplicated by
external Force engines okay that's what

190
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
external Force engines okay that's what
 

191
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,749
external Force engines okay that's what
that's what it's doing so you may find

192
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:26,759
that's what it's doing so you may find
 

193
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,670
that's what it's doing so you may find
at this point damn I can't I can't do

194
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
at this point damn I can't I can't do
 

195
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,909
at this point damn I can't I can't do
this well the same way if you found if

196
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
this well the same way if you found if
 

197
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:34,469
this well the same way if you found if
if you thought you were doing standing

198
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
if you thought you were doing standing
 

199
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,110
if you thought you were doing standing
meditation but you could not ground

200
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
meditation but you could not ground
 

201
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,950
meditation but you could not ground
Vector in drill two then you weren't

202
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
Vector in drill two then you weren't
 

203
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,230
Vector in drill two then you weren't
doing standing meditation okay so

204
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,240
doing standing meditation okay so
 

205
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,029
doing standing meditation okay so
likewise if you thought you were

206
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,039
likewise if you thought you were
 

207
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,550
likewise if you thought you were
projecting and that guy moved backwards

208
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
projecting and that guy moved backwards
 

209
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,150
projecting and that guy moved backwards
if you find in drill three the guy moved

210
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
if you find in drill three the guy moved
 

211
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,350
if you find in drill three the guy moved
backwards cuz you're projecting and you

212
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
backwards cuz you're projecting and you
 

213
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,230
backwards cuz you're projecting and you
didn't realize you're just pushing him

214
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
didn't realize you're just pushing him
 

215
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,110
didn't realize you're just pushing him
into this bracing angle instead of

216
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,120
into this bracing angle instead of
 

217
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,510
into this bracing angle instead of
realizing he's already gone he has to be

218
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,520
realizing he's already gone he has to be
 

219
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,990
realizing he's already gone he has to be
gone for me to enter

220
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
gone for me to enter
 

221
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,110
gone for me to enter
he leaves about this part okay drill

222
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
he leaves about this part okay drill
 

223
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,749
he leaves about this part okay drill
four is going that's all you get is that

224
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
four is going that's all you get is that
 

225
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,309
four is going that's all you get is that
part let's see if he left or not okay

226
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
part let's see if he left or not okay
 

227
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,749
part let's see if he left or not okay
making it harder all right got it so as

228
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
making it harder all right got it so as
 

229
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,749
making it harder all right got it so as
I as I'm doing this uh everything should

230
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:14,759
I as I'm doing this uh everything should
 

231
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,309
I as I'm doing this uh everything should
be the same if it's not the same then

232
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
be the same if it's not the same then
 

233
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,629
be the same if it's not the same then
it's cuz I'm not doing it I didn't do it

234
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
it's cuz I'm not doing it I didn't do it
 

235
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,390
it's cuz I'm not doing it I didn't do it
that's what happened that's how these

236
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
that's what happened that's how these
 

237
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,909
that's what happened that's how these
drills work okay so again it doesn't

238
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:26,919
drills work okay so again it doesn't
 

239
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,749
drills work okay so again it doesn't
matter um we had a question question

240
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
matter um we had a question question
 

241
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,510
matter um we had a question question
over here is like when I straighten my

242
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
over here is like when I straighten my
 

243
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,950
over here is like when I straighten my
leg I feel like I'm on my heel and he

244
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:33,960
leg I feel like I'm on my heel and he
 

245
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,350
leg I feel like I'm on my heel and he
can push me over again the shape of the

246
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,360
can push me over again the shape of the
 

247
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,550
can push me over again the shape of the
front leg does not matter that's why I

248
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
front leg does not matter that's why I
 

249
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,150
front leg does not matter that's why I
take the take it off a lot to show you

250
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,160
take the take it off a lot to show you
 

251
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,870
take the take it off a lot to show you
that if the leg the leg can do anything

252
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:43,880
that if the leg the leg can do anything
 

253
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,870
that if the leg the leg can do anything
it doesn't matter I'm still grounding

254
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
it doesn't matter I'm still grounding
 

255
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,830
it doesn't matter I'm still grounding
okay you get

256
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:48,840
okay you get
 

257
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,589
okay you get
it

258
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:50,599
it
 

259
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,710
it
so but our drill has a rule so I'm in k

260
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
so but our drill has a rule so I'm in k
 

261
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,110
so but our drill has a rule so I'm in k
a i would be in k a but I don't go to k

262
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,120
a i would be in k a but I don't go to k
 

263
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,990
a i would be in k a but I don't go to k
a i just go to there that's all I'm

264
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,000
a i just go to there that's all I'm
 

265
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,550
a i just go to there that's all I'm
doing in Dr four on pull

266
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
doing in Dr four on pull
 

267
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,589
doing in Dr four on pull
off and I release and relax on off okay

268
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:10,599
off and I release and relax on off okay
 

269
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,230
off and I release and relax on off okay
try it

270
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
try it
 

271
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,430
try it
again okay I kind of gave it away in the

272
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
again okay I kind of gave it away in the
 

273
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,469
again okay I kind of gave it away in the
in my last demo where I said the leg's

274
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:17,479
in my last demo where I said the leg's
 

275
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,589
in my last demo where I said the leg's
not important okay uh for a lot of

276
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:20,599
not important okay uh for a lot of
 

277
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,830
not important okay uh for a lot of
people to start uh I and I even I to

278
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:24,840
people to start uh I and I even I to
 

279
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,469
people to start uh I and I even I to
start the leg's important okay but if

280
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
start the leg's important okay but if
 

281
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,070
start the leg's important okay but if
you think that it has a particular

282
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
you think that it has a particular
 

283
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,629
you think that it has a particular
shape uh your I'm sorry your Li your

284
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:33,639
shape uh your I'm sorry your Li your
 

285
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,670
shape uh your I'm sorry your Li your
understanding is very limited okay it

286
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
understanding is very limited okay it
 

287
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,990
understanding is very limited okay it
does not have a shape it's it's about

288
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
does not have a shape it's it's about
 

289
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,950
does not have a shape it's it's about
formlessness so it doesn't matter how I

290
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
formlessness so it doesn't matter how I
 

291
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,830
formlessness so it doesn't matter how I
stand it doesn't doesn't even matter

292
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
stand it doesn't doesn't even matter
 

293
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,749
stand it doesn't doesn't even matter
that I'm on that midfoot that is not

294
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
that I'm on that midfoot that is not
 

295
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,830
that I'm on that midfoot that is not
that's just to get me in the ballpark

296
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
that's just to get me in the ballpark
 

297
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,469
that's just to get me in the ballpark
okay it's not relevant it's may be

298
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
okay it's not relevant it's may be
 

299
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,749
okay it's not relevant it's may be
relevant for Marshall concerns but in

300
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:52,759
relevant for Marshall concerns but in
 

301
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,270
relevant for Marshall concerns but in
terms of what we're doing with this

302
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,280
terms of what we're doing with this
 

303
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,469
terms of what we're doing with this
internal Force engine is not relevant

304
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
internal Force engine is not relevant
 

305
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,950
internal Force engine is not relevant
okay so if you look at these drills as

306
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
okay so if you look at these drills as
 

307
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,430
okay so if you look at these drills as
are get get harder and as I said we're

308
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
are get get harder and as I said we're
 

309
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,070
are get get harder and as I said we're
making them

310
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,080
making them
 

311
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,990
making them
less um duplicatable by external Force

312
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,000
less um duplicatable by external Force
 

313
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,869
less um duplicatable by external Force
engines what we're doing is we're taking

314
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:09,879
engines what we're doing is we're taking
 

315
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,629
engines what we're doing is we're taking
advantage of the fact that I don't need

316
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
advantage of the fact that I don't need
 

317
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,110
advantage of the fact that I don't need
an anatomical structure to do these kind

318
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
an anatomical structure to do these kind
 

319
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,869
an anatomical structure to do these kind
of things okay um so on this next one uh

320
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:19,879
of things okay um so on this next one uh
 

321
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,749
of things okay um so on this next one uh
drill five I'm actually going to go in

322
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:22,759
drill five I'm actually going to go in
 

323
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,990
drill five I'm actually going to go in
go into him okay so he's walking at me

324
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
go into him okay so he's walking at me
 

325
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,230
go into him okay so he's walking at me
and I walking to

326
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
and I walking to
 

327
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,230
and I walking to
him

328
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
him
 

329
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,990
him
but I'm not going to bra there's not a

330
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,000
but I'm not going to bra there's not a
 

331
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,870
but I'm not going to bra there's not a
class where it goes into my shoulders or

332
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:35,880
class where it goes into my shoulders or
 

333
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,550
class where it goes into my shoulders or
anything uh and so I won't have

334
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:39,560
anything uh and so I won't have
 

335
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,150
anything uh and so I won't have
necessarily perfect midfoot whatever is

336
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,160
necessarily perfect midfoot whatever is
 

337
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,670
necessarily perfect midfoot whatever is
touching I let that bounce off of there

338
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
touching I let that bounce off of there
 

339
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,230
touching I let that bounce off of there
and I project okay so we're walking at

340
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
and I project okay so we're walking at
 

341
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,190
and I project okay so we're walking at
each other

342
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200

 

343
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:14,190

and

344
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200

 

345
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,110

okay let's try it all right drill

346
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
okay let's try it all right drill
 

347
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,550
okay let's try it all right drill
five is doesn't change anything so my

348
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560
five is doesn't change anything so my
 

349
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,069
five is doesn't change anything so my
hands aren't going to go here and and

350
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:24,079
hands aren't going to go here and and
 

351
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,190
hands aren't going to go here and and
then project out okay I leave I leave my

352
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
then project out okay I leave I leave my
 

353
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,829
then project out okay I leave I leave my
hands where they are you might see this

354
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
hands where they are you might see this
 

355
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,949
hands where they are you might see this
kind of like he he pulsed on it but once

356
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
kind of like he he pulsed on it but once
 

357
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,829
kind of like he he pulsed on it but once
they pulse then I don't keep projecting

358
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
they pulse then I don't keep projecting
 

359
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,389
they pulse then I don't keep projecting
out okay um the wave that you're seeing

360
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:39,399
out okay um the wave that you're seeing
 

361
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,470
out okay um the wave that you're seeing
isn't so much in me it's that his energy

362
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
isn't so much in me it's that his energy
 

363
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,990
isn't so much in me it's that his energy
is going to the ground and then comes

364
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,000
is going to the ground and then comes
 

365
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,829
is going to the ground and then comes
back just depends on what you're looking

366
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:46,839
back just depends on what you're looking
 

367
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,350
back just depends on what you're looking
at so I think most people that see this

368
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,360
at so I think most people that see this
 

369
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,750
at so I think most people that see this
they realize he it looks like he came in

370
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
they realize he it looks like he came in
 

371
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,910
they realize he it looks like he came in
and then he bounced back and then the

372
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
and then he bounced back and then the
 

373
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,590
and then he bounced back and then the
EGP part mind goes and he went in and

374
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,600
EGP part mind goes and he went in and
 

375
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,990
EGP part mind goes and he went in and
then he went out okay but I think if you

376
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,000
then he went out okay but I think if you
 

377
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,550
then he went out okay but I think if you
just focus on my hands either plot them

378
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
just focus on my hands either plot them
 

379
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,870
just focus on my hands either plot them
in space or my elbows or something like

380
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
in space or my elbows or something like
 

381
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,710
in space or my elbows or something like
that and you see that's not actually

382
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
that and you see that's not actually
 

383
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,310
that and you see that's not actually
what happens although he looks like he's

384
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,320
what happens although he looks like he's
 

385
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,069
what happens although he looks like he's
rebounding okay so we're walking at each

386
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
rebounding okay so we're walking at each
 

387
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,550
rebounding okay so we're walking at each
other my hands are

388
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
other my hands are
 

389
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,440
other my hands are
loose hands are just

390
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,450

 

391
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,949

[Applause]

392
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:25,959
[Applause]
 

393
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,910
[Applause]
loose not not going like this

394
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
loose not not going like this
 

395
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,430
loose not not going like this
that's that's something else okay I'm

396
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:32,440
that's that's something else okay I'm
 

397
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,629
that's that's something else okay I'm
not doing that just

398
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:35,639
not doing that just
 

399
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,030
not doing that just
absorb in and through me okay so the the

400
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
absorb in and through me okay so the the
 

401
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,030
absorb in and through me okay so the the
rebounding that you're seeing is

402
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
rebounding that you're seeing is
 

403
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,870
rebounding that you're seeing is
important because that's the energy

404
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
important because that's the energy
 

405
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,870
important because that's the energy
that's going through me but it's not

406
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
that's going through me but it's not
 

407
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,150
that's going through me but it's not
that I do it externally with my arms

408
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,160
that I do it externally with my arms
 

409
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,710
that I do it externally with my arms
okay not in this drill

410
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
okay not in this drill
 

411
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,350
okay not in this drill
try Okay drill six I take away the

412
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
try Okay drill six I take away the
 

413
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,190
try Okay drill six I take away the
bracing angle okay so he's pushing and

414
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
bracing angle okay so he's pushing and
 

415
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,829
bracing angle okay so he's pushing and
we could do drill six is where I'm just

416
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
we could do drill six is where I'm just
 

417
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,949
we could do drill six is where I'm just
here if he lets go I don't go flying no

418
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:05,959
here if he lets go I don't go flying no
 

419
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,190
here if he lets go I don't go flying no
I should just stay where I'm at he lets

420
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,200
I should just stay where I'm at he lets
 

421
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,269
I should just stay where I'm at he lets
go

422
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
go
 

423
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,509
go
boom or drill seven you can

424
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:12,519
boom or drill seven you can
 

425
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,829
boom or drill seven you can
project so I'm not going backwards okay

426
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
project so I'm not going backwards okay
 

427
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,350
project so I'm not going backwards okay
there's it's hard to do the weight

428
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
there's it's hard to do the weight
 

429
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,110
there's it's hard to do the weight
shifting so I will allow that you're

430
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,120
shifting so I will allow that you're
 

431
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,710
shifting so I will allow that you're
going to use your arms here ground or

432
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:23,720
going to use your arms here ground or
 

433
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,389
going to use your arms here ground or
and you won't fly backwards if you're

434
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:25,399
and you won't fly backwards if you're
 

435
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,949
and you won't fly backwards if you're
grounding properly you won't fly

436
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
grounding properly you won't fly
 

437
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,470
grounding properly you won't fly
backwards

438
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:29,480
backwards
 

439
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,230
backwards
just like you wouldn't fall forward okay

440
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
just like you wouldn't fall forward okay
 

441
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,030
just like you wouldn't fall forward okay
if you're not grounding properly when

442
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,040
if you're not grounding properly when
 

443
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,389
if you're not grounding properly when
you push him You' be pushing yourself

444
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
you push him You' be pushing yourself
 

445
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,590
you push him You' be pushing yourself
over okay so drill six you could do it

446
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,600
over okay so drill six you could do it
 

447
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,670
over okay so drill six you could do it
static drill seven project and stay

448
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
static drill seven project and stay
 

449
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,110
static drill seven project and stay
static okay and I'm allowing some arm

450
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,120
static okay and I'm allowing some arm
 

451
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,670
static okay and I'm allowing some arm
movement

452
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680

 

453
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,190

in but as I do my arms they're very

454
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200

 

455
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,590

relaxed when again if you pay attention

456
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,600
relaxed when again if you pay attention
 

457
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,150
relaxed when again if you pay attention
he's gone there you see my arms don't

458
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
he's gone there you see my arms don't
 

459
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,069
he's gone there you see my arms don't
need to go there they go there because

460
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
need to go there they go there because
 

461
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,110
need to go there they go there because
our art continues the IES we're it

462
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
our art continues the IES we're it
 

463
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,310
our art continues the IES we're it
either sticks or it follows okay so you

464
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
either sticks or it follows okay so you
 

465
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,590
either sticks or it follows okay so you
should train for stick and following but

466
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
should train for stick and following but
 

467
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:21,670
should train for stick and following but
he should be gone on this part

468
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680

 

469
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,710

boom okay let's

470
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:25,720

 

471
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,350

try Okay uh the same drills can be done

472
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
try Okay uh the same drills can be done
 

473
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,710
try Okay uh the same drills can be done
with a weapon on a

474
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:31,720
with a weapon on a
 

475
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,670
with a weapon on a
person and then also a weapon against a

476
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,680
person and then also a weapon against a
 

477
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,750
person and then also a weapon against a
weapon okay so we're not going to go

478
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:36,760
weapon okay so we're not going to go
 

479
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,990
weapon okay so we're not going to go
into those things um but just just to

480
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,000
into those things um but just just to
 

481
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,389
into those things um but just just to
understand especially ski ski is very

482
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:43,399
