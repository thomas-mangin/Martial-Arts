00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,230
do you see that and he's waiting for the
pressure to stop

112
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
pressure to stop
 

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,469
pressure to stop
well if that that means that that move

114
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
well if that that means that that move
 

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,670
well if that that means that that move
could have

116
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
getting to the back of him
 

429
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,430
getting to the back of him
he gets to the front of me okay so he

430
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
he gets to the front of me okay so he
 

431
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,230
he gets to the front of me okay so he
goes

already
 

445
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,949
already
okay just that drill at least get your

446
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
okay just that drill at least get your
 

447
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,990
okay just that drill at least get your
head

448

head
behind that corner go okay so this

450
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
behind that corner go okay so this
 

451
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,150
behind that corner go okay so this
this the strategy is the strategy of

452
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
this the strategy is the strategy of
 

453
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,949
this the strategy is the strategy of
jiu-jitsu

454
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
jiu-jitsu
 

455
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,150
jiu-jitsu
yield okay but you need the

456
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
yield okay but you need the
 

457
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,750
yield okay but you need the
internal aspects too so if i go here

458
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
internal aspects too so if i go here
 

459
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,629
internal aspects too so if i go here
and will you mind leaning on me get your

460
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
and will you mind leaning on me get your
 

461
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,430
and will you mind leaning on me get your
feet out

462
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
feet out
 

463
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,389
feet out
so you can lean you see i'm actually

464
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
so you can lean you see i'm actually
 

465
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,829
so you can lean you see i'm actually
stopping in the entire time

466
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
stopping in the entire time
 

467
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,710
stopping in the entire time
stopping okay that's not right

468
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720

 

469
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,110

but getting out of the way isn't it

470
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
but getting out of the way isn't it
 

471
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,230
but getting out of the way isn't it
either because he has his balance

472
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
either because he has his balance
 

473
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,509
either because he has his balance
so when i do when i yield it i have to

474
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
so when i do when i yield it i have to
 

475
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,310
so when i do when i yield it i have to
generate

476
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
generate
 

477
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,790
generate
i can't go negative but i can't be

478
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
i can't go negative but i can't be
 

479
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,430
i can't go negative but i can't be
positive

480
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
positive
 

481
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,670
positive
i got half the class negative and half

482
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
i got half the class negative and half
 

483
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,030
i got half the class negative and half
the class positive

484
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
the class positive
 

485
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,069
the class positive
it has to be neutral okay so

486
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
it has to be neutral okay so
 

487
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,389
it has to be neutral okay so
i'm always riding that neutral so that i

488
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
i'm always riding that neutral so that i
 

489
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,430
i'm always riding that neutral so that i
can get those

490
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
can get those
 

491
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,710
can get those
adhesions which is aikido

492
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
adhesions which is aikido
 

493
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,509
adhesions which is aikido
so yes strategy is yield but yeah you're

494
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
so yes strategy is yield but yeah you're
 

495
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,189
so yes strategy is yield but yeah you're
yielding but you're positive

496
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
yielding but you're positive
 

497
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,590
yielding but you're positive
or you're yielding and you're negative

498
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
or you're yielding and you're negative
 

499
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,470
or you're yielding and you're negative
he has to

500
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
he has to
 

501
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,750
he has to
he has to move in front of me okay

502
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
he has to move in front of me okay
 

503
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,749
he has to move in front of me okay
if i leave him out there of course he's

504
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
if i leave him out there of course he's
 

505
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,150
if i leave him out there of course he's
never going to get in front of me

506
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
never going to get in front of me
 

507
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,829
never going to get in front of me
but if i leave him there he's not going

508
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
but if i leave him there he's not going
 

509
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,350
but if i leave him there he's not going
to get in front of me and i have to be

510
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
to get in front of me and i have to be
 

511
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,829
to get in front of me and i have to be
the one to move

512
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
the one to move
 

513
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,350
the one to move
so i yield so that i stick

514
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
so i yield so that i stick
 

515
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,710
so i yield so that i stick
i keep moving him keep moving him

516
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720

 

517
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,949

stick there's balance but that's

518
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
stick there's balance but that's
 

519
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,829
stick there's balance but that's
stopping bring it this way

520
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
stopping bring it this way
 

521
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,829

another adhesion here
 

633
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,830
another adhesion here
and then i use it to project

634
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
and then i use it to project
 

635
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,590

but it's like three stages so engage
 

643
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,470
