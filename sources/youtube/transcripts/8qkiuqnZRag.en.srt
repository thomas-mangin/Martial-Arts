00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,790

you have to

2
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
you have to
 

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,710
you have to
get his elbow to go in

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,190

and then there must be weight on it

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,200
and then there must be weight on it
 

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,430
and then there must be weight on it
so you can't have his arm stay straight

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
so you can't have his arm stay straight
 

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,729
so you can't have his arm stay straight
and his elbow go down and not in

I'm going to use this motion here to
 

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:02,209
I'm going to use this motion here to
make his elbow go in and my weight is on

down here because you don't have
leverage on it okay you need some part

90
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
leverage on it okay you need some part
 

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,410
leverage on it okay you need some part
of the blade to cut but I should be down

92
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,420
of the blade to cut but I should be down
 

93
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,990
of the blade to cut but I should be down
by the edge so I'm controlling the

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
by the edge so I'm controlling the
 

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,229

but a very very important part

100
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,580
but a very very important part
 

101
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,850
but a very very important part
is that he's moving

102
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:49,860
is that he's moving
 

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,309
is that he's moving
okay he keeps moving

104
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
okay he keeps moving
 

105
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,630
okay he keeps moving
he should not stay there

106
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640

 

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,309

no
so when his attack comes I take that

112
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:04,019
so when his attack comes I take that
 

113
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,250
so when his attack comes I take that
into uh the kazushi and that's where

114
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,260
into uh the kazushi and that's where
 

115
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,110
into uh the kazushi and that's where
he's gonna fall so where he's gonna fall

116
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,120
he's gonna fall so where he's gonna fall
 

117

the cat you can't have uh let's say I

118
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,480

119
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,170
the cat you can't have uh let's say I
have my firearm here and if he goes to

120
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,180
have my firearm here and if he goes to
 

121
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,110
have my firearm here and if he goes to
grab my firearm I'm not gonna

122
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
grab my firearm I'm not gonna
 

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,290
grab my firearm I'm not gonna
do that stuff you see he goes to grab my

124
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,300
do that stuff you see he goes to grab my
 

125
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,270
do that stuff you see he goes to grab my
firearm and it's already moving out of

126
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280
firearm and it's already moving out of
 

127
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,270
firearm and it's already moving out of
the way okay

128
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280

 

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,550

so when I see him go to attack and see

130
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
so when I see him go to attack and see
 

131
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,890
so when I see him go to attack and see
how I move and then he keeps moving

132
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900

 

133
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,070

okay so those two things he he's gonna

134
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
okay so those two things he he's gonna
 

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,110
okay so those two things he he's gonna
keep moving because I'm gonna let him

136
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,120
keep moving because I'm gonna let him
 

137
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,909

138
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
keep moving I'm gonna let him keep
 

139
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,650
keep moving I'm gonna let him keep
moving because I played a hole for him

140
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
moving because I played a hole for him
 

141
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,090
moving because I played a hole for him
to fall into okay and then control as

142
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,100
to fall into okay and then control as
 

143
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,189
to fall into okay and then control as
much of the weapon as possible you can't

144
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
much of the weapon as possible you can't
 

145
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,930
much of the weapon as possible you can't
be down here because you'll be hiding

146
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:53,940
be down here because you'll be hiding
 

147
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,330
be down here because you'll be hiding
the cutting portion but this isn't going

148
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,340
the cutting portion but this isn't going
 

149
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,290
the cutting portion but this isn't going
to work

150
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,300
to work
 

151
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,350
to work
somewhere around here okay all right

152
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360
somewhere around here okay all right
 

153
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,510
somewhere around here okay all right
let's try

154
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
let's try
 

155
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,270
let's try
so uh

156
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
so uh
 

157
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,469
so uh
here what I'm doing is an adhesion in

158
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:09,479
here what I'm doing is an adhesion in
 

159
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,290
here what I'm doing is an adhesion in
his on his palm okay but I'm using my

160
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
his on his palm okay but I'm using my
 

161
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,110
his on his palm okay but I'm using my
forearm okay it's not that I'm

162
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
forearm okay it's not that I'm
 

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,270
forearm okay it's not that I'm
leveraging this stuff I'm not I'm not

164
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
leveraging this stuff I'm not I'm not
 

165
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,870
leveraging this stuff I'm not I'm not
trying to leverage this okay

166
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
trying to leverage this okay
 

167
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,650
trying to leverage this okay
so the adhesion goes into the palm

168
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:24,660
so the adhesion goes into the palm
 

169
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,409
so the adhesion goes into the palm
okay that that's what's moving him

170
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:27,419
okay that that's what's moving him
 

171
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,350
okay that that's what's moving him
around that's what's opening them up and

172
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,360
around that's what's opening them up and
 

173
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,830
around that's what's opening them up and
then feel feel this okay here I am here

174
