1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,470

Okay. I feel myself

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay. I feel myself
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,349
Okay. I feel myself
tense up in those moments that I was

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
tense up in those moments that I was
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,670
tense up in those moments that I was
thrown before I thought I would be

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
thrown before I thought I would be
 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,910
thrown before I thought I would be
throwing. Like Virginia had a couple of

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
throwing. Like Virginia had a couple of
 

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,549
throwing. Like Virginia had a couple of
spirals that really caught me. And I

10
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
spirals that really caught me. And I
 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,870
spirals that really caught me. And I
could feel what I thought was relaxed

12
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
could feel what I thought was relaxed
 

13
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,349
could feel what I thought was relaxed
initially. I could feel all that go away

14
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
initially. I could feel all that go away
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,390
initially. I could feel all that go away
in that moment of surprise. Yes.

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400

 

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,710

The uh here's a another thing to think

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
The uh here's a another thing to think
 

19
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,430
The uh here's a another thing to think
about.

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,190

Um,

22
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200

because I want to make the point

40
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
because I want to make the point
 

41
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,869
because I want to make the point

00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
going to let me make the point that I
 

45
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,070
going to let me make the point that I
actually

46
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
actually
 

47
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,750

class. Tell you the truth, it worked out
 

71
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,789
class. Tell you the truth, it worked out
a lot easier. Although the loading takes

72
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
a lot easier. Although the loading takes
 

73
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,630
a lot easier. Although the loading takes
a long time. The editing takes a long

74
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
a long time. The editing takes a long
 

75
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,190
a long time. The editing takes a long
time. So just like I'm tired, too, and I

time. So just like I'm tired, too, and I
 

77
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,630
time. So just like I'm tired, too, and I
don't want to go home and try to edit. I

78
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
don't want to go home and try to edit. I
 

79
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,710
don't want to go home and try to edit. I
would never finish it. Okay, it's just

80
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
would never finish it. Okay, it's just
 

81
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,630
would never finish it. Okay, it's just
easier.

82
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
easier.
 

83
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,190
easier.
Put some fade in, fade out. Now I just

84
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
Put some fade in, fade out. Now I just
 

85
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,670
Put some fade in, fade out. Now I just
got to wait for it to get on on the

86
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
got to wait for it to get on on the
 

87
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,789
got to wait for it to get on on the
channel. Okay. But

88
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
channel. Okay. But
 

89
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,789
channel. Okay. But
so whatever amount of throws that you're

90
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
so whatever amount of throws that you're
 

91
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,789
so whatever amount of throws that you're
seeing, you can see that they can just

92
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
seeing, you can see that they can just
 

93
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,870
seeing, you can see that they can just
keep coming in and coming in and coming

94
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
keep coming in and coming in and coming
 

95
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,190
keep coming in and coming in and coming
in. And of course, we already did the

96
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
in. And of course, we already did the
 

97
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,870
in. And of course, we already did the
kids class and we already did the body

98
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
kids class and we already did the body
 

99
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,550
kids class and we already did the body
conditioning and we already did the

100
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
conditioning and we already did the
 

101
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,510
conditioning and we already did the
grappling and then they're doing that.

102
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
grappling and then they're doing that.
 

103
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,949
grappling and then they're doing that.
Um,

104
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959

 

105
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,190

and you could keep that in mind. It'll

106
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
and you could keep that in mind. It'll
 

107
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,350
and you could keep that in mind. It'll
look like they're getting tired.

108
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360

 

109
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,229

Now go to where was was I getting tired?

110
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
Now go to where was was I getting tired?
 

111
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,470
Now go to where was was I getting tired?
I was able to relax on the naga side but

112
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
I was able to relax on the naga side but
 

113
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,790
I was able to relax on the naga side but
on the side I was getting tired. That's

114
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
on the side I was getting tired. That's
 

115
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,630
on the side I was getting tired. That's
where I got winded four reps in and I

116
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
where I got winded four reps in and I
 

117
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,430
where I got winded four reps in and I
wanted just to stop. Okay. And it's

118
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
wanted just to stop. Okay. And it's
 

119
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,589
wanted just to stop. Okay. And it's
because this tension if you think about

120
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
because this tension if you think about
 

121
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,110
because this tension if you think about
it if I'm not doing anything I don't

122
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
it if I'm not doing anything I don't
 

123
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,070
it if I'm not doing anything I don't
have to ground at all. You have to move

124
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
have to ground at all. You have to move
 

125
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,790
have to ground at all. You have to move
my body the whole time.

126
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
my body the whole time.
 

127
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,790
my body the whole time.
Uki should be where I'm even more

128
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
Uki should be where I'm even more
 

129
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,990
Uki should be where I'm even more
relaxed. Okay. But it can't be because

130
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
relaxed. Okay. But it can't be because
 

131
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,309
relaxed. Okay. But it can't be because
UKI has more unselfing requirement

132
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
UKI has more unselfing requirement
 

133
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,070
UKI has more unselfing requirement
than even the numbers. Okay.

134
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
than even the numbers. Okay.
 

135
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,550
than even the numbers. Okay.
Because of the loss of control that I

136
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
Because of the loss of control that I
 

137
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,589
Because of the loss of control that I
feel from it. Okay. The unpredictability

138
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
feel from it. Okay. The unpredictability
 

139
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,149
feel from it. Okay. The unpredictability
all that kind of stuff.

140
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
all that kind of stuff.
 

141
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,589
all that kind of stuff.
And again you can just see the egoic

142
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
And again you can just see the egoic
 

143
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,390
And again you can just see the egoic
drive to actually want to be

144
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
drive to actually want to be
 

145
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,470
drive to actually want to be
choreographed.

146
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
choreographed.
 

147
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,670
choreographed.
Right.

148
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680

 

149
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,390

But I see view

150
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
But I see view
 

151
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,430
But I see view
as I do get that it's higher. I do

152
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
as I do get that it's higher. I do
 

153
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,430
as I do get that it's higher. I do
understand the desire in the in the

154
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
understand the desire in the in the
 

155
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,509
understand the desire in the in the
desire to show somebody the desire to

156
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
desire to show somebody the desire to
 

157
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,149
desire to show somebody the desire to
feel powerful. I get that. But there's

158
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
feel powerful. I get that. But there's
 

159
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,910
feel powerful. I get that. But there's
more

160
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
more
 

161
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,110
more
fear in the loss of control.

162
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
fear in the loss of control.
 

163
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,509
fear in the loss of control.
The egoic mind is really working

164
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
The egoic mind is really working

But the tension is a symptom

270
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
But the tension is a symptom
 

271
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,790
But the tension is a symptom
of the anxiety. Let's call it that. And

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
of the anxiety. Let's call it that. And
 

273
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,550
of the anxiety. Let's call it that. And
the anxiety is a symptom of the self.

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,590

If I don't make that selfieing

cannot be that middle ground.
 

281
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,350
cannot be that middle ground.
That's a place where I'm still working

282
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
That's a place where I'm still working

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,070
on the contestation with the voice.
And this to me is why this this style of

286
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
And this to me is why this this style of
 

287
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,909
And this to me is why this this style of
training with that structural

288
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
training with that structural
 

289
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,990
training with that structural
understanding of where everything fits

290
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
understanding of where everything fits
 

291
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,990
understanding of where everything fits
between cultivation fields and

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
between cultivation fields and
 

293
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,550
between cultivation fields and
application fields and all that kind of

294
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
application fields and all that kind of
 

295
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,350
application fields and all that kind of
stuff. This type of training can

296
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
stuff. This type of training can
 

297
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,350
stuff. This type of training can
actually work on my spiritual maturity.

298
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360

 

299
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,270

I can actually be nonviolent now.

300
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
I can actually be nonviolent now.
 

301
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,550
I can actually be nonviolent now.

and the same thing would happen even
 

307
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,990

Right now, what modern Iikido is trying
 

329
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,749
Right now, what modern Iikido is trying
to be a nonviolent tool and then you

330
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
to be a nonviolent tool and then you
 

331
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,070
to be a nonviolent tool and then you
don't have to actually work on yourself

332
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
don't have to actually work on yourself
 

333
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,749
don't have to actually work on yourself
because we're not going to actually give

334
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
because we're not going to actually give
 

335
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,310
because we're not going to actually give
you any way of working on yourself.

336
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320

 

337
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,230

But this other way

338
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240

 

339
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,190

makes training very hard.

340
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
makes training very hard.
 

341
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,070
makes training very hard.
I just want to exercise.

342
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
I just want to exercise.
 

343
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,070
I just want to exercise.
Okay.

344
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080

 

345
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,269

But this is the way that kimon can be

346
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
But this is the way that kimon can be
 

347
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,150
But this is the way that kimon can be
concentric to zen, which can be

348
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
concentric to zen, which can be
 

349
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,790
concentric to zen, which can be
concentric to karma yoga, which can be

350
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
concentric to karma yoga, which can be
 

351
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,710
concentric to karma yoga, which can be
concentric to I'm just a guy

352
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
concentric to I'm just a guy
 

353
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,870
concentric to I'm just a guy
who works the fairy at the river

354
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
who works the fairy at the river
 

355
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:14,310
who works the fairy at the river
and I'm just like the Buddha.

356
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320

 

357
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,230

Well, if that's all true, and I know

358
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
Well, if that's all true, and I know
 

359
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,590
Well, if that's all true, and I know
it's true, just like Young knows,

360
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600

 

361
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,150

it is very problematic.

362
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160

 

363
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,790

When I'm here and I'm having responses,

364
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
When I'm here and I'm having responses,
 

365
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,070
When I'm here and I'm having responses,
cannot leave. Cannot believe. Now,

366
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
cannot leave. Cannot believe. Now,
 

367
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,030
cannot leave. Cannot believe. Now,
because we are progression based and we

368
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
because we are progression based and we
 

369
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,949
because we are progression based and we
are what we are, we always kind of

370
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
are what we are, we always kind of
 

371
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,870

Keep it going.

372
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
Keep it going.
 

373
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,269
Keep it going.
Keep it going, right? But okay, try

374
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
Keep it going, right? But okay, try
 

375
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,949
Keep it going, right? But okay, try
again tomorrow. Okay, try again

376
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
again tomorrow. Okay, try again
 

377
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,750
again tomorrow. Okay, try again
tomorrow. But in you, you have to make

378
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
tomorrow. But in you, you have to make
 

379
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,750
tomorrow. But in you, you have to make
sure it's on the table of what you're

380
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
sure it's on the table of what you're
 

381
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,150
sure it's on the table of what you're
going to try not to do and what you're

382
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
going to try not to do and what you're
 

383
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,389
going to try not to do and what you're
going to try to do and not just keep

384
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
going to try to do and not just keep
 

385
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,949
going to try to do and not just keep
going down range, not just keep doing

386
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
going down range, not just keep doing
 

387
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,790
going down range, not just keep doing
that rep again like that.

388
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
that rep again like that.
 

389
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,430
that rep again like that.
In here I've mentioned we have a policy,

and now means I'm going to suffer

404
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
and now means I'm going to suffer
 

405
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,069
and now means I'm going to suffer
through everything that you're making me

through everything that you're making me
 

407
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,230
through everything that you're making me
suffer through because you refuse to do

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
suffer through because you refuse to do
 

409
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,790
suffer through because you refuse to do
this or that. But at a certain point,

410
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
this or that. But at a certain point,
 

411
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,389
this or that. But at a certain point,
you're now going to be deemed not

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
you're now going to be deemed not
 

413
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,389
you're now going to be deemed not
responding to training and then we get a

414
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
responding to training and then we get a
 

415
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,790
responding to training and then we get a
divorce on the phone. Okay?

416
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
divorce on the phone. Okay?
 

417
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,550
divorce on the phone. Okay?
But it should never reach that way. Just

418
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
But it should never reach that way. Just
 

419
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,230
But it should never reach that way. Just
like it should never be no one should

420
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
like it should never be no one should
 

421
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,949
like it should never be no one should
ever be called out by a sensei rule. You

00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
ever be called out by a sensei rule. You
 

423
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,550
ever be called out by a sensei rule. You
see, no one should that's the sensei

424
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560

rule. No one should ever do that.
Everyone should be from the inside. And

428
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
Everyone should be from the inside. And

Everyone should be from the inside. And
I felt my emotional reactivity and that

430
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
I felt my emotional reactivity and that
 

431
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,630
I felt my emotional reactivity and that
I got to get rid of that. I got to

432
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
I got to get rid of that. I got to
 

433
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,230
I got to get rid of that. I got to
figure this out. Or I felt my shoulder

434
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
figure this out. Or I felt my shoulder
 

435
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,910
figure this out. Or I felt my shoulder
tight. I got to get rid of my shoulder

436
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
tight. I got to get rid of my shoulder
 

437
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
tight. I got to get rid of my shoulder
tight. I felt my push back on them. I

00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399

 

443
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,550

Otherwise, how in the world can I ever

444
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
Otherwise, how in the world can I ever
 

445
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,750
Otherwise, how in the world can I ever
improve on on any concentric level? What

446
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
improve on on any concentric level? What
 

447
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,990
improve on on any concentric level? What
what would be what would be the metric

448
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
what would be what would be the metric
 

449
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,590
what would be what would be the metric
for

450
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
for
 

451
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,350
for
a positive transformation if I don't do

452
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
a positive transformation if I don't do
 

453
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,870
a positive transformation if I don't do
anything about what I

454
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
anything about what I
 

455
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,269
anything about what I
Okay.

456
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
Okay.
 

457
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,670
Okay.
So,

458
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680

 

459
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,590

it takes a lot of awareness, a lot of

460
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
it takes a lot of awareness, a lot of
 

461
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,910
it takes a lot of awareness, a lot of
self-observation, but yes, a lot of

462
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
self-observation, but yes, a lot of
 

463
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,710
self-observation, but yes, a lot of
discipline, yes, a lot of grit.

464
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720

 

465
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,630

And I'll tell you this, those things are

466
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
And I'll tell you this, those things are
 

467
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,550
And I'll tell you this, those things are
way more important than who your teacher

468
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
way more important than who your teacher
 

469
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,829
way more important than who your teacher
is, whatever lineage you're in. Without

470
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
is, whatever lineage you're in. Without
 

471
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,190
is, whatever lineage you're in. Without
those things, it doesn't really matter

472
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
those things, it doesn't really matter
 

473
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,670
those things, it doesn't really matter
who your teacher is. Okay? And I would

474
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
who your teacher is. Okay? And I would
 

475
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,509
who your teacher is. Okay? And I would
say, I know it seems weird, but with

476
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
say, I know it seems weird, but with
 

477
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,350
say, I know it seems weird, but with
those things, again, it doesn't matter

478
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
those things, again, it doesn't matter
 

479
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,110
those things, again, it doesn't matter
who your teacher is.

480
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
who your teacher is.
 

481
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,069
who your teacher is.
There's not really anything

482
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079

 

483
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,710

And then you have to tell them, okay,
 

547
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,269
And then you have to tell them, okay,
we're just taking advantage of the math.

548
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
we're just taking advantage of the math.

Let's hit the grinder. The grinder is a

concrete thing. Everyone feels one time
 

553
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,430
concrete thing. Everyone feels one time
slowly and then not even a second time.

554
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
slowly and then not even a second time.
 

555
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
slowly and then not even a second time.
Okay? Do you know what I mean? No,

nobody goes, no one goes like this.
 

559
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,030
nobody goes, no one goes like this.
The first time they're like this and

560
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
The first time they're like this and
 

561
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,949
The first time they're like this and
then they don't even do it anymore.

562
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
then they don't even do it anymore.
 

563
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,030

And again, you try to tell them in
 

567
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,550
And again, you try to tell them in
training, hey, I know I'm telling you,

568
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
training, hey, I know I'm telling you,
 

569
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,629
training, hey, I know I'm telling you,
you don't do that. I know I personally

570
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
you don't do that. I know I personally
 

571
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,710
you don't do that. I know I personally
know an officer who knelt down like that

572
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
know an officer who knelt down like that
 

573
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,870

blew his kneecap out and it disable.
 

575
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,150
blew his kneecap out and it disable.
Don't do it. It doesn't work in the

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't do it. It doesn't work in the
 

577
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,990
Don't do it. It doesn't work in the
street.

578
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
street.
 

579
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,389
street.
How many of you have slapped on the on

580
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
How many of you have slapped on the on
 

581
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,949
How many of you have slapped on the on
off the map? Right. Okay. Very similar,

582
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
off the map? Right. Okay. Very similar,
 

583
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,230
off the map? Right. Okay. Very similar,
right?

584
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240

 

585
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,870

It's kn even worse. Okay, just imagine

It's so weird. What? If if it's not,

590
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
It's so weird. What? If if it's not,
 

591
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,949
It's so weird. What? If if it's not,
then why do I have a padded surface at

592
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
then why do I have a padded surface at
 

593
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:46,629
then why do I have a padded surface at
all?

594
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639

 

595
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,230

The karate sisters, they don't have

596
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
The karate sisters, they don't have

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
pads. They have wood floor. It's that
 

599
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,310
pads. They have wood floor. It's that
floor like that. We train on that floor.

600
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
floor like that. We train on that floor.
 

601
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,550
floor like that. We train on that floor.
I've showed you the shi. They train on

602
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
I've showed you the shi. They train on
 

603
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,790
I've showed you the shi. They train on
the wood floor, too. They don't have any

604
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
the wood floor, too. They don't have any
 

605
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,870
the wood floor, too. They don't have any
problem thinking that was a nonviolent

606
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
problem thinking that was a nonviolent
 

607
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,790
problem thinking that was a nonviolent
because it hurts even though they're

608
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
because it hurts even though they're
 

609
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,269
because it hurts even though they're
dispersing energy. And they know how

610
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
dispersing energy. And they know how
 

611
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,870
dispersing energy. And they know how
much training went into it. And they

612
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
much training went into it. And they
 

613
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,389
much training went into it. And they
know they got selected for this

614
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
know they got selected for this
 

615
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,990
know they got selected for this
demonstration because they can hit the

616
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
demonstration because they can hit the
 

617
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,030
demonstration because they can hit the
throw without dying.

618
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040

 

619
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,629

Again, all we're doing here is just

620
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
Again, all we're doing here is just
 

621
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,790
Again, all we're doing here is just
truly asking why, why, why, how, how

622
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
truly asking why, why, why, how, how
 

623
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,710
truly asking why, why, why, how, how
how, how, all the way to the end till I

624
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
how, how, all the way to the end till I
 

625
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,030
how, how, all the way to the end till I
actually have the answer.

626
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
actually have the answer.
 

627
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,550
actually have the answer.
And the answer is the shape of an

628
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
And the answer is the shape of an
 

629
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,629
And the answer is the shape of an
experience.

630
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639

 

631
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,790

And when you do that, why, why, how,

632
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
And when you do that, why, why, how,
 

633
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,189
And when you do that, why, why, how,
how, there's no way that a non that

634
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
how, there's no way that a non that
 

635
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,189
how, there's no way that a non that
there's such a thing as a nonviolent

636
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
there's such a thing as a nonviolent
 

637
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,790
there's such a thing as a nonviolent
martial art. There's just not. And

638
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
martial art. There's just not. And
 

639
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,870
martial art. There's just not. And
there's no way that I can solve within

640
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
there's no way that I can solve within
 

641
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,430
there's no way that I can solve within
me my own propensity towards violence,

642
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
me my own propensity towards violence,
 

643
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,069
me my own propensity towards violence,
towards reactivity,

644
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
towards reactivity,
 

645
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,550
towards reactivity,
in my own will to power by giving me a

646
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
in my own will to power by giving me a
 

647
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,269
in my own will to power by giving me a
tool. There's no way.

648
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279

 

649
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,949

And we're just going, okay, now that

650
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
And we're just going, okay, now that
 

651
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,310
And we're just going, okay, now that
there's no way, how do you do it? How

652
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
there's no way, how do you do it? How
 

653
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,069
there's no way, how do you do it? How
would you actually do it if there's no

654
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
would you actually do it if there's no
 

655
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,230
would you actually do it if there's no
way?

656
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240

 

657
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,350

And now we do keep on that way.

658
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
And now we do keep on that way.
 

659
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,910

661
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,470

And one of the key places is a new

And one of the key places is a new

because that is really pushing on us the

664
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
because that is really pushing on us the
 

665
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,790
because that is really pushing on us the
loss of control

666
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800

 

667
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,550

and because we know that spiritually

668
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
and because we know that spiritually
 

669
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,670
and because we know that spiritually
that is one reason why we cannot do

670
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
that is one reason why we cannot do
 

671
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,110
that is one reason why we cannot do
this. the choreography can

672
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
this. the choreography can
 

673
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,230
this. the choreography can
cannot do it. So now we have to train

674
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
cannot do it. So now we have to train
 

675
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,069
cannot do it. So now we have to train
ourselves to be able to be thrown

676
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
ourselves to be able to be thrown
 

677
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,749
ourselves to be able to be thrown
safely.

678
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759

our will to retreat.
 

695
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,710
our will to retreat.
We're that's on the table. Now,

696
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720

Charlie was a little kid that was

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
Charlie was a little kid that was
 

703
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:39,029
Charlie was a little kid that was
playing games.

sometimes too

706
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280

 

707
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,190

in my will to stay in control

708
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
in my will to stay in control
 

709
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,630
in my will to stay in control
and the fear that's behind it.

710
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
and the fear that's behind it.
 

711
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,890
and the fear that's behind it.
I mask it with the morality.

712
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:52,900
I mask it with the morality.
 

713
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,789
I mask it with the morality.

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,909

But we went deeper

722
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
happens. But from various cultures, this
 

817
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,390
happens. But from various cultures, this
discussion Sounds like an argument.

818
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
discussion Sounds like an argument.
 

819
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,350
discussion Sounds like an argument.
Okay. But from my culture, everyone

820
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay. But from my culture, everyone
 

821
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,510
Okay. But from my culture, everyone
talks at once. And if you want to be

822
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
talks at once. And if you want to be
 

823
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,870
talks at once. And if you want to be
hurt, you're going to have to raise your

824
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
hurt, you're going to have to raise your
 

825
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,590
hurt, you're going to have to raise your
volume up. Otherwise, you can't be hurt.

826
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
volume up. Otherwise, you can't be hurt.
 

827
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,270
volume up. Otherwise, you can't be hurt.
And right. And I'm not even paying

828
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
And right. And I'm not even paying
 

829
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,990
And right. And I'm not even paying
attention cuz no one is fighting.

830
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000

 

831
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,190

She ends up leaving the table crying and

832
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
She ends up leaving the table crying and
 

833
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,669
She ends up leaving the table crying and
goes into the bathroom.

834
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
goes into the bathroom.
 

835
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,750
goes into the bathroom.
And I'm I'm like I'm not even paying

836
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
And I'm I'm like I'm not even paying
 

837
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,310
And I'm I'm like I'm not even paying
attention. And my mom is saying to me,

838
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
attention. And my mom is saying to me,
 

839
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,669
attention. And my mom is saying to me,
she goes, "Where's she go? Where's she

840
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
she goes, "Where's she go? Where's she
 

841
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,950
she goes, "Where's she go? Where's she
going? Where's she going?" I go, "I

842
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
going? Where's she going?" I go, "I
 

843
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,430
going? Where's she going?" I go, "I
don't know. To the bathroom."

844
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
don't know. To the bathroom."
 

845
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,870
don't know. To the bathroom."
And then my mom goes,

846
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
And then my mom goes,
 

847
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,549
And then my mom goes,
"Go see if she's throwing up

848
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
"Go see if she's throwing up
 

849
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,110
"Go see if she's throwing up
cuz Mary was really skinny.

850
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120

 

851
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,029

I think she's throwing up the dinner.

852
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
I think she's throwing up the dinner.
 

853
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,270
I think she's throwing up the dinner.
She's too skinny." And I I got to go cuz

854
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
She's too skinny." And I I got to go cuz
 

855
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,110
She's too skinny." And I I got to go cuz
she's not going to let me talk anymore.

856
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
she's not going to let me talk anymore.
 

857
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,270
she's not going to let me talk anymore.
And I go, Hey, are you all right? And

858
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
And I go, Hey, are you all right? And
 

859
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,270
And I go, Hey, are you all right? And
she's crying, "No, everyone's mad and

860
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
she's crying, "No, everyone's mad and
 

861
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,750
she's crying, "No, everyone's mad and
everyone's fighting." No, no, no one's

862
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
everyone's fighting." No, no, no one's
 

863
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,230
everyone's fighting." No, no, no one's
fighting. Okay, no one's fighting

864
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240

 

865
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,950

now. She just she jumps in. Okay, it's

866
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
now. She just she jumps in. Okay, it's
 

867
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,590
now. She just she jumps in. Okay, it's
fine. Now she talks too loud for her

868
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
fine. Now she talks too loud for her
 

869
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:12,950
fine. Now she talks too loud for her
family. In fact,

870
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960

 

871
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,590

so

872
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600

 

873
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,230

here we are. We're getting to know each

874
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
here we are. We're getting to know each
 

875
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,070
here we are. We're getting to know each
other, right? You have kids. And then it

876
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
other, right? You have kids. And then it
 

877
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,470
other, right? You have kids. And then it
actually brings more self

878
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480

 

879
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,230

unself because now the kids too need the

880
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
unself because now the kids too need the
 

881
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,950
unself because now the kids too need the
sacrificing of self. You need to serve.

882
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
sacrificing of self. You need to serve.
 

883
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,909
sacrificing of self. You need to serve.
You have your karma yoga here.

884
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
You have your karma yoga here.
 

885
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,590
You have your karma yoga here.
You're tired. Doesn't matter. You're

886
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
You're tired. Doesn't matter. You're
 

887
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,190
You're tired. Doesn't matter. You're
tired.

888
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
tired.
 

889
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,870
tired.
You're sick. It doesn't matter if you're

890
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
You're sick. It doesn't matter if you're
 

891
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,430
You're sick. It doesn't matter if you're
sick.

892
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
sick.
 

893
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,830
sick.
You have to serve.

894
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840

 

895
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,149

I can't carry this because this has to

896
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
I can't carry this because this has to
 

897
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,430
I can't carry this because this has to
be carried.

898
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440

 

899
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,750

If you didn't unself, you would be going

900
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
If you didn't unself, you would be going
 

901
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,630
If you didn't unself, you would be going
and saying to yourself, I deserve this

902
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
and saying to yourself, I deserve this
 

903
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,470
and saying to yourself, I deserve this
rest.

904
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
rest.
 

905
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,710
rest.
But to take that rest now, this person

906
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
But to take that rest now, this person
 

907
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,630
But to take that rest now, this person
can't

908
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
can't
 

909
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,750
can't
be helped.

910
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
be helped.
 

911
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:20,549
be helped.
To me, that's a worse kind of violence.

912
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559

 

913
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,590

And when you look at this child who you

914
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
And when you look at this child who you
 

915
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,669
And when you look at this child who you
were resting or you were entertaining

916
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
were resting or you were entertaining
 

917
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,909
were resting or you were entertaining
yourself or you were having ladies night

918
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
yourself or you were having ladies night
 

919
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,630
yourself or you were having ladies night
or what have you

920
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
or what have you
 

921
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,710
or what have you
cuz you needed distraction from this

922
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
cuz you needed distraction from this
 

923
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,909
cuz you needed distraction from this
world, we already know.

924
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
world, we already know.
 

925
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,470
world, we already know.
We already know the science is in. We

926
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
We already know the science is in. We
 

927
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,070
We already know the science is in. We
already know that child has been hurt

928
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
already know that child has been hurt
 

929
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,110
already know that child has been hurt
damaged and I never laid a hand on

930
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120

 

931
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,029

Where is that violence? What's the

932
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
Where is that violence? What's the
 

933
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,029
Where is that violence? What's the
source of that violence? I would say

934
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
source of that violence? I would say
 

935
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,870
source of that violence? I would say
it's a worse violence.

936
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880

 

937
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,630

It's a worse violence because we get

938
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
It's a worse violence because we get
 

939
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,390
It's a worse violence because we get
away with it. Because culturally we've

940
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
away with it. Because culturally we've
 

941
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,230
away with it. Because culturally we've
accepted it.

942
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240

 

943
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,870

Somehow physical violence made some

944
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
Somehow physical violence made some
 

945
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,669
Somehow physical violence made some
difference.

946
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679

 

947
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,789

And so we do violence as I understand it

948
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
And so we do violence as I understand it
 

949
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,789
And so we do violence as I understand it
and I'm telling you about it now. We do

950
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
and I'm telling you about it now. We do
 

951
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,669
and I'm telling you about it now. We do
it all the time. It just there's no

952
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
it all the time. It just there's no
 

953
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,390
it all the time. It just there's no
moral code against it. Now we do it more

954
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
moral code against it. Now we do it more
 

955
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,870
moral code against it. Now we do it more
freely. But it's worse.

956
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
freely. But it's worse.
 

957
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,750
freely. But it's worse.
It's worse. It's worse cuz there's no

958
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
It's worse. It's worse cuz there's no
 

959
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,070
It's worse. It's worse cuz there's no
moral code against it.

960
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080

 

961
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,230

So it's not enough if I just say to

962
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
So it's not enough if I just say to
 

963
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,029
So it's not enough if I just say to
myself, I would never hurt hit someone.

964
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
myself, I would never hurt hit someone.
 

965
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,070
myself, I would never hurt hit someone.
It's not enough. It's not enough. It's

966
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
It's not enough. It's not enough. It's
 

967
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,789
It's not enough. It's not enough. It's
nowhere near enough.

968
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
nowhere near enough.
 

969
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,390
nowhere near enough.
And if you remember

970
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
And if you remember
 

971
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,390
And if you remember
this is only for this part of the

972
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
this is only for this part of the
 

973
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,750
this is only for this part of the
training.

974
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760

 

975
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,430

You try that at this part. You try

976
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
You try that at this part. You try
 

977
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,750
You try that at this part. You try
to say I'm following the earthly laws

978
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
he says, "Thanks for not killing me.
 

1143
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,350
he says, "Thanks for not killing me.
I knew you could have you probably

1144
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
I knew you could have you probably
 

1145
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,269
I knew you could have you probably
should have."

1146
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279

 

1147
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,630

Okay, that's nonviolent. Amish violence.

1148
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
Okay, that's nonviolent. Amish violence.
 

1149
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,830
Okay, that's nonviolent. Amish violence.
That's true. nonviolence.

1150
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
That's true. nonviolence.
 

1151
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,990
That's true. nonviolence.
Wrapping myself in a moral code or

1152
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
Wrapping myself in a moral code or
 

1153
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,870
Wrapping myself in a moral code or
wrapping myself in some art, that's not

1154
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
wrapping myself in some art, that's not
 

1155
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,310
wrapping myself in some art, that's not
nonviolence.

1156
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320

 

1157
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,029

So for all these reasons, I really have

1158
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
So for all these reasons, I really have
 

1159
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,070
So for all these reasons, I really have
to pay attention to my fear on the mat,

1160
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
to pay attention to my fear on the mat,
 

1161
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,230
to pay attention to my fear on the mat,
myself being on the mat, even when I

1162
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
myself being on the mat, even when I
 

1163
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,789
myself being on the mat, even when I
mask it with some moral

1164
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:38,799
mask it with some moral
 

1165
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,510
mask it with some moral
thing, you see, some worldly code like

1166
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
thing, you see, some worldly code like
 

1167
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,350
thing, you see, some worldly code like
it's nonviolent. I'm being nonviolent. I

1168
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
it's nonviolent. I'm being nonviolent. I
 

1169
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,950
it's nonviolent. I'm being nonviolent. I
never hit someone.

1170
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
never hit someone.
 

1171
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,350
never hit someone.
I would never.

1172
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
I would never.
 

1173
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,669
I would never.
And instead understand it just as my own

1174
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
And instead understand it just as my own
 

1175
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,430
And instead understand it just as my own
humanity.

1176
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
humanity.
 

1177
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,310
humanity.
There's a part of me

1178
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
There's a part of me
 

1179
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,669
There's a part of me
that wants and needs power, wants and

1180
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
that wants and needs power, wants and
 

1181
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,149
that wants and needs power, wants and
needs control.

1182
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
needs control.
 

1183
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,830
needs control.
But there's another part of me that

1184
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
But there's another part of me that
 

1185
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,350
But there's another part of me that
doesn't want nor need power or control.

1186
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360

 

1187
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,789

And to understand that it's a skill

1188
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
And to understand that it's a skill
 

1189
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,110
And to understand that it's a skill
that it's not a state I reach. It's a

1190
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,120
that it's not a state I reach. It's a
 

1191
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,510
that it's not a state I reach. It's a
skill I have. A skill in what? A skill

1192
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,520
skill I have. A skill in what? A skill
 

1193
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,470
skill I have. A skill in what? A skill
in unself.

1194
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480

 

1195
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,710

And so as a skill and unself, I practice

1196
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
And so as a skill and unself, I practice
 

1197
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,029
And so as a skill and unself, I practice
it over and over. I do the training

1198
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
it over and over. I do the training
 

1199
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,190
it over and over. I do the training
equations over and over and over and

1200
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
equations over and over and over and
 

1201
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,630
equations over and over and over and
over every day.

1202
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640

 

1203
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,830

So I had I felt the fear. I felt the

1204
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
So I had I felt the fear. I felt the
 

1205
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,029
So I had I felt the fear. I felt the
tension. I do the death meditation and I

1206
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
tension. I do the death meditation and I
 

1207
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,789
tension. I do the death meditation and I
just accept what's happening. All I got

1208
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
just accept what's happening. All I got
 

1209
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,110
just accept what's happening. All I got
to do is not let my head hit the mat.

1210
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
to do is not let my head hit the mat.
 

1211
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,590
to do is not let my head hit the mat.
I'm going to be okay.

1212
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
I'm going to be okay.
 

1213
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,029
I'm going to be okay.
Accept. Feel them. Feel the force.

1214
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
Accept. Feel them. Feel the force.
 

1215
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,630
Accept. Feel them. Feel the force.
Except

1216
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
Except
 

1217
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,269
Except
same thing as no.

1218
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
same thing as no.
 

1219
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,630
same thing as no.
Stop. Stop.

1220
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
Stop. Stop.
 

1221
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,310
Stop. Stop.
Stop the training. Go back and do it.

1222
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
Stop the training. Go back and do it.
 

1223
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,909
Stop the training. Go back and do it.
Don't go into pasti state cuz that's

1224
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
Don't go into pasti state cuz that's
 

1225
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,630
Don't go into pasti state cuz that's
that worldly dressing. He's saying

1226
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
that worldly dressing. He's saying
 

1227
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:18,870
that worldly dressing. He's saying
that's not it either.

1228
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880

 

1229
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,430

In a way, the weird way

1230
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440

 

1231
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,389

the reconcili reconciliation of our will

1232
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
the reconcili reconciliation of our will
 

1233
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,190
the reconcili reconciliation of our will
to power allows for power without the

1234
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
to power allows for power without the
 

1235
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,549
to power allows for power without the
will to power. It's very strange.

1236
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
will to power. It's very strange.
 

1237
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,710
will to power. It's very strange.
So the technique both feels soft and

1238
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
So the technique both feels soft and
 

1239
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,870
So the technique both feels soft and
hard,

1240
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
hard,
 

1241
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,590
hard,
strong and weak both feels that way.

1242
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
strong and weak both feels that way.
 

1243
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,750
strong and weak both feels that way.
Fast and slow, you see, because it's

1244
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
Fast and slow, you see, because it's
 

1245
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,549
Fast and slow, you see, because it's
reconciling the dichotoies. And so it

1246
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
reconciling the dichotoies. And so it
 

1247
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,149
reconciling the dichotoies. And so it
does feel powerful and effortless,

1248
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159

 

1249
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,470

not powerful and effortful.

1250
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480

 

1251
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,310

But I have to be the one to reel me in.

1252
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
But I have to be the one to reel me in.
 

1253
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,789
But I have to be the one to reel me in.
I got to reel me in. And here that's the

1254
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
I got to reel me in. And here that's the
 

1255
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,710
I got to reel me in. And here that's the
expectation.

1256
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
expectation.
 

1257
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,430
expectation.
I don't care how

1258
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
I don't care how
 

1259
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,149
I don't care how
slow you go, how many times you start

1260
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
slow you go, how many times you start
 

1261
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,110
slow you go, how many times you start
over. That's going to keep us in better

1262
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
over. That's going to keep us in better
 

1263
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,830
over. That's going to keep us in better
graces. And if you're just unconsciously

1264
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
graces. And if you're just unconsciously
 

1265
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,710
graces. And if you're just unconsciously
practicing selfing or you're

1266
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
practicing selfing or you're
 

1267
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,350
practicing selfing or you're
unconsciously masking

1268
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360

 

1269
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,590

your lack of power with the moral code,

1270
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
your lack of power with the moral code,
 

1271
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,070
your lack of power with the moral code,
you see

1272
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,080
you see
 

1273
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,029
you see
this is also not what we do. And I think

1274
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
this is also not what we do. And I think
 

1275
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,149
this is also not what we do. And I think
the best place to do it is student

1276
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
the best place to do it is student
 

1277
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,799
the best place to do it is student
because it's so
