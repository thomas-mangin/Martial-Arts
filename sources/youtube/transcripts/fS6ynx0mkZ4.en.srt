00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,040
detail sub you shouldn't that check it
out otherwise this is a knife system and

42
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,050
out otherwise this is a knife system and
 

43
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,420

hopefully will be useful to you guys
 

47
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,170
hopefully will be useful to you guys
thanks a lot alright so first part of

48
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,180
thanks a lot alright so first part of
 

49
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,029
thanks a lot alright so first part of
hinds knife theory is you have to

50
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
hinds knife theory is you have to
 

51
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,680
hinds knife theory is you have to
understand there's no such thing as a

52
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:54,690
understand there's no such thing as a
 

53
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,990
understand there's no such thing as a
knife fight and that's a little bit of

54
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
knife fight and that's a little bit of
 

55
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
knife fight and that's a little bit of
provocative language purposefully but

56
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,010
provocative language purposefully but
 

57
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,439
provocative language purposefully but
the basic idea behind that and I'm not

58
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:00,449
the basic idea behind that and I'm not
 

59
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,060
the basic idea behind that and I'm not
saying that you know historically people

60
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,070
saying that you know historically people
 

61
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,410
saying that you know historically people
haven't gotten in fights with knives

62
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,420
haven't gotten in fights with knives
 

63
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,810
haven't gotten in fights with knives
certainly they have but what you think

64
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,820
certainly they have but what you think
 

65
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,460
certainly they have but what you think
of as being a fight where two people are

66
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:07,470
of as being a fight where two people are
 

67
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,950
of as being a fight where two people are
exchanging and they're able to control

68
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,960
exchanging and they're able to control
 

69
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,410
exchanging and they're able to control
the power the other person's making that

70
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,420
the power the other person's making that
 

71
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,480
the power the other person's making that
doesn't really exist with knives

72
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,490
doesn't really exist with knives
 

73
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,850
doesn't really exist with knives
and the reason is kind of simple so if

74
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
and the reason is kind of simple so if
 

75
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,190
and the reason is kind of simple so if
we were in a fist fight so me and Josh

76
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
we were in a fist fight so me and Josh
 

77
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,010
we were in a fist fight so me and Josh
here we were in a fist fight then

78
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,020
here we were in a fist fight then
 

79
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,710
here we were in a fist fight then
basically what we have the same distance

80
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
basically what we have the same distance
 

81
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,690
basically what we have the same distance
so meaning when josh is able to hit me

82
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
so meaning when josh is able to hit me
 

83
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,270
so meaning when josh is able to hit me
I'm able to hit him back now because

84
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
I'm able to hit him back now because
 

85
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm able to hit him back now because
josh has the ability with his body to

86
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:31,710
josh has the ability with his body to
 

87
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,670
josh has the ability with his body to
cover then he can eliminate my ability

88
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:34,680
cover then he can eliminate my ability
 

89
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,410
cover then he can eliminate my ability
to hit him back with as much power as he

90
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
to hit him back with as much power as he
 

91
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,420
to hit him back with as much power as he
hits me so for example Josh let it hit

92
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,430
hits me so for example Josh let it hit
 

93
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,730
hits me so for example Josh let it hit
me and I hit him back he can cover and

94
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:40,740
me and I hit him back he can cover and
 

95
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,649
me and I hit him back he can cover and
defend against that shot right so if he

96
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:42,659
defend against that shot right so if he
 

97
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,510
defend against that shot right so if he
does a high cover from this bang he can

98
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
does a high cover from this bang he can
 

99
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,100
does a high cover from this bang he can
protect himself from me hitting him as

100
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,110
protect himself from me hitting him as
 

101
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,200
protect himself from me hitting him as
hard as he's getting me and so if this

102
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,210
hard as he's getting me and so if this
 

103
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,999
hard as he's getting me and so if this
fight consists of two people moving

104
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:50,009
fight consists of two people moving
 

105
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,830
fight consists of two people moving
around and both trying to hit each other

106
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
around and both trying to hit each other
 

107
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
around and both trying to hit each other
and the

108
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,170
and the
 

109
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,899
and the
he's making the contact doing it in a

110
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:54,909
he's making the contact doing it in a
 

111
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,520
he's making the contact doing it in a
way that the other person can't hit him

112
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,530
way that the other person can't hit him
 

113
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,469
way that the other person can't hit him
back his heart right so I could take

114
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
back his heart right so I could take
 

115
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,780
back his heart right so I could take
clever angles and hit him so it can't

116
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:00,790
clever angles and hit him so it can't
 

117
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,880
clever angles and hit him so it can't
hit me as hard and I can also covering

118
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:02,890
hit me as hard and I can also covering
 

119
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,320
hit me as hard and I can also covering
covering seem to be a really important

120
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,330
covering seem to be a really important
 

121
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,910
covering seem to be a really important
skill especially when we're in distance

122
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
skill especially when we're in distance
 

123
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
skill especially when we're in distance
because of the the speed of the hands

124
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:07,930
because of the the speed of the hands
 

125
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,969
because of the the speed of the hands
and the speed of the feet we're gonna

126
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:08,979
and the speed of the feet we're gonna
 

127
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,559
and the speed of the feet we're gonna
talk about that in a later video but

128
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:10,569
talk about that in a later video but
 

129
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,809
talk about that in a later video but
that's basically how a fistfight would

130
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:12,819
that's basically how a fistfight would
 

131
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,080
that's basically how a fistfight would
work we can exchange blows because we're

132
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,090
work we can exchange blows because we're
 

133
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,390
work we can exchange blows because we're
able to neutralize the other person's

134
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
able to neutralize the other person's
 

135
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,670
able to neutralize the other person's
blows in a certain way now if we were

136
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:20,680
blows in a certain way now if we were
 

137
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,970
blows in a certain way now if we were
doing a sword fight right so a sword

138
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:23,980
doing a sword fight right so a sword
 

139
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,770
doing a sword fight right so a sword
fight we can do the same kind of thing

140
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:25,780
fight we can do the same kind of thing
 

141
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,470
fight we can do the same kind of thing
because in a sword fight I can use the

142
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
because in a sword fight I can use the
 

143
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,660
because in a sword fight I can use the
sword to create what's called opposition

144
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,670
sword to create what's called opposition
 

145
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,670
sword to create what's called opposition
so meaning because Josh and I have the

146
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
so meaning because Josh and I have the
 

147
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,949
so meaning because Josh and I have the
same reach right meaning if Josh attacks

148
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
same reach right meaning if Josh attacks
 

149
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,870
same reach right meaning if Josh attacks
me I can attack job right and this

150
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:36,880
me I can attack job right and this
 

151
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,580
me I can attack job right and this
course would be a stupid way of using a

152
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,590
course would be a stupid way of using a
 

153
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,900
course would be a stupid way of using a
sword you wouldn't call it a fight you

154
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:39,910
sword you wouldn't call it a fight you
 

155
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,979
sword you wouldn't call it a fight you
can tell it to people murdering each

156
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:40,989
can tell it to people murdering each
 

157
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,199
can tell it to people murdering each
other so I said Josh Josh that's me bad

158
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,209
other so I said Josh Josh that's me bad
 

159
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:43,770
other so I said Josh Josh that's me bad
idea

160
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:43,780
idea
 

161
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,960
idea
so what I want to be able to do is make

162
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:45,970
so what I want to be able to do is make
 

163
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,059
so what I want to be able to do is make
attacks on Josh that give me natural

164
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:48,069
attacks on Josh that give me natural
 

165
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,039
attacks on Josh that give me natural
opposition meaning when I'm attacking

166
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,049
opposition meaning when I'm attacking
 

167
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,990
opposition meaning when I'm attacking
this guy his immediate response is

168
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
this guy his immediate response is
 

169
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,910
this guy his immediate response is
covered by my sword now because of the

170
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
covered by my sword now because of the
 

171
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,170
covered by my sword now because of the
length of my sword

172
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,180
length of my sword
 

173
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,509
length of my sword
I'm able to naturally oppose it now from

174
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
I'm able to naturally oppose it now from
 

175
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,069
I'm able to naturally oppose it now from
this line here you can see even if Josh

176
00:02:59,069 --> 00:02:59,079
this line here you can see even if Josh
 

177
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,930
this line here you can see even if Josh
was under my sword he misses me while

178
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:00,940
was under my sword he misses me while
 

179
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,810
was under my sword he misses me while
I'm attacking him so I've created a way

180
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm attacking him so I've created a way
 

181
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,420
I'm attacking him so I've created a way
to oppose his sword with the length of

182
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,430
to oppose his sword with the length of
 

183
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,520
to oppose his sword with the length of
my sword and the angles I'm taking to

184
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,530
my sword and the angles I'm taking to
 

185
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,580
my sword and the angles I'm taking to
keep him from returning that blow now if

186
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:11,590
keep him from returning that blow now if
 

187
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,610
keep him from returning that blow now if
we both had knives we can't do the same

188
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:14,620
we both had knives we can't do the same
 

189
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,770
we both had knives we can't do the same
thing because our bodies aren't strong

190
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:16,780
thing because our bodies aren't strong
 

191
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,660
thing because our bodies aren't strong
enough to resist the knife so in the

192
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,670
enough to resist the knife so in the
 

193
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,090
enough to resist the knife so in the
fist fighting scenario when Josh hits me

194
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,100
fist fighting scenario when Josh hits me
 

195
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,640
fist fighting scenario when Josh hits me
and I return a shot he can cover to keep

196
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650
and I return a shot he can cover to keep
 

197
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,830
and I return a shot he can cover to keep
me from hitting him as hard so we can't

198
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
me from hitting him as hard so we can't
 

199
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,270
me from hitting him as hard so we can't
do that with knives because every time I

200
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
do that with knives because every time I
 

201
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,340
do that with knives because every time I
stab him it's gonna be really bad and

202
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,350
stab him it's gonna be really bad and
 

203
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,990
stab him it's gonna be really bad and
returned now he might get me worse but

204
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,000
returned now he might get me worse but
 

205
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
returned now he might get me worse but
he's still gonna suffer a bad blow

206
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,410
he's still gonna suffer a bad blow
 

207
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,140
he's still gonna suffer a bad blow
potentially a fatal blow so we can't

208
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,150
potentially a fatal blow so we can't
 

209
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,240
potentially a fatal blow so we can't
trade at all like we could in a fist

210
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,250
trade at all like we could in a fist
 

211
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,180
trade at all like we could in a fist
fight with swords I can use the length

212
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,190
fight with swords I can use the length
 

213
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,979
fight with swords I can use the length
of the weapon so we can't trade because

214
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:40,989
of the weapon so we can't trade because
 

215
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,870
of the weapon so we can't trade because
the weapons are powerful but I can use

216
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:42,880
the weapons are powerful but I can use
 

217
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,610
the weapons are powerful but I can use
the length of the weapon to oppose his

218
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:44,620
the length of the weapon to oppose his
 

219
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,259
the length of the weapon to oppose his
weapons with a knife because the weapons

220
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:46,269
weapons with a knife because the weapons
 

221
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,750
weapons with a knife because the weapons
so short I can't really oppose his knife

222
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,760
so short I can't really oppose his knife
 

223
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,670
so short I can't really oppose his knife
if we're inside range with the night she

224
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
if we're inside range with the night she
 

225
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,390
if we're inside range with the night she
can always return cut me so knives don't

226
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
can always return cut me so knives don't
 

227
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,940
can always return cut me so knives don't
really have a fight in the same sense

228
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:56,950
really have a fight in the same sense
 

229
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,710
really have a fight in the same sense
that this fight would or a sword fight

230
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
that this fight would or a sword fight
 

231
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,070
that this fight would or a sword fight
would there could be two people in a

232
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
would there could be two people in a
 

233
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,089
would there could be two people in a
struggle one person's are

234
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:04,099
struggle one person's are
 

235
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,289
struggle one person's are
with a knife and we wouldn't say to have

236
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:05,299
with a knife and we wouldn't say to have
 

237
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,550
with a knife and we wouldn't say to have
any knife fight then we're saying the

238
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
any knife fight then we're saying the
 

239
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,289
any knife fight then we're saying the
person who has the knife right so if I

240
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:08,299
person who has the knife right so if I
 

241
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,809
person who has the knife right so if I
had a knife I would be stabbing Josh

242
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:10,819
had a knife I would be stabbing Josh
 

243
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,640
had a knife I would be stabbing Josh
with a knife we're not in a knife fight

244
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,650
with a knife we're not in a knife fight
 

245
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,170
with a knife we're not in a knife fight
we're in a fight where I'm stabbing Josh

246
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,180
we're in a fight where I'm stabbing Josh
 

247
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,729
we're in a fight where I'm stabbing Josh
vice-versa so be the same with peek at a

248
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:15,739
vice-versa so be the same with peek at a
 

249
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,009
vice-versa so be the same with peek at a
knife in return if Josh had a knife that

250
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:18,019
knife in return if Josh had a knife that
 

251
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,199
knife in return if Josh had a knife that
I had a knife we could be fighting with

252
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,209
I had a knife we could be fighting with
 

253
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,819
I had a knife we could be fighting with
it but the truth is really we're

254
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:21,829
it but the truth is really we're
 

255
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,290
it but the truth is really we're
murdering each other is what we're doing

256
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,300
murdering each other is what we're doing
 

257
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,360
murdering each other is what we're doing
so we can't provide enough opposition we

258
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,370
so we can't provide enough opposition we
 

259
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,680
so we can't provide enough opposition we
can't neutralize the other person's

260
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:26,690
can't neutralize the other person's
 

261
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,870
can't neutralize the other person's
attack so much to make it beneficial to

262
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
attack so much to make it beneficial to
 

263
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,029
attack so much to make it beneficial to
get into that kind of engagement so the

264
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:31,039
get into that kind of engagement so the
 

265
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,200
get into that kind of engagement so the
first thing you got to understand is

266
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,210
first thing you got to understand is
 

267
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,730
first thing you got to understand is
that knife fights really don't exist

268
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:33,740
that knife fights really don't exist
 

269
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,290
that knife fights really don't exist
it's just kind of murdering each other

270
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,300
it's just kind of murdering each other
 

271
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,029
it's just kind of murdering each other
with knives if you get out of the knife

272
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,039
with knives if you get out of the knife
 

273
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,249
with knives if you get out of the knife
bite without getting cut severely then

274
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:39,259
bite without getting cut severely then
 

275
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,080
bite without getting cut severely then
you got lucky but in general you

276
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,090
you got lucky but in general you
 

277
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,969
you got lucky but in general you
couldn't make a continuous system that

278
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:42,979
couldn't make a continuous system that
 

279
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,490
couldn't make a continuous system that
protects you all the time when there's

280
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,500
protects you all the time when there's
 

281
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,320
protects you all the time when there's
knives involved in both of your your

282
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,330
knives involved in both of your your
 

283
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,629
knives involved in both of your your
hands so knife fights don't exist that's

284
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:49,639
hands so knife fights don't exist that's
 

285
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,610
hands so knife fights don't exist that's
the first part of the theory stay tuned

286
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,620
the first part of the theory stay tuned
 

287
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,740
the first part of the theory stay tuned
for the next which is the hands quicker

288
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,750
for the next which is the hands quicker
 

289
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,960
for the next which is the hands quicker
than the foot all right second part of

290
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:55,970
than the foot all right second part of
 

291
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,540
than the foot all right second part of
hinds knife theory so the first part was

292
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,550
hinds knife theory so the first part was
 

293
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,219
hinds knife theory so the first part was
talking about how knife fights don't

294
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:00,229
talking about how knife fights don't
 

295
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,140
talking about how knife fights don't
exist because we don't have the ability

296
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,150
exist because we don't have the ability
 

297
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,300
exist because we don't have the ability
to create opposition we don't bility to

298
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,310
to create opposition we don't bility to
 

299
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,339
to create opposition we don't bility to
defend ourselves at that range very

300
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:06,349
defend ourselves at that range very
 

301
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,900
defend ourselves at that range very
nicely from their weapon I can't take

302
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:07,910
nicely from their weapon I can't take
 

303
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,149
nicely from their weapon I can't take
really nice lines and my body's not

304
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:10,159
really nice lines and my body's not
 

305
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,620
really nice lines and my body's not
strong enough to resist the knife so I

306
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:11,630
strong enough to resist the knife so I
 

307
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,450
strong enough to resist the knife so I
can't really oppose his weapon that way

308
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:13,460
can't really oppose his weapon that way
 

309
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,969
can't really oppose his weapon that way
this part is a game that you need to

310
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:15,979
this part is a game that you need to
 

311
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,310
this part is a game that you need to
play and so this basically will

312
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
play and so this basically will
 

313
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,890
play and so this basically will
illustrate how important hand versus

314
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:20,900
illustrate how important hand versus
 

315
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,950
illustrate how important hand versus
foot speed is and this will also tell us

316
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:23,960
foot speed is and this will also tell us
 

317
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,159
foot speed is and this will also tell us
what the ranges of the knife are and

318
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:27,169
what the ranges of the knife are and
 

319
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,200
what the ranges of the knife are and
there's basically in range and out of

320
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,210
there's basically in range and out of
 

321
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,180
there's basically in range and out of
range with the knife and those are two

322
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,190
range with the knife and those are two
 

323
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,520
range with the knife and those are two
really important ranges to understand so

324
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,530
really important ranges to understand so
 

325
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,170
really important ranges to understand so
the first game you're gonna play is

326
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,180
the first game you're gonna play is

you're gonna get with your partner and a
fingertip distance just like this you're

330
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,810
fingertip distance just like this you're
 

331
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,749
fingertip distance just like this you're
both gonna stand square I have a rubber

332
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:40,759
both gonna stand square I have a rubber
 

333
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,520
both gonna stand square I have a rubber
training knife okay

334
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,530
training knife okay
 

335
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,040
training knife okay
now whatever length of the knife you

336
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,050
now whatever length of the knife you
 

337
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,230
now whatever length of the knife you
have you have to include that in this

338
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,240
have you have to include that in this
 

339
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,930
have you have to include that in this
minimum safety distance so I have a six

340
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:49,940
minimum safety distance so I have a six
 

341
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,920
minimum safety distance so I have a six
inch knife that's gonna give me a

342
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:50,930
inch knife that's gonna give me a
 

343
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,209
inch knife that's gonna give me a
six-inch reach so we're gonna go ahead

344
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:52,219
six-inch reach so we're gonna go ahead
 

345
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,189
six-inch reach so we're gonna go ahead
and adjust for that now and if I'm

346
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199
and adjust for that now and if I'm
 

347
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,140
and adjust for that now and if I'm
including a knife we're also gonna have

348
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,150
including a knife we're also gonna have
 

349
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,700
including a knife we're also gonna have
to account for that in the range what

350
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:57,710
to account for that in the range what
 

351
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,870
to account for that in the range what
josh is going to do is he's gonna put

352
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
josh is going to do is he's gonna put
 

353
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,060
josh is going to do is he's gonna put
both of his arms behind his back this

354
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,070
both of his arms behind his back this
 

355
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,770
both of his arms behind his back this
way he has no ability to defend himself

356
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:02,780
way he has no ability to defend himself
 

357
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,180
way he has no ability to defend himself
with his arms just keeping his arms

358
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,190
with his arms just keeping his arms
 

359
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,070
with his arms just keeping his arms
behind his back what I'm gonna do is

360
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
behind his back what I'm gonna do is
 

361
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,050
behind his back what I'm gonna do is
lunge forward as fast as I can and make

362
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,060
lunge forward as fast as I can and make
 

363
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,749
lunge forward as fast as I can and make
a cut or stab on Josh okay so we'll do

364
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:10,759
a cut or stab on Josh okay so we'll do
 

365
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:19,519
a cut or stab on Josh okay so we'll do
this a couple times you can see

366
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:19,529

 

367
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,729

okay so real simple idea we're getting

368
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:23,739
okay so real simple idea we're getting
 

369
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:25,829
okay so real simple idea we're getting
square standing square and we're seeing

370
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:25,839
square standing square and we're seeing
 

371
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,019
square standing square and we're seeing
what happens when I try to cover that

372
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:28,029
what happens when I try to cover that
 

373
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,629
what happens when I try to cover that
amount of distance and he sees what's

374
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
amount of distance and he sees what's
 

375
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,299
amount of distance and he sees what's
going on right so so what's happening is

376
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:33,309
going on right so so what's happening is
 

377
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,219
going on right so so what's happening is
basically I have to move my body in

378
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:35,229
basically I have to move my body in
 

379
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,109
basically I have to move my body in
because from this distance I cannot

380
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:37,119
because from this distance I cannot
 

381
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,269
because from this distance I cannot
possibly cut him without taking a step

382
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:39,279
possibly cut him without taking a step
 

383
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,729
possibly cut him without taking a step
which means I have to use my feet to

384
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:41,739
which means I have to use my feet to
 

385
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,639
which means I have to use my feet to
move my body forward now when I do that

386
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:44,649
move my body forward now when I do that
 

387
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,009
move my body forward now when I do that
he's approximating the same speed as I

388
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:47,019
he's approximating the same speed as I
 

389
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,869
he's approximating the same speed as I
am so he'll have to move his foot

390
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:48,879
am so he'll have to move his foot
 

391
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,539
am so he'll have to move his foot
equally that makes is about equal so

392
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:51,549
equally that makes is about equal so
 

393
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,639
equally that makes is about equal so
when he sees me gearing up to move he

394
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:53,649
when he sees me gearing up to move he
 

395
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,439
when he sees me gearing up to move he
can take a step and easily get out of

396
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:55,449
can take a step and easily get out of
 

397
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:55,919
can take a step and easily get out of
range

398
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:55,929
range
 

399
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,779
range
our feet are approximately the same

400
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:57,789
our feet are approximately the same
 

401
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,019
our feet are approximately the same
speed and so if I'm that far from him he

402
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:01,029
speed and so if I'm that far from him he
 

403
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,029
speed and so if I'm that far from him he
can usually get out of the range if you

404
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
can usually get out of the range if you
 

405
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,699
can usually get out of the range if you
practice this you'll regularly about 90%

406
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:05,709
practice this you'll regularly about 90%
 

407
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,989
practice this you'll regularly about 90%
of the time be able to get out of the

408
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:06,999
of the time be able to get out of the
 

409
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,519
of the time be able to get out of the
range and keep someone from cutting you

410
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,529
range and keep someone from cutting you
 

411
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,929
range and keep someone from cutting you
even with your hands behind your back

412
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:09,939
even with your hands behind your back
 

413
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,329
even with your hands behind your back
okay now we're gonna see the other side

414
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:12,339
okay now we're gonna see the other side
 

415
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,279
okay now we're gonna see the other side
of this game so we're gonna move in and

416
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:14,289
of this game so we're gonna move in and
 

417
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,289
of this game so we're gonna move in and
now I'm gonna set the knife right at the

418
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:16,299
now I'm gonna set the knife right at the
 

419
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,939
now I'm gonna set the knife right at the
shoulder touching distance so now my

420
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:17,949
shoulder touching distance so now my
 

421
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,319
shoulder touching distance so now my
knifes right here shoulder touching

422
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,329
knifes right here shoulder touching
 

423
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,269
knifes right here shoulder touching
distance so this means I no longer have

424
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:21,279
distance so this means I no longer have
 

425
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,729
distance so this means I no longer have
to take a step to cut Josh I'm gonna

426
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:23,739
to take a step to cut Josh I'm gonna
 

427
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,889
to take a step to cut Josh I'm gonna
move just as fast as I did before maybe

428
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:25,899
move just as fast as I did before maybe
 

429
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,659
move just as fast as I did before maybe
just as elusive and quickly as I can

430
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:27,669
just as elusive and quickly as I can
 

431
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,399
just as elusive and quickly as I can
with it and he is going to try his best

432
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:29,409
with it and he is going to try his best
 

433
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,499
with it and he is going to try his best
again to move out of range keeping his

434
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:31,509
again to move out of range keeping his
 

435
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:38,519
again to move out of range keeping his
hands behind his back okay so you can

436
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:38,529
hands behind his back okay so you can
 

437
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,649
hands behind his back okay so you can
see there every single time I got him

438
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:40,659
see there every single time I got him
 

439
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,139
see there every single time I got him
because josh is horribly inefficient at

440
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:43,149
because josh is horribly inefficient at
 

441
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,119
because josh is horribly inefficient at
doing this it's because I have a huge

442
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,129
doing this it's because I have a huge
 

443
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,059
doing this it's because I have a huge
advantage the arm and hand move way

444
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:48,069
advantage the arm and hand move way
 

445
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,759
advantage the arm and hand move way
faster than the foot does so in this

446
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:50,769
faster than the foot does so in this
 

447
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,399
faster than the foot does so in this
range I don't have to take a step to cut

448
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:53,409
range I don't have to take a step to cut
 

449
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,979
range I don't have to take a step to cut
Josh but josh does have to take a step

450
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:55,989
Josh but josh does have to take a step
 

451
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,569
Josh but josh does have to take a step
in order to avoid the night

452
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:57,579
in order to avoid the night
 

453
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,459
in order to avoid the night
so that means I'm at a huge advantage if

454
00:07:59,459 --> 00:07:59,469
so that means I'm at a huge advantage if
 

455
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,829
so that means I'm at a huge advantage if
I take a cut here really hard for Josh

456
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:01,839
I take a cut here really hard for Josh
 

457
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,449
I take a cut here really hard for Josh
to get his body out of there before I

458
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:03,459
to get his body out of there before I
 

459
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,519
to get his body out of there before I
can successfully make the cut now this

460
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:05,529
can successfully make the cut now this
 

461
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,019
can successfully make the cut now this
tells us a really important thing about

462
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:07,029
tells us a really important thing about
 

463
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,019
tells us a really important thing about
knife fighting it tells us that if he's

464
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:10,029
knife fighting it tells us that if he's
 

465
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,419
knife fighting it tells us that if he's
trying to deal with the knife he wants

466
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:12,429
trying to deal with the knife he wants
 

467
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,879
trying to deal with the knife he wants
to be an excess of arm's length from me

468
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:14,889
to be an excess of arm's length from me
 

469
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,159
to be an excess of arm's length from me
so our

470
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,169
so our
 

471
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,100
so our
out of range is this for me is the knife

472
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,110
out of range is this for me is the knife
 

473
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,019
out of range is this for me is the knife
attacker I really don't want to attack

474
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,029
attacker I really don't want to attack
 

475
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,820
attacker I really don't want to attack
him outside of this range it's gonna be

476
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:22,830
him outside of this range it's gonna be
 

477
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,619
him outside of this range it's gonna be
slow and clumsy and it's gonna be hard

478
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:24,629
slow and clumsy and it's gonna be hard
 

479
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,670
slow and clumsy and it's gonna be hard
for me to get in there

480
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
for me to get in there
 

481
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,860
for me to get in there
for him he wants to keep it at this

482
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:27,870
for him he wants to keep it at this
 

483
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,290
for him he wants to keep it at this
range or greater so meaning if he sees

484
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,300
range or greater so meaning if he sees
 

485
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,879
range or greater so meaning if he sees
me with the knife he always wants to say

486
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:31,889
me with the knife he always wants to say
 

487
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,769
me with the knife he always wants to say
greater than this distance that gives

488
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:33,779
greater than this distance that gives
 

489
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,300
greater than this distance that gives
him a really fair chance of being able

490
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,310
him a really fair chance of being able
 

491
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,370
him a really fair chance of being able
to stay out of a range of the knife so

492
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,380
to stay out of a range of the knife so
 

493
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,079
to stay out of a range of the knife so
when we're doing this he's gonna stay

494
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:39,089
when we're doing this he's gonna stay
 

495
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,670
when we're doing this he's gonna stay
out of that range that's his goal

496
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,680
out of that range that's his goal
 

497
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,199
out of that range that's his goal
because the nice way more powerful than

498
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:42,209
because the nice way more powerful than
 

499
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,879
because the nice way more powerful than
his body stopping with his arms and

500
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:43,889
his body stopping with his arms and
 

501
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,620
his body stopping with his arms and
stuff like that is a bad idea in general

502
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:45,630
stuff like that is a bad idea in general
 

503
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,180
stuff like that is a bad idea in general
so he's gonna do it with this beat and

504
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,190
so he's gonna do it with this beat and
 

505
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,769
so he's gonna do it with this beat and
if he stays at that range it will be

506
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:48,779
if he stays at that range it will be
 

507
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,939
if he stays at that range it will be
possible okay

508
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:49,949
possible okay
 

509
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:51,769
possible okay
next we're gonna talk about protecting

510
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:51,779
next we're gonna talk about protecting
 

511
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,800
next we're gonna talk about protecting
your vital organs all right third part

512
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:54,810
your vital organs all right third part
 

513
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,410
your vital organs all right third part
in high in snake theory so the first

514
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,420
in high in snake theory so the first
 

515
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,879
in high in snake theory so the first
part we talked about how knife fighting

516
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:58,889
part we talked about how knife fighting
 

517
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,829
part we talked about how knife fighting
really doesn't exist and it's

518
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:00,839
really doesn't exist and it's
 

519
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,329
really doesn't exist and it's
provocative on purpose but if you

520
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,339
provocative on purpose but if you
 

521
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,439
provocative on purpose but if you
haven't seen that video go ahead and

522
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:03,449
haven't seen that video go ahead and
 

523
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,540
haven't seen that video go ahead and
check it out the second part was the

524
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,550
check it out the second part was the
 

525
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,939
check it out the second part was the
hand is faster than the foot and now

526
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:07,949
hand is faster than the foot and now
 

527
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,889
hand is faster than the foot and now
this part we're gonna talk about what

528
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899
this part we're gonna talk about what
 

529
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,259
this part we're gonna talk about what
happens when the range has broke down so

530
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:12,269
happens when the range has broke down so
 

531
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,060
happens when the range has broke down so
from the hand is faster than the foot

532
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,070
from the hand is faster than the foot
 

533
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,710
from the hand is faster than the foot
video you should be able to gather that

534
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,720
video you should be able to gather that
 

535
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,110
video you should be able to gather that
you always want to be greater than

536
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
you always want to be greater than
 

537
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,030
you always want to be greater than
fingertip distance when you're dealing

538
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
fingertip distance when you're dealing
 

539
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,230
fingertip distance when you're dealing
with someone with a knife now you have

540
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,240
with someone with a knife now you have
 

541
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,180
with someone with a knife now you have
to include the length of the knife with

542
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,190
to include the length of the knife with
 

543
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,730
to include the length of the knife with
that so you can see that is now the

544
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:25,740
that so you can see that is now the
 

545
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,650
that so you can see that is now the
distance he has to adjust to when we're

546
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,660
distance he has to adjust to when we're
 

547
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,240
distance he has to adjust to when we're
dealing with that and so this means that

548
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,250
dealing with that and so this means that
 

549
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,680
dealing with that and so this means that
when I go to attack I have to take a

550
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,690
when I go to attack I have to take a
 

551
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,420
when I go to attack I have to take a
step and he has to take a step and that

552
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,430
step and he has to take a step and that
 

553
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,040
step and he has to take a step and that
will get him out of range but if I'm

554
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,050
will get him out of range but if I'm
 

555
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,259
will get him out of range but if I'm
inside of this he's going to have to do

556
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:36,269
inside of this he's going to have to do
 

557
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,420
inside of this he's going to have to do
something to try and keep my hand from

558
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,430
something to try and keep my hand from
 

559
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,490
something to try and keep my hand from
cutting him so meaning that I can move

560
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,500
cutting him so meaning that I can move
 

561
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,069
cutting him so meaning that I can move
so fast at this range that he will not

562
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:43,079
so fast at this range that he will not
 

563
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,810
so fast at this range that he will not
be able to just step out of the way

564
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
be able to just step out of the way
 

565
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,759
be able to just step out of the way
he'll always be too slow always be

566
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:46,769
he'll always be too slow always be
 

567
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,680
he'll always be too slow always be
behind and he needs to use his hands and

568
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:48,690
behind and he needs to use his hands and
 

569
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,079
behind and he needs to use his hands and
arms to keep him from getting stabbed

570
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:51,089
arms to keep him from getting stabbed
 

571
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,870
arms to keep him from getting stabbed
we're gonna call this suppression so

572
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:53,880
we're gonna call this suppression so
 

573
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,130
we're gonna call this suppression so
what he wants to do is be able to get

574
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,140
what he wants to do is be able to get
 

575
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,829
what he wants to do is be able to get
suppression now for Josh he wants to

576
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
suppression now for Josh he wants to
 

577
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,840
suppression now for Josh he wants to
keep me from cutting any vital targets

578
00:09:59,840 --> 00:09:59,850
keep me from cutting any vital targets
 

579
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,059
keep me from cutting any vital targets
so really vital targets for him are

580
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,069
so really vital targets for him are
 

581
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,550
so really vital targets for him are
anything functional his biceps and

582
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
anything functional his biceps and
 

583
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,710
anything functional his biceps and
triceps he doesn't want to get those cut

584
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
triceps he doesn't want to get those cut
 

585
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,809
triceps he doesn't want to get those cut
he gets those cut he loses his function

586
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:08,819
he gets those cut he loses his function
 

587
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,939
he gets those cut he loses his function
of his arm that's really really bad he

588
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:10,949
of his arm that's really really bad he
 

589
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:13,250
of his arm that's really really bad he
doesn't want the inside of his forearms

590
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,260
doesn't want the inside of his forearms
 

591
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,350
doesn't want the inside of his forearms
to get cut the ligaments in here are

592
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
to get cut the ligaments in here are
 

593
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,000
to get cut the ligaments in here are
responsible for closing his hand he

594
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,010
responsible for closing his hand he
 

595
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,439
responsible for closing his hand he
needs to be able to open and close his

596
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:18,449
needs to be able to open and close his
 

597
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,269
needs to be able to open and close his
hands when we're fighting this is also

598
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:20,279
hands when we're fighting this is also
 

599
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,850
hands when we're fighting this is also
arterial meaning that this is oxygenated

600
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,860
arterial meaning that this is oxygenated
 

601
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,620
arterial meaning that this is oxygenated
blood and if he's losing oxygen blood

602
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,630
blood and if he's losing oxygen blood
 

603
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,540
blood and if he's losing oxygen blood
more likely to go into shock and pass

604
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,550
more likely to go into shock and pass
 

605
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,750
more likely to go into shock and pass
so that's bad news he doesn't want to

606
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
so that's bad news he doesn't want to
 

607
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,460
so that's bad news he doesn't want to
lose anything in here this is probably

608
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,470
lose anything in here this is probably
 

609
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,050
lose anything in here this is probably
gonna kill him at some point in his life

610
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,060
gonna kill him at some point in his life
 

611
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,790
gonna kill him at some point in his life
he might get through this fight but you

612
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
he might get through this fight but you
 

613
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
he might get through this fight but you
know three four hours down the road he's

614
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,570
know three four hours down the road he's
 

615
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,449
know three four hours down the road he's
gonna be in bad shock all kinds of

616
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:38,459
gonna be in bad shock all kinds of
 

617
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,380
gonna be in bad shock all kinds of
terrible things are happening in this

618
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,390
terrible things are happening in this
 

619
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,880
terrible things are happening in this
guy's body so he doesn't want to get cut

620
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:40,890
guy's body so he doesn't want to get cut
 

621

contemporary knife targeting kind of

636
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,420
contemporary knife targeting kind of
 

637
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,639
contemporary knife targeting kind of
talks about these ideas and gives you

638
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:58,649
talks about these ideas and gives you
 

639
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,280
talks about these ideas and gives you
some basic ideas of what you want to get

640
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,290
some basic ideas of what you want to get
 

641
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,870
some basic ideas of what you want to get
cut and don't want to get cut now

642
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
cut and don't want to get cut now
 

643
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,550
cut and don't want to get cut now
ideally wants nothing cut but he's

644
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
ideally wants nothing cut but he's
 

645
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,780
ideally wants nothing cut but he's
probably gonna have to make a sacrifice

646
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:05,790
probably gonna have to make a sacrifice
 

647
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,759
probably gonna have to make a sacrifice
at this range and something's gonna get

648
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:07,769
at this range and something's gonna get
 

649
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,030
at this range and something's gonna get
cut ideally if anything had to get cut

650
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
cut ideally if anything had to get cut
 

651
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,009
cut ideally if anything had to get cut
he wants it to be along the bone on the

652
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:13,019
he wants it to be along the bone on the
 

653
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,480
he wants it to be along the bone on the
outside of his forearm here now the

654
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,490
outside of his forearm here now the
 

655
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,639
outside of his forearm here now the
reason for that is there are no arteries

656
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:16,649
reason for that is there are no arteries
 

657
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,680
reason for that is there are no arteries
in here there are no ligaments in here

658
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:18,690
in here there are no ligaments in here
 

659
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,660
in here there are no ligaments in here
and no major muscle groups right here so

660
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:20,670
and no major muscle groups right here so
 

661
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,579
and no major muscle groups right here so
if the knife comes across that he's

662
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:22,589
if the knife comes across that he's
 

663
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,740
if the knife comes across that he's
likely to stay highly functional now he

664
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:24,750
likely to stay highly functional now he
 

665
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,540
likely to stay highly functional now he
doesn't want to get cut at all but he'll

666
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:26,550
doesn't want to get cut at all but he'll
 

667
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,430
doesn't want to get cut at all but he'll
stay functional if he gets cut in here

668
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:28,440
stay functional if he gets cut in here
 

669
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
stay functional if he gets cut in here
so that's the main part of what he's

670
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,450
so that's the main part of what he's
 

671
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,660
so that's the main part of what he's
using when the knife comes in and he's

672
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:32,670
using when the knife comes in and he's
 

673
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,790
using when the knife comes in and he's
doing that by simply angling his arm out

674
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
doing that by simply angling his arm out
 

675
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,650
doing that by simply angling his arm out
as the knife comes in so if the necklace

676
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
as the knife comes in so if the necklace
 

677
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,630
as the knife comes in so if the necklace
come in high he'd put his arm up like

678
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
come in high he'd put his arm up like
 

679
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,889
come in high he'd put his arm up like
this to keep the knife away

680
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:39,899
this to keep the knife away
 

681
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,690
this to keep the knife away
if the knife was coming in low he'd put

682
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:41,700
if the knife was coming in low he'd put
 

683
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,220
if the knife was coming in low he'd put
his arm down like that to keep the knife

684
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,230
his arm down like that to keep the knife
 

685
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,680
his arm down like that to keep the knife
away now this means that even if I come

686
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:45,690
away now this means that even if I come
 

687
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,230
away now this means that even if I come
back he's not gonna suffer a severe cut

688
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
back he's not gonna suffer a severe cut
 

689
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,180
back he's not gonna suffer a severe cut
if he got cut there now look we'd like

690
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,190
if he got cut there now look we'd like
 

691
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,100
if he got cut there now look we'd like
to not use the arms that would be ideal

692
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,110
to not use the arms that would be ideal
 

693
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,290
to not use the arms that would be ideal
but at this range he's gonna have to use

694
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:54,300
but at this range he's gonna have to use
 

695
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,060
but at this range he's gonna have to use
the arms to protect him if anything

696
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,070
the arms to protect him if anything
 

697
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,800
the arms to protect him if anything
comes up the middle he's gonna cross his

698
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:57,810
comes up the middle he's gonna cross his
 

699
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,600
comes up the middle he's gonna cross his
arms and stop it up the middle like this

700
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,610
arms and stop it up the middle like this
 

701
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,550
arms and stop it up the middle like this
if anything comes directly from the top

702
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,560
if anything comes directly from the top
 

703
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,380
if anything comes directly from the top
again it cross his arms and stop it from

704
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,390
again it cross his arms and stop it from
 

705
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,780
again it cross his arms and stop it from
coming in a top so that's the basic way

706
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:05,790
coming in a top so that's the basic way
 

707
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,819
coming in a top so that's the basic way
he's gonna negotiate this so when I

708
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:07,829
he's gonna negotiate this so when I
 

709
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,740
he's gonna negotiate this so when I
tried to stab in he's gonna put those

710
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:09,750
tried to stab in he's gonna put those
 

711
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,540
tried to stab in he's gonna put those
arms down and protect himself he also

712
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:11,550
arms down and protect himself he also
 

713
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,010
arms down and protect himself he also
wants to work on shrugging his shoulders

714
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,020
wants to work on shrugging his shoulders
 

715
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,439
wants to work on shrugging his shoulders
by shrugging his shoulders he cuts off a

716
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:15,449
by shrugging his shoulders he cuts off a
 

717
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,120
by shrugging his shoulders he cuts off a
possibility that I can get in there to

718
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,130
possibility that I can get in there to
 

719
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,220
possibility that I can get in there to
the carotid arteries and he's also gonna

720
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,230
the carotid arteries and he's also gonna
 

721
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,780
the carotid arteries and he's also gonna
try and keep his elbows around his

722
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:20,790
try and keep his elbows around his
 

723
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,430
try and keep his elbows around his
midsection so he can always use his

724
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440
midsection so he can always use his
 

725
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,230
midsection so he can always use his
elbow to keep me from getting in there

726
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
elbow to keep me from getting in there
 

727
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,519
elbow to keep me from getting in there
to the side because I'm coming in you

728
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:25,529
to the side because I'm coming in you
 

729
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,590
to the side because I'm coming in you
can stop that with his elbow now we're

730
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
can stop that with his elbow now we're
 

731
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,300
can stop that with his elbow now we're
gonna run another basic drill where we

732
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,310
gonna run another basic drill where we
 

733
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,130
gonna run another basic drill where we
see an ethicist and so remember I'm at

734
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,140
see an ethicist and so remember I'm at
 

735
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,470
see an ethicist and so remember I'm at
the major advantage here when I stab in

736
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:33,480
the major advantage here when I stab in
 

737
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,420
the major advantage here when I stab in
he's gonna try and defend himself for me

738
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,430
he's gonna try and defend himself for me
 

739
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,360
he's gonna try and defend himself for me
savvy

740
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,370

 

741
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,460

okay now you can see still a little

742
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,470
okay now you can see still a little
 

743
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,650
okay now you can see still a little
dicey it's scary beneath this range is a

744
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:46,660
dicey it's scary beneath this range is a
 

745
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,900
dicey it's scary beneath this range is a
really bad idea you do not want to be in

746
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:48,910
really bad idea you do not want to be in
 

747
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,760
really bad idea you do not want to be in
this range however you need to get your

748
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:50,770
this range however you need to get your
 

749
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,710
this range however you need to get your
arms up to protect the vital spots in

750
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
arms up to protect the vital spots in
 

751
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,630
arms up to protect the vital spots in
your body so you need to get some kind

752
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:54,640
your body so you need to get some kind
 

753
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,910
your body so you need to get some kind
of suppression so suppression is gonna

754
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:56,920
of suppression so suppression is gonna
 

755
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,500
of suppression so suppression is gonna
lead us to our next really important

756
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,510
lead us to our next really important
 

757
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,330
lead us to our next really important
keys when we talk about what happens

758
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:00,340
keys when we talk about what happens
 

759
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,400
keys when we talk about what happens
when you suppress and they try to get

760
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,410
when you suppress and they try to get
 

761
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,350
when you suppress and they try to get
around the suppression in some way so

762
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,360
around the suppression in some way so
 

763
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,540
around the suppression in some way so
stay tuned for the next video all right

764
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:06,550
stay tuned for the next video all right
 

765

so this is part four of the video series
 

767
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,130
so this is part four of the video series
on Heinen's knife theory first video we

768
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,140
on Heinen's knife theory first video we
 

769
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,570
on Heinen's knife theory first video we
talked about why knife fighting doesn't

770
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:12,580
talked about why knife fighting doesn't
 

771
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,670
talked about why knife fighting doesn't
exist second video we talked about how

772
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:14,680
exist second video we talked about how
 

773
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,560
exist second video we talked about how
the hands faster than the foot third

774
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:16,570
the hands faster than the foot third
 

775
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,670
the hands faster than the foot third
video we talked about how you can

776
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
video we talked about how you can
 

777
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,230
video we talked about how you can
protect your vital organs when you're in

778
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,240
protect your vital organs when you're in
 

779
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,060
protect your vital organs when you're in
that danger zone right so when you're

780
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,070
that danger zone right so when you're
 

781
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,760
that danger zone right so when you're
inside of range the danger zone what do

782
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:23,770
inside of range the danger zone what do
 

783
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,410
inside of range the danger zone what do
you do and how you basically shield them

784
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:25,420
you do and how you basically shield them
 

785
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,540
you do and how you basically shield them
when your arm reaches out and makes

786
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,550
when your arm reaches out and makes
 

787
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,190
when your arm reaches out and makes
connection with someone attacking we

788
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
connection with someone attacking we
 

789
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,470
connection with someone attacking we
call that suppression so my basic idea

790
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:31,480
call that suppression so my basic idea
 

791
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,180
call that suppression so my basic idea
here is I want to get the knife to Josh

792
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,190
here is I want to get the knife to Josh
 

793
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,100
here is I want to get the knife to Josh
and he's suppressing my ability to do

794
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,110
and he's suppressing my ability to do
 

795
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,690
and he's suppressing my ability to do
that keep me from doing now there's not

796
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:36,700
that keep me from doing now there's not
 

797
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,000
that keep me from doing now there's not
a control here meaning he's not holding

798
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,010
a control here meaning he's not holding
 

799
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,890
a control here meaning he's not holding
my arm my arm can still do whatever but

800
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:40,900
my arm my arm can still do whatever but
 

801
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,980
my arm my arm can still do whatever but
he's suppressing my attempt to attack

802
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:42,990
he's suppressing my attempt to attack
 

803
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,170
he's suppressing my attempt to attack
when he suppresses I'm gonna have one of

804
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,180
when he suppresses I'm gonna have one of
 

805
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,750
when he suppresses I'm gonna have one of
just a few options when he suppresses I

806
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:48,760
just a few options when he suppresses I
 

807
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,480
just a few options when he suppresses I
will either a retrieve the knight so

808
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,490
will either a retrieve the knight so
 

809
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,010
will either a retrieve the knight so
meaning I pull it back to me so I can

810
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,020
meaning I pull it back to me so I can
 

811
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,430
meaning I pull it back to me so I can
use it again be attempt to go around the

812
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:56,440
use it again be attempt to go around the
 

813
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,870
use it again be attempt to go around the
suppression or sea drive through the

814
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
suppression or sea drive through the
 

815
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,570
suppression or sea drive through the
suppression those are my options right

816
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:03,580
suppression those are my options right
 

817
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,190
suppression those are my options right
those three options are all I have

818
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,200
those three options are all I have
 

819
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,080
those three options are all I have
once he suppresses I'm either gonna

820
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,090
once he suppresses I'm either gonna
 

821
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,380
once he suppresses I'm either gonna
recover the knife I'm going to go around

822
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,390
recover the knife I'm going to go around
 

823
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,360
recover the knife I'm going to go around
his suppression or I'm gonna drive

824
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,370
his suppression or I'm gonna drive
 

825
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,400
his suppression or I'm gonna drive
through his suppression those are my

826
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,410
through his suppression those are my
 

827
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,320
through his suppression those are my
main ideas now he needs to have options

828
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,330
main ideas now he needs to have options
 

829
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,870
main ideas now he needs to have options
for all of those different ideas so once

830
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
for all of those different ideas so once
 

831
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,520
for all of those different ideas so once
he's got suppression he needs to have

832
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,530
he's got suppression he needs to have
 

833
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,980
he's got suppression he needs to have
options his number one goal would be to

834
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,990
options his number one goal would be to
 

835
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,010
options his number one goal would be to
go from suppression to control so if he

836
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,020
go from suppression to control so if he
 

837
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,600
go from suppression to control so if he
suppressed here he would like to

838
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,610
suppressed here he would like to
 

839
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,980
suppressed here he would like to
immediately be able to control that

840
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:28,990
immediately be able to control that
 

841
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,630
immediately be able to control that
knife in a way so that I can't use it

842
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:30,640
knife in a way so that I can't use it
 

843
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,110
knife in a way so that I can't use it
anymore

844
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
anymore
 

845
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,000
anymore
now essentially as long as he can keep a

846
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,010
now essentially as long as he can keep a
 

847
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,190
now essentially as long as he can keep a
hold to this he's nullified my ability

848
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,200
hold to this he's nullified my ability
 

849
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,750
hold to this he's nullified my ability
to use a knight so he's going from

850
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:36,760
to use a knight so he's going from
 

851
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,030
to use a knight so he's going from
suppression to control that's his number

852
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
suppression to control that's his number
 

853
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,700
suppression to control that's his number
one if he gets that depends on who's

854
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:41,710
one if he gets that depends on who's
 

855
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,250
one if he gets that depends on who's
first to act if we get suppression here

856
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,260
first to act if we get suppression here
 

857
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,070
first to act if we get suppression here
and I'm first to act I'm

858
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,080
and I'm first to act I'm
 

859
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,710
and I'm first to act I'm
to recover go around or drive-thru

860
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
to recover go around or drive-thru
 

861
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,990
to recover go around or drive-thru
before he does anything if we get

862
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,000
before he does anything if we get
 

863
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,670
before he does anything if we get
suppression and he acts before I act

864
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:52,680
suppression and he acts before I act
 

865
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,040
suppression and he acts before I act
then he's gonna get the control so he

866
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,050
then he's gonna get the control so he
 

867
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,770
then he's gonna get the control so he
wants to get to control but once we have

868
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:57,780
wants to get to control but once we have
 

869
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,780
wants to get to control but once we have
the suppression I've got a few different

870
00:14:59,780 --> 00:14:59,790
the suppression I've got a few different
 

871
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,760
the suppression I've got a few different
options each one of those options will

872
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:01,770
options each one of those options will
 

873
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,170
options each one of those options will
depend on where we're at in the stage

874
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,180
depend on where we're at in the stage
 

875
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,790
depend on where we're at in the stage
and we're gonna look at some drills to

876
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
and we're gonna look at some drills to
 

877
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,280
and we're gonna look at some drills to
work through those after this all right

878
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,290
work through those after this all right
 

879
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,590
work through those after this all right
so we talked to this our fifth video in

880
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
so we talked to this our fifth video in
 

881
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
so we talked to this our fifth video in
the series we talked about all the major

882
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,490
the series we talked about all the major
 

883
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,160
the series we talked about all the major
parts of the theory right it's important

884
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,170
parts of the theory right it's important
 

885
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,360
parts of the theory right it's important
understand is just such things a knife

886
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,370
understand is just such things a knife
 

887
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,560
understand is just such things a knife
fight and why that's really really

888
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,570
fight and why that's really really
 

889
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,930
fight and why that's really really
dangerous then moving on to that the

890
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,940
dangerous then moving on to that the
 

891
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,280
dangerous then moving on to that the
hand is faster than the foot and

892
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,290
hand is faster than the foot and
 

893
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,480
hand is faster than the foot and
understanding that and that's always

894
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,490
understanding that and that's always
 

895
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,240
understanding that and that's always
gonna factor in to knife situations how

896
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,250
gonna factor in to knife situations how
 

897
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,190
gonna factor in to knife situations how
to protect the vital organs when you're

898
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,200
to protect the vital organs when you're
 

899
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,430
to protect the vital organs when you're
inside of that knife range now that

900
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,440
inside of that knife range now that
 

901
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,560
inside of that knife range now that
vital organ protection is called

902
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:30,570
vital organ protection is called
 

903
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,960
vital organ protection is called
suppression so from that suppression I

904
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:32,970
suppression so from that suppression I
 

905
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,610
suppression so from that suppression I
have those three options we talked about

906
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:34,620
have those three options we talked about
 

907
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,990
have those three options we talked about
in the last video I'm either gonna

908
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
in the last video I'm either gonna
 

909
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,730
in the last video I'm either gonna
recover the weapon I'm gonna go around

910
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:37,740
recover the weapon I'm gonna go around
 

911
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,290
recover the weapon I'm gonna go around
his suppression or I'm gonna drive

912
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,300
his suppression or I'm gonna drive
 

913
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,940
his suppression or I'm gonna drive
through there's only three things I can

914
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:40,950
through there's only three things I can
 

915
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,850
through there's only three things I can
possibly do he needs to be able to move

916
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:43,860
possibly do he needs to be able to move
 

917
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,770
possibly do he needs to be able to move
with me if I try to go around so you're

918
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:45,780
with me if I try to go around so you're
 

919
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,900
with me if I try to go around so you're
gonna address going around first so if I

920
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:47,910
gonna address going around first so if I
 

921
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,540
gonna address going around first so if I
move around this he wants to be able to

922
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,550
move around this he wants to be able to
 

923
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,000
move around this he wants to be able to
stick to me no matter what I do so we're

924
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,010
stick to me no matter what I do so we're
 

925
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,560
stick to me no matter what I do so we're
gonna do a real flowy kind of funny

926
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,570
gonna do a real flowy kind of funny
 

927
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,810
gonna do a real flowy kind of funny
drill now this drill it looks weird and

928
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:56,820
drill now this drill it looks weird and
 

929
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,270
drill now this drill it looks weird and
in a knife situation where you're in

930
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,280
in a knife situation where you're in
 

931
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,830
in a knife situation where you're in
conflict with the knife it would never

932
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:00,840
conflict with the knife it would never
 

933
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,680
conflict with the knife it would never
look like this but this drill is giving

934
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,690
look like this but this drill is giving
 

935
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,900
look like this but this drill is giving
you a skill set for when they quickly

936
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,910
you a skill set for when they quickly
 

937
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,750
you a skill set for when they quickly
try to come around you're suppression so

938
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:08,760
try to come around you're suppression so
 

939
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,430
try to come around you're suppression so
Josh all with you start with suppression

940
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,440
Josh all with you start with suppression
 

941
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,380
Josh all with you start with suppression
he's not gonna move his feet and I'm not

942
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,390
he's not gonna move his feet and I'm not
 

943
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,390
he's not gonna move his feet and I'm not
gonna move Mikey what I am gonna do is

944
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,400
gonna move Mikey what I am gonna do is
 

945
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,670
gonna move Mikey what I am gonna do is
try and sneak around his arm and cut his

946
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:16,680
try and sneak around his arm and cut his
 

947
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
try and sneak around his arm and cut his
body right so as we go here I'm trying

948
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,330
body right so as we go here I'm trying
 

949
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,060
body right so as we go here I'm trying
to get in there and cut it what he wants

950
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,070
to get in there and cut it what he wants
 

951

suppression those are my three options
the last show we talked exclusively

1052
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:02,930
the last show we talked exclusively
 

1053
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,590
the last show we talked exclusively
about moving around his suppression now

1054
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
about moving around his suppression now
 

1055
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,660
about moving around his suppression now
we're gonna add to that moving through

1056
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:07,670
we're gonna add to that moving through
 

1057
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,980
we're gonna add to that moving through
his suppression so what that would look

1058
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:08,990
his suppression so what that would look
 

1059
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,960
his suppression so what that would look
like is I'm here and I'm not gonna go

1060
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:10,970
like is I'm here and I'm not gonna go
 

1061
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,490
like is I'm here and I'm not gonna go
around but I'm gonna force the knife in

1062
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:12,500
around but I'm gonna force the knife in
 

1063
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,320
around but I'm gonna force the knife in
in a way that goes right into him so

1064
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,330
in a way that goes right into him so
 

1065
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,910
in a way that goes right into him so
what he's gonna be able to do now is

1066
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:15,920
what he's gonna be able to do now is
 

1067
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,070
what he's gonna be able to do now is
move his feet so the last drill we

1068
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
move his feet so the last drill we
 

1069
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,420
move his feet so the last drill we
didn't allow him to move his feet and

1070
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,430
didn't allow him to move his feet and
 

1071
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,800
didn't allow him to move his feet and
the reason for that was because we're

1072
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:20,810
the reason for that was because we're
 

1073
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,660
the reason for that was because we're
setting up that close distance he he got

1074
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:22,670
setting up that close distance he he got
 

1075
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,760
setting up that close distance he he got
stuck in however now he can move his

1076
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:24,770
stuck in however now he can move his
 

1077
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,610
stuck in however now he can move his
feet in this drill I'm not going to

1078
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:27,620
feet in this drill I'm not going to
 

1079
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,560
feet in this drill I'm not going to
recover the weapon I'm only going to go

1080
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:29,570
recover the weapon I'm only going to go
 

1081
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,780
recover the weapon I'm only going to go
around and press through and he is not

1082
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:31,790
around and press through and he is not
 

1083
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,660
around and press through and he is not
going to attempt to control or

1084
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:33,670
going to attempt to control or
 

1085
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:44,370
going to attempt to control or
outdistancing

1086
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:44,380

 

1087
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,660

okay so that's the idea you can see

1088
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:46,670
okay so that's the idea you can see
 

1089
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,580
okay so that's the idea you can see

1095
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,610
partner's you shouldn't go so fast that
they're completely out work right so if

1096
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:54,620
they're completely out work right so if
 

1097
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,540
they're completely out work right so if
it looks something like this okay you're

1098
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:58,550
it looks something like this okay you're
 

1099
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,670
it looks something like this okay you're
going too hard on your partner he can't

1100
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:00,680
going too hard on your partner he can't
 

1101
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
going too hard on your partner he can't

1103
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,360
process what's going on you want to go
real slow at first and see if he can

1104
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,370
real slow at first and see if he can
 

1105
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,730
real slow at first and see if he can
process right so right there he's really

1106
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:06,740
process right so right there he's really
 

1107
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,070
process right so right there he's really
easily able to work and that's where I

1108
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,080
easily able to work and that's where I
 

1109
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,140
easily able to work and that's where I
want to keep him okay now as I want to

1110
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,150
want to keep him okay now as I want to
 

1111
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,490
want to keep him okay now as I want to
make him work harder I just add a little

1112
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:12,500
make him work harder I just add a little
 

1113
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,330
make him work harder I just add a little
more speed

1114
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:13,340
more speed
 

1115
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,950
more speed
I add my targeting I changed my

1116
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
I add my targeting I changed my
 

1117
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,690
I add my targeting I changed my
targeting a little bit but we're playing

1118
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:16,700
targeting a little bit but we're playing
 

1119
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,210
targeting a little bit but we're playing
basically the same game so when they're

1120
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,220
basically the same game so when they're
 

1121
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,830
basically the same game so when they're
trying to drive through your suppression

1122
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:20,840
trying to drive through your suppression
 

1123
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,300
trying to drive through your suppression
you're going to move your feet to allow

1124
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,310
you're going to move your feet to allow
 

1125
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,610
you're going to move your feet to allow
yourself to change angles on this okay

1126
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:24,620
yourself to change angles on this okay
 

1127
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,830
yourself to change angles on this okay
so now we am at a drill for moving

1128
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:26,840
so now we am at a drill for moving
 

1129
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,620
so now we am at a drill for moving
around and we've got a drill for someone

1130
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:29,630
around and we've got a drill for someone
 

1131
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,420
around and we've got a drill for someone
trying to push through what about a

1132
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,430
trying to push through what about a
 

1133
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,030
trying to push through what about a
recovery drill so what if I recover what

1134
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,040
recovery drill so what if I recover what
 

1135
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,970
recovery drill so what if I recover what
should he do all right so this in this

1136
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:36,980
should he do all right so this in this
 

1137
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,140
should he do all right so this in this
part we're going to talk a little more

1138
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,150
part we're going to talk a little more
 

1139
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,640
part we're going to talk a little more
about suppression so we had our first

1140
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:39,650
about suppression so we had our first
 

1141
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,050
about suppression so we had our first
ideas with suppression remember there's

1142
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,060
ideas with suppression remember there's
 

1143
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,460
ideas with suppression remember there's
only three things I can do once he's got

1144
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:42,470
only three things I can do once he's got
 

1145
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,710
only three things I can do once he's got
suppression in place then I can recover

1146
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
suppression in place then I can recover
 

1147
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,950
suppression in place then I can recover
I can move around or I can drive through

1148
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:47,960
I can move around or I can drive through
 

1149
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,600
I can move around or I can drive through
those are my three options with the

1150
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:49,610
those are my three options with the
 

1151
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,000
those are my three options with the
suppression we covered a drill for

1152
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,010
suppression we covered a drill for
 

1153
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,800
suppression we covered a drill for
moving around and him sticking with me

1154
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:53,810
moving around and him sticking with me
 

1155
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,290
moving around and him sticking with me
as I do this we worked a drill where I

1156
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,300
as I do this we worked a drill where I
 

1157
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,880
as I do this we worked a drill where I
try to push through and you can move his

1158
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:57,890
try to push through and you can move his
 

1159
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,100
try to push through and you can move his
feet to keep himself from getting taken

1160
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,110
feet to keep himself from getting taken
 

1161
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,560
feet to keep himself from getting taken
off now we're going to talk about what

1162
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,570
off now we're going to talk about what
 

1163
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,480
off now we're going to talk about what
happens when I recover now this is

1164
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,490
happens when I recover now this is
 

1165
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,730
happens when I recover now this is
potentially the most dangerous area for

1166
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:06,740
potentially the most dangerous area for
 

1167
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,910
potentially the most dangerous area for
Josh if I recover my weapon now he has

1168
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:09,920
Josh if I recover my weapon now he has
 

1169
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,040
Josh if I recover my weapon now he has
zero contact with my weapon and this

1170
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,050
zero contact with my weapon and this
 

1171
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,640
zero contact with my weapon and this
range

1172
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,650
range
 

1173
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,230
range
I'm almost certainly going to

1174
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm almost certainly going to
 

1175
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm almost certainly going to
successfully stab him right so he has no

1176
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:16,610
successfully stab him right so he has no
 

1177
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,800
successfully stab him right so he has no
contact with me doesn't know what's

1178
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:17,810
contact with me doesn't know what's
 

1179
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,960
contact with me doesn't know what's
going on remember my hand moves faster

1180
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,970
going on remember my hand moves faster
 

1181
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,060
going on remember my hand moves faster
than his foot so very likely that I'm

1182
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,070
than his foot so very likely that I'm
 

1183
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,370
than his foot so very likely that I'm
gonna get a successful shot in when Josh

1184
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:24,380
gonna get a successful shot in when Josh
 

1185
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,190
gonna get a successful shot in when Josh
sees me recover he wants to exit the

1186
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
sees me recover he wants to exit the
 

1187
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
sees me recover he wants to exit the
position right so he wants to create

1188
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:28,970
position right so he wants to create
 

1189
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,760
position right so he wants to create
distance the reason he wants to do that

1190
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:30,770
distance the reason he wants to do that
 

1191
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,560
distance the reason he wants to do that
is because I'm going to win at that

1192
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,570
is because I'm going to win at that
 

1193
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,990
is because I'm going to win at that
range so if he has any possible way of

1194
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,000
range so if he has any possible way of
 

1195
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,420
range so if he has any possible way of
getting out of there that's exactly what

1196
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,430
getting out of there that's exactly what
 

1197
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,160
getting out of there that's exactly what
he's gonna do the second I recover he's

1198
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,170
he's gonna do the second I recover he's
 

1199
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,230
he's gonna do the second I recover he's
gonna make distance now the way we're

1200
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,240
gonna make distance now the way we're
 

1201
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,360
gonna make distance now the way we're
gonna work this drill is the second he

1202
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,370
gonna work this drill is the second he
 

1203
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,550
gonna work this drill is the second he
tries to make distance and he gets there

1204
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:45,560
tries to make distance and he gets there
 

1205
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,450
tries to make distance and he gets there
successfully he's gonna say

1206
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:47,460
successfully he's gonna say
 

1207
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,700
successfully he's gonna say
reset right so we're gonna play the game

1208
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:49,710
reset right so we're gonna play the game
 

1209
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,620
reset right so we're gonna play the game
the same and the distance he's trying to

1210
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:51,630
the same and the distance he's trying to
 

1211
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,630
the same and the distance he's trying to
get through hot back for me the distance

1212
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,640
get through hot back for me the distance
 

1213
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,710
get through hot back for me the distance
he's trying to get through is this

1214
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
he's trying to get through is this
 

1215
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,660
he's trying to get through is this
distance or greater right that's where

1216
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:56,670
distance or greater right that's where
 

1217
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,280
distance or greater right that's where
he knows again that you can see I'm

1218
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,290
he knows again that you can see I'm
 

1219
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,650
he knows again that you can see I'm
coming and he can deal with me so what

1220
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:00,660
coming and he can deal with me so what
 

1221
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,880
coming and he can deal with me so what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna be at

1222
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:01,890
we're gonna do here is we're gonna be at
 

1223
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,830
we're gonna do here is we're gonna be at
this range we're gonna start the drill

1224
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
this range we're gonna start the drill
 

1225
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
this range we're gonna start the drill
runs exactly the same as before except

1226
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:05,610
runs exactly the same as before except
 

1227
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,430
runs exactly the same as before except
sometimes I'm gonna try to recover my

1228
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
sometimes I'm gonna try to recover my
 

1229
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,320
sometimes I'm gonna try to recover my
weapon reset okay so as soon as he gets

1230
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,330
weapon reset okay so as soon as he gets
 

1231
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,820
weapon reset okay so as soon as he gets
out of that space he's gonna try and

1232
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:13,830
out of that space he's gonna try and
 

1233
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,410
out of that space he's gonna try and
reset that distance we start here again

1234
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,420
reset that distance we start here again
 

1235
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,500
reset that distance we start here again
from suppression I work reset okay the

1236
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,510
from suppression I work reset okay the
 

1237
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,350
from suppression I work reset okay the
second he sees me get here he's getting

1238
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,360
second he sees me get here he's getting
 

1239
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,850
second he sees me get here he's getting
to distance and saying reset now the

1240
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:25,860
to distance and saying reset now the
 

1241
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,110
to distance and saying reset now the
reason he's doing that is because he

1242
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
reason he's doing that is because he
 

1243
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,210
reason he's doing that is because he
wants to train himself not to go into a

1244
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,220
wants to train himself not to go into a
 

1245
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,370
wants to train himself not to go into a
defended position here's what I mean by

1246
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,380
defended position here's what I mean by
 

1247
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,410
defended position here's what I mean by
that when I'm set up like this we call

1248
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:33,420
that when I'm set up like this we call
 

1249
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,020
that when I'm set up like this we call
this position defense I am in a defended

1250
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,030
this position defense I am in a defended
 

1251
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,090
this position defense I am in a defended
position when he comes in he'll hit my

1252
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,100
position when he comes in he'll hit my
 

1253
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,310
position when he comes in he'll hit my
hand before he can control the knife

1254
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
hand before he can control the knife
 

1255
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,470
hand before he can control the knife
which means I can pick and choose when I

1256
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
which means I can pick and choose when I
 

1257
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,900
which means I can pick and choose when I
attack him here as he reaches in I can

1258
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,910
attack him here as he reaches in I can
 

1259
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,400
attack him here as he reaches in I can
cut at him I can cut in his arms I can

1260
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,410
cut at him I can cut in his arms I can
 

1261
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,050
cut at him I can cut in his arms I can
cut in his body and I can protect my

1262
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,060
cut in his body and I can protect my
 

1263
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,820
cut in his body and I can protect my
knife the whole time it's a losing

1264
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:49,830
knife the whole time it's a losing
 

1265
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,860
knife the whole time it's a losing
proposition for him to try and push in

1266
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:51,870
proposition for him to try and push in
 

1267
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,990
proposition for him to try and push in
on the fence this fence keeps him there

1268
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
on the fence this fence keeps him there
 

1269
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,090
on the fence this fence keeps him there
the only choice he has is to get away

1270
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,100
the only choice he has is to get away
 

1271
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,280
the only choice he has is to get away
from the defended position he needs to

1272
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,290
from the defended position he needs to
 

1273
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,780
from the defended position he needs to
get out of there this is why it becomes

1274
00:21:59,780 --> 00:21:59,790
get out of there this is why it becomes
 

1275
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,640
get out of there this is why it becomes
really deadly if I managed to grab him

1276
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:01,650
really deadly if I managed to grab him
 

1277
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,720
really deadly if I managed to grab him
or hold him from this kind of position

1278
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,730
or hold him from this kind of position
 

1279
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,510
or hold him from this kind of position
super bad position to be in but if you

1280
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
super bad position to be in but if you
 

1281
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,250
super bad position to be in but if you
can possibly avoid it you're gonna make

1282
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,260
can possibly avoid it you're gonna make
 

1283
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,800
can possibly avoid it you're gonna make
distance the second my weapon recovers

1284
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:09,810
distance the second my weapon recovers
 

1285
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,750
distance the second my weapon recovers
he's going to make distance and he's

1286
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
he's going to make distance and he's
 

1287
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,210
he's going to make distance and he's
saying verbally reset and the reason

1288
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
saying verbally reset and the reason
 

1289
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,260
saying verbally reset and the reason
he's saying this because he's training

1290
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,270
he's saying this because he's training
 

1291
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,300
he's saying this because he's training
himself not to run back into a defended

1292
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,310
himself not to run back into a defended
 

1293
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,130
himself not to run back into a defended
position the last thing you want to do

1294
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,140
position the last thing you want to do

superior weapon to you is run in on it

1298
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,130
superior weapon to you is run in on it
 

1299
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,470
superior weapon to you is run in on it
right so don't run it into his dependent

1300
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
right so don't run it into his dependent
 

1301
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,940
right so don't run it into his dependent
position and this drill right now is

1302
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:25,950
position and this drill right now is
 

1303
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,410
position and this drill right now is
teaching you to think about that and say

1304
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,420
teaching you to think about that and say
 

1305
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,120
teaching you to think about that and say
reset when you get yourself back to the

1306
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,130
reset when you get yourself back to the
 

1307
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,340
reset when you get yourself back to the
safe position check out the next drill

1308
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,350
safe position check out the next drill
 

1309
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,370
safe position check out the next drill
we'll talk about going to control

1310
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,380
we'll talk about going to control
 

1311
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,410
we'll talk about going to control
alright so we've talked now about the

1312
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,420
alright so we've talked now about the
 

1313
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,390
alright so we've talked now about the
safety distances and suppression and

1314
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
safety distances and suppression and
 

1315
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,910
safety distances and suppression and
what he needs to do right so so just to

1316
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:40,920
what he needs to do right so so just to
 

1317
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,950
what he needs to do right so so just to
recap real quick this guy needs to make

1318
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
recap real quick this guy needs to make
 

1319
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,680
recap real quick this guy needs to make
sure that he's never in this close range

1320
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,690
sure that he's never in this close range
 

1321
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,600
sure that he's never in this close range
this close range is bad because my arm

1322
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,610
this close range is bad because my arm
 

1323
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,910
this close range is bad because my arm
will move so fast that I'm likely to get

1324
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:49,920
will move so fast that I'm likely to get
 

1325
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,980
will move so fast that I'm likely to get
a cut on it he wants to always try and

1326
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:51,990
a cut on it he wants to always try and
 

1327
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,890
a cut on it he wants to always try and
keep the distance set to here now if I

1328
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:54,900
keep the distance set to here now if I
 

1329
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,430
keep the distance set to here now if I
were to

1330
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
were to
 

1331
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,529
were to
and he couldn't get his feet out of the

1332
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:57,539
and he couldn't get his feet out of the
 

1333
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,789
and he couldn't get his feet out of the
out of there right so he can't move his

1334
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:58,799
out of there right so he can't move his
 

1335
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,139
out of there right so he can't move his
feet fast enough to move himself out

1336
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:00,149
feet fast enough to move himself out
 

1337
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,600
feet fast enough to move himself out
he's gonna use suppression to stop my

1338
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,610
he's gonna use suppression to stop my
 

1339
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,080
he's gonna use suppression to stop my
knife

1340
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,090
knife
 

1341
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,149
knife
now the second we get suppression if I'm

1342
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,159
now the second we get suppression if I'm
 

1343
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,159
now the second we get suppression if I'm
quicker to act than he is I'm gonna do

1344
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:07,169
quicker to act than he is I'm gonna do
 

1345
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:09,110
quicker to act than he is I'm gonna do
one of three things I'm gonna recover my

1346
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
one of three things I'm gonna recover my
 

1347
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
one of three things I'm gonna recover my
weapon I'm gonna go around his

1348
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,370
weapon I'm gonna go around his
 

1349
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,279
weapon I'm gonna go around his
suppression or I'm gonna drive through

1350
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:13,289
suppression or I'm gonna drive through
 

1351
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:14,869
suppression or I'm gonna drive through
his suppression those are the only three

1352
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:14,879
his suppression those are the only three
 

1353
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,249
his suppression those are the only three
options I have you need to train

1354
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:16,259
options I have you need to train
 

1355
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,139
options I have you need to train
yourself to deal with all three of those

1356
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:18,149
yourself to deal with all three of those
 

1357
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,930
yourself to deal with all three of those
in different ways if I recover his main

1358
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:20,940
in different ways if I recover his main
 

1359
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,639
in different ways if I recover his main
idea is that he wants to get out of

1360
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:22,649
idea is that he wants to get out of
 

1361
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:24,769
idea is that he wants to get out of
there and make distance whenever he does

1362
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:24,779
there and make distance whenever he does
 

1363
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,200
there and make distance whenever he does
that he's gonna say reset so that way we

1364
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,210
that he's gonna say reset so that way we
 

1365
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,090
that he's gonna say reset so that way we
know that he's thinking I need to get

1366
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,100
know that he's thinking I need to get
 

1367
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,649
know that he's thinking I need to get
myself out of here this is a potentially

1368
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:30,659
myself out of here this is a potentially
 

1369
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,009
myself out of here this is a potentially
dangerous situation so now we're gonna

1370
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:34,019
dangerous situation so now we're gonna
 

1371
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,769
dangerous situation so now we're gonna
work with his ability to make control so

1372
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:36,779
work with his ability to make control so
 

1373
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,330
work with his ability to make control so
remember what I said it's it he gets

1374
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,340
remember what I said it's it he gets
 

1375
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,549
remember what I said it's it he gets
suppression and he's first to act he's

1376
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
suppression and he's first to act he's
 

1377
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,169
suppression and he's first to act he's
gonna get control of this knife that's

1378
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:42,179
gonna get control of this knife that's
 

1379
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,730
gonna get control of this knife that's
what he wants to do here because he is

1380
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:43,740
what he wants to do here because he is
 

1381
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,009
what he wants to do here because he is
now got the weapon and I can't do

1382
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:46,019
now got the weapon and I can't do
 

1383
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,539
now got the weapon and I can't do
anything with it I can't use the knife

1384
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:47,549
anything with it I can't use the knife
 

1385
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:49,610
anything with it I can't use the knife
against him at this moment so control is

1386
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:49,620
against him at this moment so control is
 

1387
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,129
against him at this moment so control is
really his goal from suppression before

1388
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:52,139
really his goal from suppression before
 

1389
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,810
really his goal from suppression before
weren't allowing him to get that so that

1390
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:53,820
weren't allowing him to get that so that
 

1391
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,190
weren't allowing him to get that so that
way you can train the skill sets if I

1392
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
way you can train the skill sets if I
 

1393
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,749
way you can train the skill sets if I
have to go around it if I try to go

1394
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:56,759
have to go around it if I try to go
 

1395
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,789
have to go around it if I try to go
through it or if I try to recover now

1396
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
through it or if I try to recover now
 

1397
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
through it or if I try to recover now
we're gonna let him get that control so

1398
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,049
we're gonna let him get that control so
 

1399
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,169
we're gonna let him get that control so
as we go if he gets the control he gets

1400
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,179
as we go if he gets the control he gets
 

1401
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,629
as we go if he gets the control he gets
the control I however I'm also still

1402
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:05,639
the control I however I'm also still
 

1403
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,070
the control I however I'm also still
gonna be working going around the

1404
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,080
gonna be working going around the
 

1405
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,249
gonna be working going around the
suppression through a suppression and

1406
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:09,259
suppression through a suppression and
 

1407
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:11,509
suppression through a suppression and
recovering my weapon we're gonna start

1408
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:11,519
recovering my weapon we're gonna start
 

1409
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,610
recovering my weapon we're gonna start
from a suppression point and now from

1410
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:13,620
from a suppression point and now from
 

1411
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,009
from a suppression point and now from
here once I start it he can get control

1412
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:16,019
here once I start it he can get control
 

1413
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,190
here once I start it he can get control
whenever he wants

1414
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,200
whenever he wants
 

1415
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,779
whenever he wants
reset okay now that was a great example

1416
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:20,789
reset okay now that was a great example
 

1417
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:22,940
reset okay now that was a great example
he went here I pushed down I pulled out

1418
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:22,950
he went here I pushed down I pulled out
 

1419
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,560
he went here I pushed down I pulled out
and recovered my weapons he saw going

1420
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,570
and recovered my weapons he saw going
 

1421
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,639
and recovered my weapons he saw going
into me was a bad idea

1422
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:25,649
into me was a bad idea
 

1423
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:33,450
into me was a bad idea
so he stepped back and reset that

1424
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:33,460

 

1425
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,549

okay now that's another good example he

1426
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
okay now that's another good example he
 

1427
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,620
okay now that's another good example he
managed to get in there lock the note

1428
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:38,630
managed to get in there lock the note
 

1429
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,779
managed to get in there lock the note
nice tight to him and control it so I

1430
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:40,789
nice tight to him and control it so I
 

1431
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,820
nice tight to him and control it so I
couldn't get it free okay from there

1432
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:42,830
couldn't get it free okay from there
 

1433
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,250
couldn't get it free okay from there
we'd work into grappling positions we'll

1434
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,260
we'd work into grappling positions we'll
 

1435
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,750
we'd work into grappling positions we'll
have a video just on grappling so you

1436
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:46,760
have a video just on grappling so you
 

1437
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,519
have a video just on grappling so you
can check that out but getting control

1438
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:48,529
can check that out but getting control
 

1439
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,500
can check that out but getting control
has to happen before the grapple if

1440
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,510
has to happen before the grapple if
 

1441
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,269
has to happen before the grapple if
we're here and Josh doesn't have control

1442
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:52,279
we're here and Josh doesn't have control
 

1443
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,830
we're here and Josh doesn't have control
he goes into grappling maybe he's gonna

1444
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
he goes into grappling maybe he's gonna
 

1445
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,389
he goes into grappling maybe he's gonna
bear hug me or something he's getting

1446
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:55,399
bear hug me or something he's getting
 

1447
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,789
bear hug me or something he's getting
stabbed for all this he cannot afford to

1448
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:57,799
stabbed for all this he cannot afford to
 

1449
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,470
stabbed for all this he cannot afford to
grapple with me unless he first has

1450
00:24:59,470 --> 00:24:59,480
grapple with me unless he first has
 

1451
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,360
grapple with me unless he first has
control of the night so remember our

1452
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,370
control of the night so remember our
 

1453
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,760
control of the night so remember our
hierarchy here right he wants to always

1454
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,770
hierarchy here right he wants to always
 

1455
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,909
hierarchy here right he wants to always
keep me this distance or greater if I

1456
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:06,919
keep me this distance or greater if I
 

1457
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,680
keep me this distance or greater if I
somehow trick him and encroach on this

1458
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:08,690
somehow trick him and encroach on this
 

1459
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,090
somehow trick him and encroach on this
distance he's gonna have to use his

1460
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,100
distance he's gonna have to use his
 

1461
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,789
distance he's gonna have to use his
hands to stop me from cutting him from

1462
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
hands to stop me from cutting him from
 

1463
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,310
hands to stop me from cutting him from
here he suppressed me I'm gonna have if

1464
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,320
here he suppressed me I'm gonna have if
 

1465
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,990
here he suppressed me I'm gonna have if
he's the first act then he'll get

1466
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,000
he's the first act then he'll get
 

1467
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,870
he's the first act then he'll get
control if I'm the first act either I'm

1468
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:19,880
control if I'm the first act either I'm
 

1469
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,029
control if I'm the first act either I'm
gonna go around his weapon and he needs

1470
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:22,039
gonna go around his weapon and he needs
 

1471
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,590
gonna go around his weapon and he needs
her around his suppression and he's

1472
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
her around his suppression and he's
 

1473
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,029
her around his suppression and he's
gonna need drills from that I'm gonna

1474
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
gonna need drills from that I'm gonna
 

1475
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,070
gonna need drills from that I'm gonna
recover my weapon and he needs to know

1476
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,080
recover my weapon and he needs to know
 

1477
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,139
recover my weapon and he needs to know
to reduce sense from that or I'm gonna

1478
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:29,149
to reduce sense from that or I'm gonna
 

1479
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:30,820
to reduce sense from that or I'm gonna
try and drive through with my weapon and

1480
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:30,830
try and drive through with my weapon and
 

1481
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,860
try and drive through with my weapon and
he needs drills for that so now we've

1482
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:32,870
he needs drills for that so now we've
 

1483
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,389
he needs drills for that so now we've
set up all the basic ideas and getting

1484
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:34,399
set up all the basic ideas and getting
 

1485
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,000
set up all the basic ideas and getting
to the control the move to grappling in

1486
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,010
to the control the move to grappling in
 

1487
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,919
to the control the move to grappling in
a bit but we're gonna recap all of this

1488
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:38,929
a bit but we're gonna recap all of this
 

1489
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,269
a bit but we're gonna recap all of this
stuff so you can kind of get a good idea

1490
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:40,279
stuff so you can kind of get a good idea
 

1491
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,299
stuff so you can kind of get a good idea
of it check out the next video okay so

1492
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:43,309
of it check out the next video okay so
 

1493
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,190
of it check out the next video okay so
this is gonna be our recap here at the

1494
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
this is gonna be our recap here at the
 

1495
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
this is gonna be our recap here at the
midway point so there's still lots of

1496
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:46,970
midway point so there's still lots of
 

1497
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,700
midway point so there's still lots of
material to talk about but just to kind

1498
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:48,710
material to talk about but just to kind
 

1499
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,200
material to talk about but just to kind
of reinforce the ideas we've been

1500
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,210
of reinforce the ideas we've been
 

1501
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,159
of reinforce the ideas we've been
talking about and make sure they're

1502
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:51,169
talking about and make sure they're
 

1503
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:54,190
talking about and make sure they're
clear in your mind you can't fight with

1504
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,200
clear in your mind you can't fight with
 

1505
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,649
clear in your mind you can't fight with
a guy with a knife even if you have a

1506
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:56,659
a guy with a knife even if you have a
 

1507
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:58,960
a guy with a knife even if you have a
knife if you have a superior weapon you

1508
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:58,970
knife if you have a superior weapon you
 

1509
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,240
knife if you have a superior weapon you
can fight with them it's really again

1510
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,250
can fight with them it's really again
 

1511
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,320
can fight with them it's really again
not a fight because you have the

1512
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,330
not a fight because you have the
 

1513
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,370
not a fight because you have the
superior weapon so you're gonna be

1514
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:03,380
superior weapon so you're gonna be
 

1515
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,350
superior weapon so you're gonna be
taking charge of that but you really

1516
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
taking charge of that but you really
 

1517
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,700
taking charge of that but you really
can't afford to fight with a knife it's

1518
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:06,710
can't afford to fight with a knife it's
 

1519
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,870
can't afford to fight with a knife it's
dangerous you're gonna get cut a bunch

1520
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:07,880
dangerous you're gonna get cut a bunch
 

1521
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,210
dangerous you're gonna get cut a bunch
it's bad news so what do you do if

1522
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,220
it's bad news so what do you do if
 

1523
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,549
it's bad news so what do you do if
someone has a knife and you don't write

1524
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
someone has a knife and you don't write
 

1525
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,230
someone has a knife and you don't write
the first thing you want to do is make

1526
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
the first thing you want to do is make
 

1527
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,880
the first thing you want to do is make
sure you stay at this distance

1528
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:15,890
sure you stay at this distance
 

1529
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,820
sure you stay at this distance
now this fingertip distance is important

1530
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:18,830
now this fingertip distance is important
 

1531
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,680
now this fingertip distance is important
because without taking a step I can't

1532
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:20,690
because without taking a step I can't
 

1533
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,409
because without taking a step I can't
possibly cut this guy if I take a step

1534
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:23,419
possibly cut this guy if I take a step
 

1535
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,539
possibly cut this guy if I take a step
he's gonna be approximately the same

1536
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:25,549
he's gonna be approximately the same
 

1537
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,130
he's gonna be approximately the same
speed as me and he can take a counter

1538
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,140
speed as me and he can take a counter
 

1539
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,690
speed as me and he can take a counter
step which means he's gonna be well out

1540
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:28,700
step which means he's gonna be well out
 

1541
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,279
step which means he's gonna be well out
of that distance now when he took that

1542
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:30,289
of that distance now when he took that
 

1543
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,070
of that distance now when he took that
counter step notice we again reset to

1544
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,080
counter step notice we again reset to
 

1545
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,779
counter step notice we again reset to
this distance so if he can manage to

1546
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:34,789
this distance so if he can manage to
 

1547
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,220
this distance so if he can manage to
keep me there the whole time and

1548
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,230
keep me there the whole time and
 

1549
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,080
keep me there the whole time and
negotiate what's going on that's best

1550
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,090
negotiate what's going on that's best
 

1551
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,090
negotiate what's going on that's best
for him so if I'm some freak oh and I

1552
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,100
for him so if I'm some freak oh and I
 

1553
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,570
for him so if I'm some freak oh and I
pulled out

1554
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:40,580
pulled out
 

1555
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,490
pulled out
nice somewhere and I'm running around a

1556
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:42,500
nice somewhere and I'm running around a
 

1557
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,200
nice somewhere and I'm running around a
building trying to stab this guy what he

1558
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,210
building trying to stab this guy what he
 

1559
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,580
building trying to stab this guy what he
really should be trying to do is keep

1560
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:45,590
really should be trying to do is keep
 

1561
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,529
really should be trying to do is keep
that fingertip distance right by being

1562
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:47,539
that fingertip distance right by being
 

1563
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,610
that fingertip distance right by being
able to do that

1564
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:48,620
able to do that
 

1565
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,830
able to do that
I can't surprise him all of a sudden now

1566
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:50,840
I can't surprise him all of a sudden now
 

1567
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,810
I can't surprise him all of a sudden now
what happens if I get inside of this

1568
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:52,820
what happens if I get inside of this
 

1569
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
what happens if I get inside of this
distance if I get inside of this

1570
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,350

basic outline now we're gonna move
 

1661
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,850
basic outline now we're gonna move
beyond this so what happens when you're
