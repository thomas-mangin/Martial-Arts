finding them oh but you have to do this
 

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,869
finding them oh but you have to do this
I think that's why if you look at the

38
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
I think that's why if you look at the
 

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,660
I think that's why if you look at the
historical text they didn't answer that

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:15,670
historical text they didn't answer that
 

41

question in academically like we asked

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,310
question in academically like we asked
 

43
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,330
question in academically like we asked
it how do you do it they described it

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,340
it how do you do it they described it
 

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,860
it how do you do it they described it
poetically or we call artistically and I

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:25,870
poetically or we call artistically and I
 

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,740
poetically or we call artistically and I
think a lot of people think that that's

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:28,750
think a lot of people think that that's
 

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,740
think a lot of people think that that's
because it was code when you get out

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,750
because it was code when you get out
 

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,720
because it was code when you get out
I think it was because it was beyond the

you got you got to not be done okay
because tactically the corners of your

186
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,550
because tactically the corners of your
 

187
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,989
because tactically the corners of your
shoulders are weak points they take

188
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:14,999
shoulders are weak points they take
 

189
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,839
shoulders are weak points they take
power away from your strikes so when you

190
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:17,849
power away from your strikes so when you
 

191
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,559
power away from your strikes so when you
hit like this the assumption of power is

hit like this the assumption of power is
 

193
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,129
hit like this the assumption of power is
that it's not going to because you can

that it's not going to because you can
 

195
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,649
that it's not going to because you can
see how much movement there is you see

196
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:27,659
see how much movement there is you see
 

197
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,509
see how much movement there is you see
that not only the rotation of the arm

198
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:29,519
that not only the rotation of the arm
 

199
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,869
that not only the rotation of the arm
but the scapula and then all the ribs so

200
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:32,879
but the scapula and then all the ribs so
 

201
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,929
but the scapula and then all the ribs so
forest is kind of not come back it's got

202
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:35,939
forest is kind of not come back it's got
 

203
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,230
forest is kind of not come back it's got
a hit as the unit boom okay it's just

204
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,240
a hit as the unit boom okay it's just
 

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,839
a hit as the unit boom okay it's just
one solid thing oh so it's not just a

206
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:44,849
one solid thing oh so it's not just a
 

207
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:45,679
one solid thing oh so it's not just a
parlor trick

208
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:45,689
parlor trick
 

209
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,489
parlor trick
it's the body unification test is what

210
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:49,499
it's the body unification test is what
 

211
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,999
it's the body unification test is what
it is so if I if I isolate a muscle

212
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:53,009
it is so if I if I isolate a muscle
 

213
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,279
it is so if I if I isolate a muscle
group which is what I do when I use a

214
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,289
group which is what I do when I use a
 

215
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:59,629
group which is what I do when I use a
muscle group then when I hit something

216
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
muscle group then when I hit something
 

217
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,079
muscle group then when I hit something
or throw something it starts to give way

218
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,089
or throw something it starts to give way
 

219
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,869
or throw something it starts to give way
it start to absorb force it doesn't go

220
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:05,879
it start to absorb force it doesn't go
 

221
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,520
it start to absorb force it doesn't go
into the target okay try to get

222
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,530

 

223
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,430

we're using the those poetics because

224
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
we're using the those poetics because
 

225
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,120
we're using the those poetics because
we've gone over the anatomical position

226
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,130
we've gone over the anatomical position
 

227
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:24,660
we've gone over the anatomical position
we've discussed it a million times I

228
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:24,670

 

229
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,240

just don't think it's the only way of

230
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,250
just don't think it's the only way of
 

231
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,420
just don't think it's the only way of
learning it okay so that's what we're

232
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,430
learning it okay so that's what we're
 

233
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,540
learning it okay so that's what we're
trying this but what we want when up

234
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,550
trying this but what we want when up
 

235
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,820
trying this but what we want when up
when I do this I don't really have a

236
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:36,830
when I do this I don't really have a
 

237
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,300
when I do this I don't really have a
connection okay I don't have a mutual

238
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,310
connection okay I don't have a mutual
 

239
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,740
connection okay I don't have a mutual
relationship either out of a

240
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:41,750
relationship either out of a
 

241
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,190
relationship either out of a
victimization okay so really what I want

242
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
victimization okay so really what I want
 

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
victimization okay so really what I want
to do is reach out so that when I move

244
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,370
to do is reach out so that when I move
 

245
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,940
to do is reach out so that when I move
he he moves I I got a connection going

246
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:51,950
he he moves I I got a connection going
 

247
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,980
he he moves I I got a connection going
you see that and yet it's not

248
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:53,990
you see that and yet it's not
 

249
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,240
you see that and yet it's not
necessarily for fighting but it's a tool

250
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,250
necessarily for fighting but it's a tool
 

251
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,340
necessarily for fighting but it's a tool
that I do use in fight okay the tool is

252
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,350
that I do use in fight okay the tool is
 

253
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,050
that I do use in fight okay the tool is
how do I enter into a relationship with

254
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,060
how do I enter into a relationship with
 

255
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,620
how do I enter into a relationship with
you okay so yeah I can get you into a

256
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:08,630
you okay so yeah I can get you into a
 

257
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,090
you okay so yeah I can get you into a
relationship with my techniques like

258
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,100
relationship with my techniques like
 

259
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,800
relationship with my techniques like
this

260
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,810
this
 

261
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,260
this
he's not moving when I'm moving hey a

262
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,270
he's not moving when I'm moving hey a
 

263
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,860
he's not moving when I'm moving hey a
cure I already have established this

264
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:17,870
cure I already have established this
 

265
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,990
cure I already have established this
where we're one so when I move he moves

266
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,000
where we're one so when I move he moves

those on then punched in them
 

289
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,790
those on then punched in them
okay they were not training so same

290
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
okay they were not training so same
 

291
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,380

thing goes when he goes on with the
 

293
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,160
thing goes when he goes on with the
technique I have that same relationship

294
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,170
technique I have that same relationship
 

295
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,920
technique I have that same relationship
with it's not he goes yeah yeah broke

296
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:30,930
with it's not he goes yeah yeah broke
 

297
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,810
with it's not he goes yeah yeah broke
broke so he's training for it I'm

298
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:35,820
broke so he's training for it I'm
 

299
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,690

fighting architecture it's a cultivation

302
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
fighting architecture it's a cultivation
 

303
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:55,410
fighting architecture it's a cultivation
of a skill okay so

304
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:55,420

 

305
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,330

when I grab in safety I don't drop them

306
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,340
when I grab in safety I don't drop them
 

307
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:05,190
when I grab in safety I don't drop them
tiny I drop on the baby

308
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200

 

309
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:14,250

let's go so again big hit the connection

310
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:14,260
let's go so again big hit the connection
 

311
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,760
let's go so again big hit the connection
boom connection ok I'm in the same thing

312
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:18,770
boom connection ok I'm in the same thing
 

313
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,890
boom connection ok I'm in the same thing
so as I'm here I'm going to take that

314
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:20,900
so as I'm here I'm going to take that
 

315
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:33,300
so as I'm here I'm going to take that
same dynamic stillness and now move it

316
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,310

 

317
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:48,850

big boom ok and then big wherever you're

318
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:48,860
big boom ok and then big wherever you're
 

319
00:11:48,860 --> 00:12:42,470
big boom ok and then big wherever you're
touching it doesn't matter right

320
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480

 

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,699

as as I go on because that was where the

322
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:47,709
as as I go on because that was where the
 

323
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,780
as as I go on because that was where the
throw was right then I can hit him and

324
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:51,790
throw was right then I can hit him and
 

325
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,860
throw was right then I can hit him and
he won't be there I'll touch him but I

326
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:55,870
he won't be there I'll touch him but I
 

327
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,180
he won't be there I'll touch him but I
won't break his ribs okay so I have the

328
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,190
won't break his ribs okay so I have the
 

329
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,750
won't break his ribs okay so I have the
same body relationship to the ground to

330
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
same body relationship to the ground to
 

331
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,790
same body relationship to the ground to
my internal structure and I create a

332
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:05,800
my internal structure and I create a
 

333
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
my internal structure and I create a
relationship with him

334
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:06,970
relationship with him
 

335
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,829
relationship with him
boom then I'm going to use it to move

336
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:10,839
boom then I'm going to use it to move
 

337
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,090
boom then I'm going to use it to move
him well and now I'm going to use the

338
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,100
him well and now I'm going to use the
 

339
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,829
him well and now I'm going to use the
tune in to and I can throw pretty good

340
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
tune in to and I can throw pretty good
 

341
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,180
tune in to and I can throw pretty good
with that structure because he's not

342
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,190
with that structure because he's not
 

343
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,910
with that structure because he's not
really there because he got projected

344
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
really there because he got projected
 

345
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,650
really there because he got projected
out by the bottom man you guys

346
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:25,660
out by the bottom man you guys
 

347
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,170
out by the bottom man you guys
understand boom so all you people who

348
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:31,180
understand boom so all you people who
 

349
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,660
understand boom so all you people who
then show arm collapse you're not gonna

350
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:33,670
then show arm collapse you're not gonna
 

351
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,300

like that technique because that means

352
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,310
like that technique because that means
 

353
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,829
like that technique because that means
that I'm getting close to deal with the

354
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
that I'm getting close to deal with the
 

355
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:55,990
that I'm getting close to deal with the
punch

356
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000

 

357
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,140

I'm rejecting him he just has a vested

359
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,330
I'm rejecting him he just has a vested
interest in keeping that check so you

360
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:02,340
interest in keeping that check so you
 

361
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
interest in keeping that check so you
don't get any more projection if he

362
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,350
don't get any more projection if he
 

363
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,440
don't get any more projection if he
lifts his arm and he'll drag the

364
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,450
lifts his arm and he'll drag the
 

365
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,080
lifts his arm and he'll drag the
projection of Cooper do you understand

366
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,090
projection of Cooper do you understand
 

367
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,560
projection of Cooper do you understand
but then we're not training okay so I'm
