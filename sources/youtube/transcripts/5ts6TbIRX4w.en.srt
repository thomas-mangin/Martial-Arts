I'm going to stand on the line I'm going
 

167
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,190
I'm going to stand on the line I'm going
to put it here and then I'm going to

168
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
to put it here and then I'm going to
 

169
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,869
to put it here and then I'm going to
flow it over here

170
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
flow it over here
 

171
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,210
flow it over here
I might move about quite a lot because

172
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,220
I might move about quite a lot because
 

173
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,670
I might move about quite a lot because
it depends where I have to be

174
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
it depends where I have to be
 

175
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,589
it depends where I have to be
to get that

176
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
to get that
 

177
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,929
to get that
all right

178
00:03:58,929 --> 00:03:58,939
all right
 

179
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:05,570
all right
all right and then you apply the power

180
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:05,580

 

181
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,449

okay

182
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:10,459

 

183
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,990

this one

184
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000

 

185
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,729

you know you've seen this and then the

186
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:16,739
you know you've seen this and then the
 

187
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,349
you know you've seen this and then the
great thing is there's lots of videos

188
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:18,359
great thing is there's lots of videos
 

189
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,069
great thing is there's lots of videos
out there

190
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079

 

191
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,890

take that leg and you do a little bunny

192
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:24,900
take that leg and you do a little bunny
 

193
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,469
take that leg and you do a little bunny
hop back

194
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:27,479
hop back
 

195
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,810
hop back
they're all Joe nagis not what we're

196
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:29,820
they're all Joe nagis not what we're
 

197
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,170
they're all Joe nagis not what we're
doing okay so Joe Dory

198
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,180

 

199
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,330

 same thing everything is the same

200
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
same thing everything is the same
 

201
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,969
same thing everything is the same
thing take it don't make a big movement

202
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:40,979
thing take it don't make a big movement
 

203
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,430
thing take it don't make a big movement
this isn't going to happen

204
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
this isn't going to happen
 

205
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,430
this isn't going to happen
what take a small one

206
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:46,440
what take a small one
 

207
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,469
what take a small one
here

208
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
here
 

209
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,110
here
step in here and then hit him with that

210
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
step in here and then hit him with that
 

211
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,430
step in here and then hit him with that
there

212
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
there
 

213
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,689
there
all right so that's basic mechanics

214
00:04:58,689 --> 00:04:58,699

 

215
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:06,650

okay try this one please don't

216
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:06,660

 

217
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,409

you can add the attemi or not add the

218
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
you can add the attemi or not add the
 

219
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,170
you can add the attemi or not add the
atemi

220
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,180

 

221
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,129

okay

222
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:13,139
okay
 

223
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,950
okay
so it's good to know where the attemis

224
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:15,960
so it's good to know where the attemis
 

225
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,110
so it's good to know where the attemis
are going you know

226
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,120
are going you know
 

227
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,129
are going you know
one's in here where where it hurts and

228
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:22,139
one's in here where where it hurts and
 

229
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,010
one's in here where where it hurts and
now the ones just there

230
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
now the ones just there
 

231
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,070
now the ones just there
all right

232
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080

 

233
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,890

so once you've taken them on not on the

234
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:30,900
so once you've taken them on not on the
 

235
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,629
so once you've taken them on not on the
Block pointing thrown with the Joe but

236
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
Block pointing thrown with the Joe but
 

237
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,629
Block pointing thrown with the Joe but
anyhow so since he would go hey

238
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639

 

239
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,749

the bit that people get wrong

240
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
the bit that people get wrong
 

241
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,430
the bit that people get wrong
or where they struggle is hey here you

242
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,440
or where they struggle is hey here you
 

243
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,129
or where they struggle is hey here you
can do but when they take this now

244
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,139
can do but when they take this now
 

245
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:55,309
can do but when they take this now
well they take this has to power up

246
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:55,319
well they take this has to power up
 

247
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,770
well they take this has to power up
against his elbow

248
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:57,780
against his elbow
 

249
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,990
against his elbow
okay if you get it wrong and it goes up

250
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
okay if you get it wrong and it goes up
 

251
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,550
okay if you get it wrong and it goes up
under his armpit

252
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,560
under his armpit
 

253
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,770
under his armpit
he can either put his weight down on you

254
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:03,780
he can either put his weight down on you
 

255
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,930
he can either put his weight down on you
or you can't throw them

256
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:05,940
or you can't throw them
 

257
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,590
or you can't throw them
so that circumference is very similar to

258
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
so that circumference is very similar to
 

259
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,170
so that circumference is very similar to
what we were doing with the uh Ken this

260
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,180
what we were doing with the uh Ken this
 

261
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,749
what we were doing with the uh Ken this
morning hey

262
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:16,759

 

263
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,129

and because they're pinned up there

264
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
and because they're pinned up there
 

265
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,529
and because they're pinned up there
they're happy to be thrown usually

266
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:21,539
they're happy to be thrown usually
 

267
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,270
they're happy to be thrown usually
anyhow

268
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
anyhow
 

269
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,290
anyhow
foreign

270
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,300

foreign
so the weakness will be that you're

272
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:26,699
so the weakness will be that you're
 

273
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,029
so the weakness will be that you're
going if you don't do the atemi what

274
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
going if you don't do the atemi what
 

275
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,830
going if you don't do the atemi what
people do is if they get in because they

276
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:30,840
people do is if they get in because they
 

277
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,689
people do is if they get in because they
want to throw they get it and they try

278
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:32,699
want to throw they get it and they try
 

279
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,909
want to throw they get it and they try
and lift without

280
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:34,919
and lift without
 

281
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,710
and lift without
powering that up

282
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
powering that up
 

283
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,529
powering that up
you can't power out now

284
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
you can't power out now
 

285
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,809
you can't power out now
so hence that's why the attempt is

286
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:41,819
so hence that's why the attempt is
 

287
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,430
so hence that's why the attempt is
important but you roll that wrist round

288
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,440
important but you roll that wrist round
 

289
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,010
important but you roll that wrist round
to get the pitch so a temmie

290
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,020

 

291
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,150

hey

292
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,160
hey
 

293
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,160
