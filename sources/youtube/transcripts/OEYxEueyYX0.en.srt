00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,380

so

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,390
so
 

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,510
so
two ways of moving one is that my body

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,520
two ways of moving one is that my body
 

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,420
two ways of moving one is that my body
is kind of independent that's the

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,430
is kind of independent that's the
 

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,510
is kind of independent that's the
problem my body is independent of what

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
problem my body is independent of what
 

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,679

not seeing okay so this is an obvious
 

485
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,859
not seeing okay so this is an obvious
example my body is totally unrelated

you're doing the gross thing do what

498
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:53,879
you're doing the gross thing do what
 

499
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:58,220
you're doing the gross thing do what
it's doing okay so we he's pushing and I

500
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,230
it's doing okay so we he's pushing and I
 

501
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,710
it's doing okay so we he's pushing and I
want to task myself with lifting the

want to task myself with lifting the
 

503
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,889
want to task myself with lifting the
hand again so if you watch right there's

504
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:03,899
hand again so if you watch right there's
 

505
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,369
hand again so if you watch right there's
going to be a weight shift there's going

506
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:07,379
going to be a weight shift there's going
 

507
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,580
going to be a weight shift there's going
to be a knee bend just going to be a

508
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:10,590
to be a knee bend just going to be a
 

509
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,440
to be a knee bend just going to be a
pelvic tilt there's going to be a kind

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
of coiling in that elbow will move in
 

513
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,830
of coiling in that elbow will move in
the laughs we'll move forward and in and

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
the laughs we'll move forward and in and
 

515
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,190
the laughs we'll move forward and in and
there the back is going to stretch in

516
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
there the back is going to stretch in
 

517
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,539
there the back is going to stretch in
the upper part of my body because I have

518
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:29,549
the upper part of my body because I have
 

519
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,330
the upper part of my body because I have
to inhale before I can exhale okay so

520
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,340
to inhale before I can exhale okay so
 

521
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,149
to inhale before I can exhale okay so
he's pushing and you look for this so

522
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:35,159
he's pushing and you look for this so
 

523
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,769
he's pushing and you look for this so
they're deep in the weight shift the

524
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:36,779
they're deep in the weight shift the
 

525
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,369
they're deep in the weight shift the
pelvis oh and once you have the yen cool

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:09,179
when the back foot is flying around like
 

539
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:17,480
when the back foot is flying around like
that you're not doing okay

541
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:24,570

so here we go p skis all right back foot

542
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:24,580
so here we go p skis all right back foot
 

543
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,159
so here we go p skis all right back foot

would have happened watch it again see

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,230
would have happened watch it again see
 

547
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,560
would have happened watch it again see
that so the back foot could not act as

the gravity pulls you in and when you
 

631
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,160
the gravity pulls you in and when you
get pulled in you lose awareness of the
