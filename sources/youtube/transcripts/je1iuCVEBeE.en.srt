00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,669

from a marshall point of view you start

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
from a marshall point of view you start
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,430
from a marshall point of view you start
doing weird things

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440

 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,790

but they don't feel weird to you because

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
but they don't feel weird to you because
 

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,269
but they don't feel weird to you because
you don't know the martial context you

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
you don't know the martial context you
 

13
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,310
you don't know the martial context you
can't

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
can't
 

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,109
can't
imagine all the things that an aggressor

16
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
imagine all the things that an aggressor
 

17
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,269
imagine all the things that an aggressor
can do to you

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
can do to you
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,589
can do to you
so you don't know when you deviate from

20
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
so you don't know when you deviate from
 

21
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,269
so you don't know when you deviate from
the form

22
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
the form
 

23
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,389
the form
that you are partially vulnerable

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
that you are partially vulnerable
 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,790
that you are partially vulnerable
there's no context for your movement

26
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
there's no context for your movement
 

27
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,110
there's no context for your movement
and the only thing you have to rely on

28
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
and the only thing you have to rely on
 

29
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,030
and the only thing you have to rely on
is your capacity

30
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
is your capacity
 

31
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,310
is your capacity
to replicate the teacher's form

32
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
to replicate the teacher's form
 

33
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,830
to replicate the teacher's form
but that's nearly impossible

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
but that's nearly impossible
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,389
but that's nearly impossible
it's it's and i'm not talking about your

36
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
it's it's and i'm not talking about your
 

37
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,150
it's it's and i'm not talking about your
body is different from your teacher's

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
body is different from your teacher's
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,670

body
 

41
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,389
body
that's that's not what it is that you

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
that's that's not what it is that you
 

43
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,430
that's that's not what it is that you
see

44
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
see
 

45
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,950
see
the technique from the ego tripartite

46
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
the technique from the ego tripartite
 

47
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,950
the technique from the ego tripartite
it is constantly being interpreted

48
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
it is constantly being interpreted
 

49
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,750
it is constantly being interpreted
and placed in your own egocentric

50
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
and placed in your own egocentric
 

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,710
and placed in your own egocentric
context so

52
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
context so
 

53
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,270
context so
it's placed in the context that

54
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
it's placed in the context that
 

55
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,070
it's placed in the context that
redefines

56
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
redefines
 

57
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,670
redefines
the eye and so

58
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
the eye and so
 

59
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,510
the eye and so
the art is outside of the ego tripartite

60
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
the art is outside of the ego tripartite
 

61
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,390
the art is outside of the ego tripartite
so that

62
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
so that
 

63
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,550
so that
deviation is always that it's always a

64
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
deviation is always that it's always a
 

65
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,670
deviation is always that it's always a
deviation

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680

 

67
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,429

so you can either take

68
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
so you can either take
 

69
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,550
so you can either take
decades of

70
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
decades of

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,350
decades of
entering yourself into sparring context

72
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
entering yourself into sparring context
 

73
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,390
entering yourself into sparring context
where you realize

74
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
where you realize
 

75
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,590
where you realize
oh god my head's too low or oh

i shouldn't be going forward right now
um

um
 

83
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,109

understanding the martial context

94
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
understanding the martial context
 

95
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,389
understanding the martial context
it's very important that you understand

96
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
it's very important that you understand
 

97
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,389
it's very important that you understand
the martial context because

98
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
the martial context because
 

99
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,790
the martial context because
you're going to fill in the blank just

100
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
you're going to fill in the blank just
 

101
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,869
you're going to fill in the blank just
automatically you always will

102
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
automatically you always will
 

103
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,470
automatically you always will
you will fill in that blank that context

104
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
you will fill in that blank that context
 

105
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,110
you will fill in that blank that context
without the marshall experience it's

106
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
without the marshall experience it's
 

107
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,949
without the marshall experience it's
going to be wrong

108
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
going to be wrong
 

109
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,350
going to be wrong
it's going to be a deviation from the

110
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
it's going to be a deviation from the
 

111
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,630
it's going to be a deviation from the
get-go anyways it's going to be wrong

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
so you are working on that you do have
 

175
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,589
so you are working on that you do have
an angle cancellation on that arm you

176
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
an angle cancellation on that arm you
 

177
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,390
an angle cancellation on that arm you
have to understand

178
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
have to understand
 

179
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,430
have to understand
basic concepts of checking the guy out

180
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
basic concepts of checking the guy out
 

181
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,270
basic concepts of checking the guy out

height width and depth
and then you also have this notion of

186
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
and then you also have this notion of
 

187
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,070
and then you also have this notion of

using this
 

273
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,710
using this
picture move that he has here and the

274
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
picture move that he has here and the

and it was that that lets me

286
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
and it was that that lets me
 

287

so i don't have to do this arm

292
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
so i don't have to do this arm
 

293
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,189
so i don't have to do this arm
manipulation

294
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
manipulation
 

295
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,589
manipulation
if i am required to do the arm

296
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
if i am required to do the arm
 

297
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,189
if i am required to do the arm
manipulation

manipulation
 

299
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,150
manipulation
that means i need to control his arms

300
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
that means i need to control his arms
 

301
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,670
that means i need to control his arms

and that only makes sense to somebody
 

305
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,629
and that only makes sense to somebody
who does not train combatively

306
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
who does not train combatively
 

307
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,070

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
you are arm dependent and your martial
 

345
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,790
you are arm dependent and your martial
viability is going way down

346
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
viability is going way down
 

347
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,710
viability is going way down
and that's not the strategy the strategy

348
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
and that's not the strategy the strategy
 

349
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,390
and that's not the strategy the strategy
as i said is to manipulate the

350
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
as i said is to manipulate the
 

351
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,150
as i said is to manipulate the
relationship between his center of

352
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
relationship between his center of
 

353
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
relationship between his center of
gravity his line of gravity and his base

354
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
gravity his line of gravity and his base
 

355
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,110
gravity his line of gravity and his base
of support

356
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
of support
 

357
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,629
of support
not to manipulate his arm

358
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
not to manipulate his arm
 

359
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,950
not to manipulate his arm
so when we go to this technique

360
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
so when we go to this technique
 

361
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,790
so when we go to this technique
this is the same thing you have to have

362
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
this is the same thing you have to have
 

363
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,309
this is the same thing you have to have
that ik adhesion there

364
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
that ik adhesion there
 

365
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,909
that ik adhesion there
you're not thrift dependent

366
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919

 

367
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,189

but on the other arm here you don't have

368
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
but on the other arm here you don't have
 

369
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,830
but on the other arm here you don't have
it

370
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
it
 

371
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,230
it
at all you don't you don't grab them

372
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
at all you don't you don't grab them
 

373
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,430
at all you don't you don't grab them
you're doing the same life

374
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
you're doing the same life
 

375
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,510
you're doing the same life
adhesion

376
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520

 

377
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,709

so i deletion adhesions

378
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719

 

379
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,430

and then i go back to the same thing

380
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
and then i go back to the same thing
 

381
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,670
and then i go back to the same thing
just two points of control

382
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
just two points of control
 

383
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,430
just two points of control
but not grabbing not opening

384
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
but not grabbing not opening
 

385
00:08:45,440 --> 00:09:02,230
but not grabbing not opening
from back here

386
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240

 

387
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:20,829

that was it you worked the drone

388
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

389
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,269

girl

390
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279

 

391
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,990

this part here is another thing you're

392
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
this part here is another thing you're
 

393
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,829
this part here is another thing you're
trying to learn

394
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
trying to learn
 

395
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,790
trying to learn
but it's not that first strategy

396
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
but it's not that first strategy
 

397
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,150
but it's not that first strategy
how do i clear the stuff between him and

398
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
how do i clear the stuff between him and
 

399
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,630
how do i clear the stuff between him and
me

400
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
me
 

401
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,750
me
what stuff his limbs how do i get past

402
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
what stuff his limbs how do i get past
 

403
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,710
what stuff his limbs how do i get past
his limbs

404
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
his limbs
 

405
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,070
his limbs
and get to spinal control okay

406
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
and get to spinal control okay
 

407
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,590
and get to spinal control okay
try it again okay so uh again

408
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
try it again okay so uh again
 

409
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,790
try it again okay so uh again
this is i'm moving one

410
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
this is i'm moving one
 

411
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,230
this is i'm moving one
two head one two head

412
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
two head one two head
 

413
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,910
two head one two head
one two head okay that's that's the idea

414
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
one two head okay that's that's the idea
 

415
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,269
one two head okay that's that's the idea
so that means that when i bring him here

416
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
so that means that when i bring him here
 

417
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,550
so that means that when i bring him here
this hand is going to continue him going

418
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
this hand is going to continue him going
 

419
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,269
this hand is going to continue him going
with that adhesion

420
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279

 

421
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,310

it's not here he stopped and then

422
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
it's not here he stopped and then
 

423
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,670
it's not here he stopped and then
i go behind him because again

424
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
i go behind him because again
 

425
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,269
i go behind him because again
if you fought people you'd realize

426
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
if you fought people you'd realize
 

427
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,389
if you fought people you'd realize
going this is not the opening the 12

going this is not the opening the 12
 

429
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,269
going this is not the opening the 12
6 line is not the opening several things

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
6 line is not the opening several things
 

431
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:29,829
6 line is not the opening several things
happen

00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
happen
 

433
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,670
happen
okay either forget the wrist grab

434
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
okay either forget the wrist grab
 

435
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,190
okay either forget the wrist grab
because it was never about a wrist

436
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
because it was never about a wrist

and i'm going that way we're going to
 

443
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,550
and i'm going that way we're going to
pass each other

444
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
pass each other
 

445
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,790
pass each other
okay or he's going that way

446
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
okay or he's going that way
 

447
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,310
okay or he's going that way
i don't necessarily pass him but now

448
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
i don't necessarily pass him but now
 

449
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,230
i don't necessarily pass him but now
i'm going to be fighting his forward

450
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
i'm going to be fighting his forward
 

451
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,790
i'm going to be fighting his forward
progress okay and again

452
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
progress okay and again
 

453
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,949
progress okay and again
if you don't ever fight you don't

454
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
if you don't ever fight you don't
 

455
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,030
if you don't ever fight you don't
realize you can't just grab people from

456
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
realize you can't just grab people from
 

457
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,630
realize you can't just grab people from
the back of their body and chuck them

458
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
the back of their body and chuck them
 

459
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,269
the back of their body and chuck them
down

460
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
down
 

461
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,790
down
okay

462
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800

 

463
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,230

so you want to look for

464
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
so you want to look for
 

465
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,470
so you want to look for
one more adhesion and now partially

466
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
one more adhesion and now partially
 

467
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,790
one more adhesion and now partially
you've set up the eevee angle

468
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
you've set up the eevee angle
 

469
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,310
you've set up the eevee angle
which is not at the 12 6 line but

470
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
which is not at the 12 6 line but
 

471
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,790
which is not at the 12 6 line but
at the 3 9 line okay

472
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
at the 3 9 line okay
 

473
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,590
at the 3 9 line okay
so interest yourself with setting up

474
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
so interest yourself with setting up
 

475
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,230
so interest yourself with setting up
this three

476
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
this three
 

477
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,509
this three
nine line and then you'll probably

478
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
nine line and then you'll probably
 

479
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,790
nine line and then you'll probably
interest yourself with

480
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
interest yourself with
 

481
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,389
interest yourself with
actually doing the first marshall tactic

482
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
actually doing the first marshall tactic
 

483
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,389
actually doing the first marshall tactic
pass him to the other hand as opposed to

484
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
pass him to the other hand as opposed to
 

485
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,310
pass him to the other hand as opposed to
check him and then you're going to do

486
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
check him and then you're going to do
 

487
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,470
check him and then you're going to do
this he should still be going

488
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
this he should still be going
 

489
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,310
this he should still be going
forward he goes forward

490
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
forward he goes forward
 

491
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,350
forward he goes forward
into the technique

492
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360

 

493
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:12,550

going forward

494
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560

 

495
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,949

try to get that three-nine line for your

496
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
try to get that three-nine line for your
 

497
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,150
try to get that three-nine line for your
entry

498
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160

 

499
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,069

the next marshall skill

500
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
the next marshall skill
 

501
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,590
the next marshall skill
is once i've passed his uh spinal

502
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
is once i've passed his uh spinal
 

503
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,910
is once i've passed his uh spinal
spinal control to my other hand

504
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
spinal control to my other hand
 

505
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,350
spinal control to my other hand
is how to manipulate

506
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
is how to manipulate
 

507
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,430
is how to manipulate
the distal end of the lever so it's

508
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
the distal end of the lever so it's
 

509
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,670
the distal end of the lever so it's
distal because it's far from his center

510
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
distal because it's far from his center
 

511
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,350
distal because it's far from his center
of gravity okay

512
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
of gravity okay
 

513
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,550
of gravity okay
but how to manipulate the distal animal

that
 

553
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,670

so that that makes this one wrong

554
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680

 

555
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,710

and getting his

576
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
and getting his

583
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:26,870

so one two four

584
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880

 

585
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,470

and that way this arm is does not become

and that way this arm is does not become
 

591
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,910

let's just look at this arms okay so

626
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
let's just look at this arms okay so
 

627
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,189
let's just look at this arms okay so
his he has the um

628
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
his he has the um
 

629
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,269
his he has the um
hinge at the elbow and he and then he

630
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
hinge at the elbow and he and then he
 

631
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,189
hinge at the elbow and he and then he
has his ball socket joint

632
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
has his ball socket joint
 

633
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,949
has his ball socket joint
at his shoulder okay and so

634
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
at his shoulder okay and so
 

635
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,389
at his shoulder okay and so
uh when when you're below the elbow

636
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
uh when when you're below the elbow
 

637
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,550
uh when when you're below the elbow
and you try to control him it's very

638
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
and you try to control him it's very
 

639
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,990
and you try to control him it's very
easy for him

640
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
easy for him
 

641
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,550

to open his arm you see he absorbs the

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
to open his arm you see he absorbs the
 

643
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,030
to open his arm you see he absorbs the

644
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
energy that you had checking him
 

645
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,629

and then the same thing when i go uh

646
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
and then the same thing when i go uh
 

647
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,550
and then the same thing when i go uh
above the elbow but i'm on top of his

648
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
above the elbow but i'm on top of his
 

649
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,269
above the elbow but i'm on top of his
arm the ball and socket joint

659
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,030

and then uh near the ball and socket

662
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320

i try to get back here
 

865
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,669
i try to get back here
because you can't get back there as you

866
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
because you can't get back there as you
 

867

okay so uh as we go
this is going like that but everything

872
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
this is going like that but everything
 

873
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,990
this is going like that but everything
can shrink now

874
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
can shrink now
 

875
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,029

okay everything kind of shrinks but

880
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
okay everything kind of shrinks but
 

881
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,710
okay everything kind of shrinks but
everything stays the same

882
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
