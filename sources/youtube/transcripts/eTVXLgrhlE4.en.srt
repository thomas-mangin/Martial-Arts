you're working on and you are working on

14
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359
you're working on and you are working on
 

15
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,509
you're working on and you are working on
on standing but it works it's easier to

16
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:22,519
on standing but it works it's easier to
 

17
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,910
on standing but it works it's easier to
work it or it's there better drill for

18
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:24,920
work it or it's there better drill for
 

19
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,349
work it or it's there better drill for
more efficient drill to work it seated

20
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
more efficient drill to work it seated
 

21
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,109
more efficient drill to work it seated
so again in the Chinese internal Arts is

22
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
so again in the Chinese internal Arts is
 

23
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,270
so again in the Chinese internal Arts is
called the qua and I'm just going to

24
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
called the qua and I'm just going to
 

25
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,510
called the qua and I'm just going to
keep it simple it's this pelvis area

26
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,520
keep it simple it's this pelvis area
 

27
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,430
keep it simple it's this pelvis area
okay for now and what it's not it's not

28
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:40,440
okay for now and what it's not it's not
 

29

hole like
 

43
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,709
hole like
this I don't do that if you pay

44
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:01,719
this I don't do that if you pay
 

45
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,509
this I don't do that if you pay
attention the hip is actually going the

46
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:04,519
attention the hip is actually going the
 

47
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,270
attention the hip is actually going the
other

48
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,280
other
 

49
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,630
other
way this

50
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
way this
 

51
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,149
way this
way I don't go like

52
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
way I don't go like
 

53
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,710
way I don't go like
this

54
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:13,720
this
 

55
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,270
this
so we'll take yesterday's

56
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
so we'll take yesterday's
 

57
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,390
so we'll take yesterday's
technique and for now I want you to

58
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
technique and for now I want you to
 

59
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,749
technique and for now I want you to
imagine a few physiological points one

60
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
imagine a few physiological points one
 

61
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,069
imagine a few physiological points one
is this hip

62
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:24,079
is this hip
 

63
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,350
is this hip
crease you're you're always going to

64
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,360
crease you're you're always going to
 

65
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,069
crease you're you're always going to
close one as close one as you open the

66
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
close one as close one as you open the
 

67
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,830
close one as close one as you open the
other close one open the other another

68
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
other close one open the other another
 

69
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,510
other close one open the other another
one is another key point is this one

70
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
one is another key point is this one
 

71
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,709
one is another key point is this one
going this way never wrap up my stomach

72
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:45,719
going this way never wrap up my stomach
 

73
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,709
going this way never wrap up my stomach
okay not at my waist it's lower W here

74
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:49,719
okay not at my waist it's lower W here
 

75
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,350
okay not at my waist it's lower W here
and then the third one is like your

76
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,360
and then the third one is like your
 

77
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,510
and then the third one is like your
tailbone or your Center gravity dropping

78
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
tailbone or your Center gravity dropping
 

79
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,630
tailbone or your Center gravity dropping
through dropping through to the bottom

80
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640
through dropping through to the bottom
 

81
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,029
through dropping through to the bottom
dropping through the bottom there okay

82
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:00,039
dropping through the bottom there okay
 

83
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,670
dropping through the bottom there okay
so we do that technique yesterday right

84
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
so we do that technique yesterday right
 

85
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,230
so we do that technique yesterday right
so we go

86
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,240
so we go
 

87
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,070
so we go
back and the first one you can see it's

88
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,080
back and the first one you can see it's
 

89
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,790
back and the first one you can see it's
ever so slight I not here like
