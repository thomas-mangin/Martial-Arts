1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,510
Master Christian Tissier.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,649
This is to certify that Christian Tissier

3
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,276
is awarded the 8th Dan in Aikido.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,612
Made on the 10th of January 2016,

5
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,739
Aikido Doshu Ueshiba Moriteru.

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,603
What does this 8th Dan mean to you?

7
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,648
8th, Dan is a great honor

8
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,191
I am delighted.

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,444
It's the product of a very long journey

10
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:15,200
since it represents more than 55 years of Aikido,

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,371
but at same time, it's the beginning of a new responsibility,

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,623
for myself, for my students.

13
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:27,379
but also for what I represent with respect to the Aikikai.

14
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,090
What I want to add is...

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,763
the 8th Dan is the same grade as that of the most prestigious masters,

16
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:42,477
but on my side, I still have the soul of a kid, and that feels strange.

17
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,897
I still feel like a kid of Aikido

18
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,026
so I take this with a lot of humility

19
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,529
and a lot of gratefulness towards Doshu

20
00:01:52,529 --> 00:02:00,746
who on the one hand may be giving the 8th Dan to a non-Japanese for the first time,

21
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,998
and on the other hand,

22
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:09,171
this 8th Dan coincides with that of Miyamoto Shihan

23
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:14,926
who received his 7th Dan at same time as me in 1998.

24
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,804
There has been no national preference

25
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:24,227
and I find this very good and quite valorizing for me.

26
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:35,489
Doshu, Dojo-cho, Tada Sensei, all the Sensei, thank you very much.

27
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:44,915
I entered Hombu Dojo 47 years ago

28
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:54,174
and since that time, I have always been faithful to the Ueshiba family.

29
00:02:54,174 --> 00:03:01,056
From today, and tomorrow, I will continue to give my very best for Aikido.

30
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,016
Thank you very much.

31
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:11,650
What does it represent for the people who avail themselves of your "line"?

32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,445
There is no Tissier "line" in terms of an organization.

33
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,533
The fact is that I am a product of the Aikikai.

34
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:24,621
This 8th Dan proves that I am totally in the line of the Aikikai.

35
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,669
I didn't want to create groups in around the world such as the Birankai or that of Yamda Sensei.

36
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,506
A number of people who claim to follow my teaching

37
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:39,553
decided to call that the "Tissier line"

38
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,264
That's how it started, and it doesn't originate from me.
