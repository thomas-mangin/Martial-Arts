his shoulder right you cancel all that
 

171
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:54,230
his shoulder right you cancel all that
out so the technique is not this and

172
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
out so the technique is not this and
 

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,790
out so the technique is not this and
then I shove him down

174

then I shove him down
 

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,300
then I shove him down
the technique is on continue with the

he's falling down and I'm following this
 

183
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,749
he's falling down and I'm following this
and that only happens if you're on the

184
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
and that only happens if you're on the
 

185
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,930
and that only happens if you're on the
knife edge of the hat anywhere else it

186
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:18,940
knife edge of the hat anywhere else it
 

187

so if I have in lefthand and I was doing

642
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,200
so if I have in lefthand and I was doing
 

643
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,970
so if I have in lefthand and I was doing
this motion you see that the turn that

644
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:17,980
this motion you see that the turn that
 

645
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,540
this motion you see that the turn that
man scepter left hand was over here if

646
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,550
man scepter left hand was over here if
 

647
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,580
man scepter left hand was over here if
their left hand is over here you're not

648
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,590
their left hand is over here you're not
 

649
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,620
their left hand is over here you're not
getting there okay

650
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:25,630
getting there okay
 

651
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,590
getting there okay
do you understand that much so I don't

652
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
do you understand that much so I don't
 

653
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
do you understand that much so I don't
care how many years you've done it that

654
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:30,610
care how many years you've done it that
 

655
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,270
care how many years you've done it that
way that's why we're doing the class

656
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
way that's why we're doing the class
 

657
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,780
way that's why we're doing the class
that way does not work that way does not

658
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:36,790
that way does not work that way does not
 

659
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,130
that way does not work that way does not
train so everything has to go into that

660
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,140
train so everything has to go into that
 

661
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,990
train so everything has to go into that
I don't have to ever be like this so

662
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't have to ever be like this so
 

663
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,330
I don't have to ever be like this so
that I have to go like that so be strong

664
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,340
that I have to go like that so be strong
 

665
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,520
that I have to go like that so be strong
not going to work okay so we'll just

666
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,530
not going to work okay so we'll just
 

667
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,340
not going to work okay so we'll just
have the guy lie down and then you get

668
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,350
have the guy lie down and then you get
 

669
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,910
have the guy lie down and then you get
yourself in position so that it's

670
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:02,920
yourself in position so that it's
 

671
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,010
yourself in position so that it's
already there and then you just push

672
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,020
already there and then you just push
 

673
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:17,100
already there and then you just push
push push okay beside the training

674
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,110
push push okay beside the training
 

675
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,550
push push okay beside the training
aspect and I really think you should

676
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:19,560
aspect and I really think you should
 

677
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,210
aspect and I really think you should
let's just look at this kind of stuff

678
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,220
let's just look at this kind of stuff
 

679
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,010
let's just look at this kind of stuff
okay

680
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,020
okay
 

681
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,280
okay
if I start taking hands away so let's

682
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,290
if I start taking hands away so let's
 

683
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,910
if I start taking hands away so let's
take this one and he'll extend his arm

684
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:32,920
take this one and he'll extend his arm
 

685
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,360
take this one and he'll extend his arm
and now I'm not going to get it let's

686
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,370
and now I'm not going to get it let's
 

687
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,940
and now I'm not going to get it let's
take this one away I'm not going to get

688
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:38,950
take this one away I'm not going to get
 

689
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,350
take this one away I'm not going to get
it

690
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
it
 

691
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,100
it
this becomes limbed attended easy if I

692
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,110
this becomes limbed attended easy if I
 

693
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,100
this becomes limbed attended easy if I
have the other one and I'm here like

694
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,110
have the other one and I'm here like
 

695
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:54,690
have the other one and I'm here like
this so that's consistent with my

696
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:54,700
this so that's consistent with my
 

697
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,300
this so that's consistent with my
tactical architecture it's built upon

698
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,310
tactical architecture it's built upon
 

699
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,330
tactical architecture it's built upon
redundant systems so I could take many

700
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:00,340
redundant systems so I could take many
 

701
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,180
redundant systems so I could take many
of them away and still get it on the

702
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,190
of them away and still get it on the
 

703
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,180
of them away and still get it on the
other one I couldn't so I put the arm

704
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,190
other one I couldn't so I put the arm
 

705
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,730
other one I couldn't so I put the arm
where where it's going to be and you can

706
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:08,740
where where it's going to be and you can
 

707
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740
where where it's going to be and you can
see that you can take the art you can

708
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:10,750
see that you can take the art you can
 

709
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,840
see that you can take the art you can
take the arms to it it's still going to

710
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:12,850
take the arms to it it's still going to
 

711
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,180
take the arms to it it's still going to
do its thing you can take all the arms

712
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,190
do its thing you can take all the arms
 

713
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,830
do its thing you can take all the arms
away

714
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:16,840
away
 

715
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,169
away
okay why would that be important because

716
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:20,179
okay why would that be important because
 

717
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,740
okay why would that be important because
people fight do you understand that's

718
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:23,750
people fight do you understand that's
 

719
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,049
people fight do you understand that's
why you have redundant systems things

720
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:26,059
why you have redundant systems things
 

721
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,930
why you have redundant systems things
fail so you need something in case of

722
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:28,940
fail so you need something in case of
 

723
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,140
fail so you need something in case of
sale okay
