1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,990

okay so

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
okay so
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,870
okay so
uh yesterday's problems with the punches

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
uh yesterday's problems with the punches
 

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,349
uh yesterday's problems with the punches
obviously had a lot to do that uh there

6
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
obviously had a lot to do that uh there
 

7
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,990
obviously had a lot to do that uh there
is no direct correlation between key on

8
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
is no direct correlation between key on
 

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,629
is no direct correlation between key on
and application okay because your main

10
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
and application okay because your main
 

11
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,390
and application okay because your main
problem is your mind

12
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
problem is your mind
 

13
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,350
problem is your mind
but

14
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
but
 

15
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,230
but
how sound your architecture is

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
how sound your architecture is
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,310
how sound your architecture is
about the ceiling of what you can do

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
about the ceiling of what you can do
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,109
about the ceiling of what you can do
with

20
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
with
 

21
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,429
with
your mind if you did solve that problem

22
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
your mind if you did solve that problem
 

23
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,950
your mind if you did solve that problem
okay so

24
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
okay so
 

25
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,509
okay so
when you start from just keyhole pure

26
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
when you start from just keyhole pure
 

27
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,550
when you start from just keyhole pure
keyhole

28
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
keyhole
 

29
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,790
keyhole
you have to keep in mind the problems

30
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
you have to keep in mind the problems
 

31
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,030
you have to keep in mind the problems
you were having yesterday against the

32
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
you were having yesterday against the
 

33
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,310
you were having yesterday against the
punches okay so for example i'm going to

34
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
punches okay so for example i'm going to
 

35
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,510
punches okay so for example i'm going to
be cognizant of that power line on the

36
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
be cognizant of that power line on the
 

37
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,350
be cognizant of that power line on the
shoulders

38
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
shoulders
 

39
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,270
shoulders
so we review the

40
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
so we review the
 

41
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,229
so we review the
the keyhole for the mount reversal

42
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
the keyhole for the mount reversal
 

43
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,750
the keyhole for the mount reversal
uh don't

44
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
uh don't
 

45
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,069
uh don't
don't open your chin like this you're

46
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
don't open your chin like this you're
 

47
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,150
don't open your chin like this you're
always talk and you always have your

48
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
always talk and you always have your
 

49
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,189
always talk and you always have your
hands in a guard position okay

50
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
hands in a guard position okay
 

51
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,150
hands in a guard position okay
uh so as i come around this is going to

52
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
uh so as i come around this is going to
 

53
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,950
uh so as i come around this is going to
open me up dc and open my target up and

54
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
open me up dc and open my target up and
 

55
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,869
open me up dc and open my target up and
that's where that guy yesterday punched

56
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
that's where that guy yesterday punched
 

57
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,910
that's where that guy yesterday punched
you and you stopped that move do you see

58
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
you and you stopped that move do you see
 

59
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,630
you and you stopped that move do you see
so

60
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
so
 

61
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,750
so
i'm more thinking about what is going on

62
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
i'm more thinking about what is going on
 

63
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,950
i'm more thinking about what is going on
so even even here i'll go and i'll make

64
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
so even even here i'll go and i'll make
 

65
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,590
so even even here i'll go and i'll make
contact because he goes to punch i can

66
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
contact because he goes to punch i can
 

67
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,469
contact because he goes to punch i can
stick to him as opposed to i'm now doing

68
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
stick to him as opposed to i'm now doing
 

69
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,950
stick to him as opposed to i'm now doing
this move out mom you're gonna get hit

70
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
this move out mom you're gonna get hit
 

71
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,429
this move out mom you're gonna get hit
so i'm covering up i'm sticking to what

72
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
so i'm covering up i'm sticking to what
 

73
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,670
so i'm covering up i'm sticking to what
i need to stick to and i'm paying

74
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
i need to stick to and i'm paying
 

75
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,550
i need to stick to and i'm paying
attention to those power lines so as i

76
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
attention to those power lines so as i
 

77
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,429
attention to those power lines so as i
come around and get this going

78
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
come around and get this going
 

79
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,310
come around and get this going
uh

80
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
uh
 

81
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,870
uh
i don't want to be here

82
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
i don't want to be here
 

83
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,310
i don't want to be here
i'm going to

84
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
i'm going to
 

85
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,469
i'm going to
be hiding in here

86
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
be hiding in here
 

87
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,830
be hiding in here
coming around

88
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
coming around
 

89
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,350
coming around
hide in here

90
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
hide in here
 

91
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,230
hide in here
and then just bad technique this is not

92
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
and then just bad technique this is not
 

93
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,069
and then just bad technique this is not
it this is where the guy pulled his arm

94
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
it this is where the guy pulled his arm
 

95
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,550
it this is where the guy pulled his arm
out and punched you again with that hand

96
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
out and punched you again with that hand
 

97
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,270
out and punched you again with that hand
so as you come around you want to make

98
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
so as you come around you want to make
 

99
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,749
so as you come around you want to make
sure you have a thumbless cap on the

100
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
sure you have a thumbless cap on the
 

101
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,630
sure you have a thumbless cap on the
back so he can't pull his arm out and

102
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
back so he can't pull his arm out and
 

103
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,990
back so he can't pull his arm out and
his thumb was capped here so he can't

104
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
his thumb was capped here so he can't
 

105
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,789
his thumb was capped here so he can't
pull his arm out too laterally later so

106
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
pull his arm out too laterally later so
 

107
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,749
pull his arm out too laterally later so
i'm here like this stuck in place

108
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
i'm here like this stuck in place
 

109
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,109
i'm here like this stuck in place
next thing

110
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
next thing
 

111
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,150
next thing
uh

112
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
uh
 

113
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,030
uh
he's gonna move so you can reinforce

114
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
he's gonna move so you can reinforce
 

115
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,869
he's gonna move so you can reinforce
this basic first

116
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
this basic first
 

117
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,350
this basic first
by trapping it before you bridge do you

118
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
by trapping it before you bridge do you
 

119
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,390
by trapping it before you bridge do you
see that so i don't want to go here he

120
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
see that so i don't want to go here he
 

121
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,910
see that so i don't want to go here he
just pulls it out and oh okay so

122
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
just pulls it out and oh okay so
 

123
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,270
just pulls it out and oh okay so
here trap and then go to

124
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
here trap and then go to
 

125
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,030
here trap and then go to
the bridge and then always goes on him

126
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
the bridge and then always goes on him
 

127
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,910
the bridge and then always goes on him
bring your center notch here bring your

128
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
bring your center notch here bring your
 

129
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,270
bring your center notch here bring your
center with you before you see

130
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
center with you before you see
 

131
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,110
center with you before you see
the administrative ending of that

132
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
the administrative ending of that
 

133
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,750
the administrative ending of that
posture

134
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760

 

135
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,070

then the other point is you can start

136
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
then the other point is you can start
 

137
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,509
then the other point is you can start
this form

138
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
this form
 

139
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,390
this form
a right as he's getting on so you have

140
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
a right as he's getting on so you have
 

141
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,390
a right as he's getting on so you have
some sense

142
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
some sense
 

143
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,229
some sense
of musubi

144
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
of musubi
 

145
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:04,250
of musubi
with his techniques

146
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,260

 

147
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,190

[Music]

148
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200

 

149
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,750

okay let's try and get those details in

150
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
okay let's try and get those details in
 

151
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,509
okay let's try and get those details in
because they were punishing you

152
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
because they were punishing you
 

153
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,030
because they were punishing you
yesterday

154
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
yesterday
 

155
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,270
yesterday
so the beginning of your movement is all

156
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,280
so the beginning of your movement is all
 

157
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,270
so the beginning of your movement is all
administrative okay that's why

158
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
administrative okay that's why
 

159
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,750
administrative okay that's why
he's just like this okay you saw

160
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
he's just like this okay you saw
 

161
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,789
he's just like this okay you saw
yesterday that the he has to provide the

162
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
yesterday that the he has to provide the
 

163
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,190
yesterday that the he has to provide the
opening for the movement okay

164
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
opening for the movement okay
 

165
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,110
opening for the movement okay
uh so for example

166
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
uh so for example
 

167
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,470
uh so for example
uh the way his body is now i would not

168
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
uh the way his body is now i would not
 

169
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,589
uh the way his body is now i would not
do that

170
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
do that
 

171
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,110
do that
this makes my leg vulnerable or he can

172
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
this makes my leg vulnerable or he can
 

173
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,869
this makes my leg vulnerable or he can
just grab my ankle

174
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
just grab my ankle
 

175
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,710
just grab my ankle
and pull it slowly

176
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
and pull it slowly
 

177
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,030
and pull it slowly
and he's gonna tweak go ahead you can do

178
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
and he's gonna tweak go ahead you can do
 

179
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,190
and he's gonna tweak go ahead you can do
it he's gonna tweak my lips my knee do

180
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
it he's gonna tweak my lips my knee do
 

181
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,309
it he's gonna tweak my lips my knee do
you see

182
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
you see
 

183
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,470
you see
uh so

184
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
uh so
 

185
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,110
uh so
but if you remember some of you were

186
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
but if you remember some of you were
 

187
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,350
but if you remember some of you were
grabbing really tight well see he walked

188
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
grabbing really tight well see he walked
 

189
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,630
grabbing really tight well see he walked
into it and just that little movement

190
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
into it and just that little movement
 

191
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,789
into it and just that little movement
already tightens it and takes the

192
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
already tightens it and takes the
 

193
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,390
already tightens it and takes the
balance dc

194
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
balance dc
 

195
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,990
balance dc
uh but when you learn the move

196
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
uh but when you learn the move
 

197
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,630
uh but when you learn the move
administratively this you that's part of

198
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
administratively this you that's part of
 

199
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,789
administratively this you that's part of
the move but you'll never get that in my

200
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
the move but you'll never get that in my
 

201
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,630
the move but you'll never get that in my
experience unless you violate jiu jitsu

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
right there and i got him do you see
 

213
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,749
right there and i got him do you see
okay that is more obvious when you're

214
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
okay that is more obvious when you're
 

215
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,990

so uh

220
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720

when someone's punching you
 

249
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,469
when someone's punching you
he goes your hands just left you open do

250
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
he goes your hands just left you open do
 

251
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,670
he goes your hands just left you open do
you see so this is not how you will find

252
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
you see so this is not how you will find
 

253
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,430
you see so this is not how you will find
it in the technique

254
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
it in the technique
 

255
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,870
it in the technique
but

256
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
but
 

257
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,790
but
the movement is

258
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
the movement is
 

259
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,230
the movement is
that

260
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
that
 

261
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,830
that
his knees one knee or so will be light

262
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
his knees one knee or so will be light
 

263
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,070
his knees one knee or so will be light
and his energy will be going in the

264
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
and his energy will be going in the
 

265
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,909
and his energy will be going in the
opposite direction

266
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
opposite direction
 

267
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,469
opposite direction
that you're going okay

268
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
that you're going okay
 

269
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,830
that you're going okay
so that's what you see here so i go one

270
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
so that's what you see here so i go one
 

271
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,310
so that's what you see here so i go one
i've made his knees light do you see and

272
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
i've made his knees light do you see and
 

273
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,029
i've made his knees light do you see and
then i'm going to push in this way and

274
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
then i'm going to push in this way and
 

275
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,749
then i'm going to push in this way and
i'll shrimp out the other way

276
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
i'll shrimp out the other way
 

277
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,590
i'll shrimp out the other way
okay

278
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
okay
 

279
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,870
okay
so for example where that comes into

280
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
so for example where that comes into
 

281
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,430
so for example where that comes into
play he goes to strike i take his

282
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
play he goes to strike i take his
 

283
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,550
play he goes to strike i take his
balance and you'll see this knee is like

284
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
balance and you'll see this knee is like
 

285
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,430
balance and you'll see this knee is like
you see so here's where i can come out

286
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
you see so here's where i can come out
 

287
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,870
you see so here's where i can come out
on that side

288
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
on that side
 

289
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,310
on that side
so as you're doing it administratively

290
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
so as you're doing it administratively
 

291
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,670
so as you're doing it administratively
make sure

292
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
make sure
 

293
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,830
make sure
that you get a knee

294
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
that you get a knee
 

295
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,590
that you get a knee
like

296
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600

 

297
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,670

and that you're the one going around

298
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
and that you're the one going around
 

299
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,870
and that you're the one going around
things

300
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
things
 

301
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,830
things
as opposed

302
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
as opposed
 

303
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,670
as opposed
to moving him

304
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
to moving him
 

305
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,909
to moving him
so you're not going

306
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919

 

307
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,070

that is not going to be

308
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
that is not going to be
 

309
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,350
that is not going to be
relatable to dynamic situation so i'm

310
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
relatable to dynamic situation so i'm
 

311
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,189
relatable to dynamic situation so i'm
moving myself

312
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
moving myself
 

313
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,990
moving myself
moving myself

314
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
moving myself
 

315
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,550
moving myself
okay let's try it

316
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
okay let's try it
 

317
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,950
okay let's try it
go

318
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960

 

319
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,950

you're gonna be in his life

320
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
you're gonna be in his life
 

321
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,710
you're gonna be in his life
you go around his knees

322
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
you go around his knees
 

323
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,070
you go around his knees
so in the administrative starting

324
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
so in the administrative starting
 

325
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,350
so in the administrative starting
position of each move

326
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
position of each move
 

327
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,710
position of each move
um

328
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
um
 

329
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,629
um
for example

330
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
for example
 

331
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,150
for example
as i said if he has his legs out there i

332
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
as i said if he has his legs out there i
 

333
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,790
as i said if he has his legs out there i
would not try to get that

334
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
would not try to get that
 

335
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,550
would not try to get that
so that is not the administrative

336
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
so that is not the administrative
 

337
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,830
so that is not the administrative
starting position for the mount reversal

338
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
starting position for the mount reversal
 

339
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,589
starting position for the mount reversal
if he is squeezing the hell out of me

340
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
if he is squeezing the hell out of me
 

341
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,070
if he is squeezing the hell out of me
that is not the administrative position

342
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
that is not the administrative position
 

343
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,510
that is not the administrative position
for the elbow knee so he does not do

344
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
for the elbow knee so he does not do
 

345
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,870
for the elbow knee so he does not do
that

346
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
that
 

347
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,550
that
got it

348
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
got it
 

349
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,950
got it
that said however

350
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
that said however
 

351
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,070
that said however
there are some common

352
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
there are some common
 

353
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,350
there are some common
mistakes

354
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
mistakes
 

355
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,510
mistakes
that you leave out because

356
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
that you leave out because
 

357
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,469
that you leave out because
you're confusing for example

358
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
you're confusing for example
 

359
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,189
you're confusing for example
the shrimping drill that you would do at

360
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
the shrimping drill that you would do at
 

361
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,589
the shrimping drill that you would do at
the beginning

362
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
the beginning
 

363
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,230
the beginning
with the technique

364
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240

 

365
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,550

the technique obeys the rules of yin

366
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
the technique obeys the rules of yin
 

367
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,950
the technique obeys the rules of yin
space so you can only shrimp into yin

368
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
space so you can only shrimp into yin
 

369
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,070
space so you can only shrimp into yin
space if your normal shrimping pattern

370
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
space if your normal shrimping pattern
 

371
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,790
space if your normal shrimping pattern
takes you into yang space you're doing

372
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
takes you into yang space you're doing
 

373
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,990
takes you into yang space you're doing
it wrong

374
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
it wrong
 

375
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,670
it wrong
so in this maneuver i don't shrimp into

376
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
so in this maneuver i don't shrimp into
 

377
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,510
so in this maneuver i don't shrimp into
his other leg

378
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
his other leg
 

379
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,110
his other leg
you see that's not where it goes

380
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
you see that's not where it goes
 

381
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,830
you see that's not where it goes
so

382
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
so
 

383
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,830
so
you're going to shrimp

384
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
you're going to shrimp
 

385
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,589
you're going to shrimp
forward

386
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
forward
 

387
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,510
forward
until you feel the in space around the

388
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
until you feel the in space around the
 

389
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,749
until you feel the in space around the
leg you're shrimping around okay so you

390
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
leg you're shrimping around okay so you
 

391
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,909
leg you're shrimping around okay so you
don't shrimp into the other leg so whoa

392
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
don't shrimp into the other leg so whoa
 

393
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,430
don't shrimp into the other leg so whoa
forward there's the in space that's when

394
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
forward there's the in space that's when
 

395
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,270
forward there's the in space that's when
i come out

396
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
i come out
 

397
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,469
i come out
bring the leg

398
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
bring the leg
 

399
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,430
bring the leg
up

400
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
up
 

401
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,869
up
second mistake that tends to happen is

402
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
second mistake that tends to happen is
 

403
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,309
second mistake that tends to happen is
you can

404
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
you can
 

405
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,029
you can
especially on a guy who's static you can

406
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
especially on a guy who's static you can
 

407
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,110
especially on a guy who's static you can
kind of do all of this

408
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
kind of do all of this
 

409
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,510
kind of do all of this
with just your abdominals

410
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
with just your abdominals
 

411
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,150
with just your abdominals
and your knee hooks

412
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
and your knee hooks
 

413
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,110
and your knee hooks
on his hip bones but you will find that

414
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
on his hip bones but you will find that
 

415
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,310
on his hip bones but you will find that
very difficult to do

416
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
very difficult to do
 

417
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,430

get those two concepts going only shrimp
into the in space

484
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
into the in space
 

485
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,630
into the in space
leave that last pivot foot in the middle

486
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
leave that last pivot foot in the middle
 

487
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,990
leave that last pivot foot in the middle
of their legs

488
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
of their legs
 

489
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,310

so again in like a competition setting
 

497
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,269
so again in like a competition setting
it it would be fine to

498

them here but not in a more live setting
 

503
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,150
them here but not in a more live setting
like yesterday okay so

504

um
 

507
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,910
um
as i do this maneuver

508
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
as i do this maneuver
 

509
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,990
as i do this maneuver
i'm going to start

510
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
i'm going to start
 

511
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,470
i'm going to start
modifying it closer to what i would have

512
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
modifying it closer to what i would have
 

513
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,230
modifying it closer to what i would have
to do if he's striking me okay so i have

514
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
to do if he's striking me okay so i have
 

515
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,310
to do if he's striking me okay so i have
the same rules i'm going to use that

516
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320

they build on each other
as you can see for example

688
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
as you can see for example
 

689
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,629
as you can see for example
in this last technique we just did

690
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
in this last technique we just did
 

691
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,350
in this last technique we just did
uh the second half is the second

692
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
uh the second half is the second
 

693
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,790
uh the second half is the second
technique we did okay and the first half

694
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
technique we did okay and the first half
 

695
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,670
technique we did okay and the first half
the very first half the bridge was the

696
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
the very first half the bridge was the
 

697
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,550
the very first half the bridge was the
part of the first technique okay and so

698
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
part of the first technique okay and so
 

699
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,590
part of the first technique okay and so
likewise the force technique is going to

700
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
likewise the force technique is going to
 

701
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,750
likewise the force technique is going to
use the bridge in a way very similar to

702
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
use the bridge in a way very similar to
 

703
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,710
use the bridge in a way very similar to
the last technique okay so we can start

704
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
the last technique okay so we can start
 

705
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,110
the last technique okay so we can start
from the administrative position

706
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
from the administrative position
 

707
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,230
from the administrative position
uh

708
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
uh
 

709
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,750
uh
and i'm going to bridge him onto my

710
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
and i'm going to bridge him onto my
 

711
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,069
and i'm going to bridge him onto my
hands

712
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
hands
 

713
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,189
hands
and then

714
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
and then
 

715
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,189
and then
this leg is light

716
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
this leg is light
 

717
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,910
this leg is light
and i use transfer his weight to my

718
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
and i use transfer his weight to my
 

719
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,030
and i use transfer his weight to my
hands as i shrimp out that light

720
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
hands as i shrimp out that light
 

721
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,990
hands as i shrimp out that light
laying there and then we just stopped in

722
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
laying there and then we just stopped in
 

723
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,670
laying there and then we just stopped in
this position of course you have your

724
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
this position of course you have your
 

725
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,230
this position of course you have your
heel hooks and your reversals and things

726
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
heel hooks and your reversals and things
 

727
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,829
heel hooks and your reversals and things
like we just stopped here to work the

728
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
like we just stopped here to work the
 

729
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,389
like we just stopped here to work the
dilemma aspects okay

730
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
dilemma aspects okay
 

731
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,590
dilemma aspects okay
so

732
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
so
 

733
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,030
so
same thing

you're out
you should not feel his weight

744
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
you should not feel his weight
 

745
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,790
you should not feel his weight
at all it's a transfer

746
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
at all it's a transfer
 

747
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,350
at all it's a transfer
of his body

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
into that position okay
 

751
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,990
into that position okay
um and then

752
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
um and then
 

753
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,030
um and then
same thing

754
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040

 

755
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,310

yesterday some of you tried this move

756
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
yesterday some of you tried this move
 

757
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,150
yesterday some of you tried this move
when the guy's weight was either

758
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
when the guy's weight was either
 

759
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,629
when the guy's weight was either
supporting his balance or he was

760
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
supporting his balance or he was
 

761
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,069
supporting his balance or he was
pressuring you

762
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
pressuring you
 

763
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,949
pressuring you
that's not when you would do this move

764
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
that's not when you would do this move
 

765
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,590
that's not when you would do this move
uh it's more when he goes up to punch

766
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
uh it's more when he goes up to punch
 

767
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,710
uh it's more when he goes up to punch

768
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
you that's when you do that move so he
 

769
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,269
you that's when you do that move so he
goes up to punch you and that's when

goes up to punch you and that's when
 

771
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,389
goes up to punch you and that's when
that move comes out you see that so

772
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
that move comes out you see that so
 

773
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,150
that move comes out you see that so
uh emphasizing even more the point

774
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
uh emphasizing even more the point
 

775
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,470
uh emphasizing even more the point
that you're not muscling him

776
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
that you're not muscling him
 

777
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,030
that you're not muscling him
so don't muscle him now

778

so don't muscle him now
 

779
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,110
so don't muscle him now
figure out

780
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
figure out
 

781
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,030
figure out
how to get

782
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
how to get
 

783
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,389
how to get
that to be effortless by moving into the

784
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
that to be effortless by moving into the
 

785
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,829
that to be effortless by moving into the
in space

786
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
in space
 

787
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,990
in space
and using

788
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
and using
 

789
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,389
and using
his energy his mass

790
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
his energy his mass
 

791
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,949
his energy his mass
in a way where you're not actually

792
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
in a way where you're not actually
 

793
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,470
in a way where you're not actually
lifting it and pushing it okay

794
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
lifting it and pushing it okay
 

795
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,350
lifting it and pushing it okay
trying

796
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
trying
 

797
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,550
trying
okay so

798
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
okay so
 

799
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,509
okay so
uh

800
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
uh
 

801
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,629
uh
again a beginner mistake is

802
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
again a beginner mistake is
 

803
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,430
again a beginner mistake is
not really in a sophisticated way

804
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
not really in a sophisticated way
 

805
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,829
not really in a sophisticated way
understanding yin and yang

806
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
understanding yin and yang
 

807
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,509
understanding yin and yang
yin and yang

808
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
yin and yang
 

809
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,829
yin and yang
yin is not always empty space okay

810
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
yin is not always empty space okay
 

811
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,949
yin is not always empty space okay
yen is always relative to yang

812
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
yen is always relative to yang
 

813
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,509
yen is always relative to yang
so in the second move

814
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
so in the second move
 

815
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,870
so in the second move
i went into empty space in the fourth

816
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
i went into empty space in the fourth
 

817
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,310
i went into empty space in the fourth
move i go into yid space okay so what do

818
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
move i go into yid space okay so what do
 

819
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,550
move i go into yid space okay so what do
i mean by that as i go to do the

820
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
i mean by that as i go to do the
 

821
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,749
i mean by that as i go to do the
maneuver

822
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
maneuver
 

823
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,670
maneuver
i don't want to try to go around his leg

824
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
i don't want to try to go around his leg
 

825
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,310
i don't want to try to go around his leg
like the first move

826
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
like the first move
 

827
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,949
like the first move
as i go to do the maneuver

828
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
as i go to do the maneuver
 

829
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,590
as i go to do the maneuver
boom i move into

830
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
boom i move into
 

831
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,789
boom i move into
this leg i'm moving into that leg the

832
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
this leg i'm moving into that leg the
 

833
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,549
this leg i'm moving into that leg the
leg is relative yin to my movement

834
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
leg is relative yin to my movement
 

835
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,870
leg is relative yin to my movement
because all his weight is here so

836
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
because all his weight is here so
 

837
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,590
because all his weight is here so
wherever i feel that leg

838
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
wherever i feel that leg
 

839
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,549
wherever i feel that leg
cool that's what i pushed into that leg

840
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
cool that's what i pushed into that leg
 

841
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,110
cool that's what i pushed into that leg
to get out of that position okay

842
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120

 

843
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,669

watch that you're not feeling

844
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
watch that you're not feeling
 

845
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,990
watch that you're not feeling
for the empty space

846
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
for the empty space
 

847
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,669
for the empty space
and you're trying to go like this as

848
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
and you're trying to go like this as
 

849
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,430
and you're trying to go like this as
you're never going you didn't get the

850
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
you're never going you didn't get the
 

851
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,669
you're never going you didn't get the
leg okay

852
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
leg okay
 

853
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,110
leg okay
feel where his leg is boom

854
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
feel where his leg is boom
 

855
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,909
feel where his leg is boom
move right into that leg position and

856
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
move right into that leg position and
 

857
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,440
move right into that leg position and
then you'll have your stuff okay
