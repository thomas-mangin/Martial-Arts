can use that guard
and to create my angle deviation he goes

282
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
and to create my angle deviation he goes
 

283
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,830
and to create my angle deviation he goes
again

284
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
again
 

285
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,710

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,790
redundant
like that

294
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800

 

295
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,469

okay next drill i'm going to do a

296
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
okay next drill i'm going to do a
 

297
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,430
okay next drill i'm going to do a
combination

298
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
combination
 

299
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,550
combination
of that last drill and then he goes

300
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
of that last drill and then he goes
 

301
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,309
of that last drill and then he goes
so that's the last one he goes and i'm

302

so that's the last one he goes and i'm
 

303
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,029
so that's the last one he goes and i'm
going to combine it with the first row

304
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
going to combine it with the first row
 

305
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,510
going to combine it with the first row
so

306
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
so
 

307
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,629
so
he goes boom he goes i

308
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639

follow him into that so
i'm not going to sit here deviate

312
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
i'm not going to sit here deviate
 

313
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,270
i'm not going to sit here deviate
deviate and then try to get that

314
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
deviate and then try to get that
 

315
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,029
deviate and then try to get that
i'm going to deviate follow him into it

316
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
i'm going to deviate follow him into it
 

317
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,950
i'm going to deviate follow him into it
and then get it then he's going to test

318
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
and then get it then he's going to test
 

319
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,830
and then get it then he's going to test
