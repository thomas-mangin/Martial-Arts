them better so one of the problems you
 

131
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,630
them better so one of the problems you

jitsu
forced me to kind of make a set of

214
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
forced me to kind of make a set of
 

215
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,830
forced me to kind of make a set of
clinches that were our additional grabs

216
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
clinches that were our additional grabs
 

217
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,270
clinches that were our additional grabs
that we had and i'll put a picture of

218
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
that we had and i'll put a picture of
 

219
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,869
that we had and i'll put a picture of
them on here so you can see them but i

220
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
them on here so you can see them but i
 

221
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,110
them on here so you can see them but i
created a set of additional clinches

222
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
created a set of additional clinches
 

223
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,630
created a set of additional clinches
that you need and those clinches are

224
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
that you need and those clinches are
 

225
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,550
that you need and those clinches are
just how you would hold the hand while

226
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
just how you would hold the hand while
 

227
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,630
just how you would hold the hand while
moving around the body so when something

228
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
moving around the body so when something
 

229
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,789
moving around the body so when something
like a shiro kubashima when you look at

230
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
like a shiro kubashima when you look at
 

231
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,390
like a shiro kubashima when you look at
this kind of graph oh this suddenly

232
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
this kind of graph oh this suddenly
 

233
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,670
this kind of graph oh this suddenly
starts to make sense as to why you're

234
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
starts to make sense as to why you're
 

235
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,030
starts to make sense as to why you're
holding their hand while you're choking

236
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
holding their hand while you're choking
 

237
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,949
holding their hand while you're choking
them because i have to check this weapon

238
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
them because i have to check this weapon
 

239
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,470
them because i have to check this weapon
now there's a set of those that go all

240
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
now there's a set of those that go all
 

241
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,149
now there's a set of those that go all
the way around the body and i outline

242
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
the way around the body and i outline
 

243
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,830
the way around the body and i outline
them and when i was looking at aikido's

244
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
them and when i was looking at aikido's
 

245
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,270
them and when i was looking at aikido's
jitsu system that was one of the real

246
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
jitsu system that was one of the real
 

247
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,710
jitsu system that was one of the real
confusing things to me because i was

248
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
confusing things to me because i was
 

249
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,509
confusing things to me because i was
like it it has to have these kinds of

250
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
like it it has to have these kinds of
 

251
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,429
like it it has to have these kinds of
holds and the fact that no aikido style

252
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
holds and the fact that no aikido style
 

253
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,509
holds and the fact that no aikido style
talks about holds that look like this or

254
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
talks about holds that look like this or
 

255
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,830
talks about holds that look like this or
not any style that i discovered

256
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
not any style that i discovered
 

257
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,469
not any style that i discovered
then it's silly that these don't exist

258
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
then it's silly that these don't exist
 

259
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,230
then it's silly that these don't exist
but when you look at it as the guys with

260
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
but when you look at it as the guys with
 

261
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,790
but when you look at it as the guys with
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh

262
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh
 

263
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,550
the weapon the emphasis becomes on josh
being able to clear this as soon as

264
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
being able to clear this as soon as
 

265
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,629
being able to clear this as soon as
possible right so if it gets into a

266
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
possible right so if it gets into a
 

267
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,909
possible right so if it gets into a
deeper hold well that's beyond the

268
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
deeper hold well that's beyond the
 

269
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,430
deeper hold well that's beyond the
martial art of aikido but at this

270
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
martial art of aikido but at this
 

271
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,830
martial art of aikido but at this
beginning hold now he needs to find some

272
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
beginning hold now he needs to find some
 

273
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,270
beginning hold now he needs to find some
way to escape and then get his weapon

274
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
way to escape and then get his weapon
 

275
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,110
way to escape and then get his weapon
back in the game so it's very important

276
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
back in the game so it's very important
 

277
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
back in the game so it's very important
for him that he master how to deal with

278
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
for him that he master how to deal with
 

279
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,950
for him that he master how to deal with
