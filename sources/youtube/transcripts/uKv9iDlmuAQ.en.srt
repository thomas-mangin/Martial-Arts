um we want you to understand what what
 

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,070
um we want you to understand what what
we mean by internal aspects

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
we mean by internal aspects
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,430
we mean by internal aspects
internal aspects are what i do with his

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,430
internal aspects are what i do with his
energy

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440

 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,910

not necessarily what i do with my energy

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
not necessarily what i do with my energy

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,029
not necessarily what i do with my energy
although his energy

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
although his energy
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,710
although his energy
does become my energy

14
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720

 

15
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,910

and not what i do externally nor
 

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,150
and not what i do externally nor
do i mean anything

so i don't mean anything or anything

24
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239

okay so i want to draw some

42
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
okay so i want to draw some
 

43
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,670
okay so i want to draw some
distinctions between some common

44
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680

00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
mistakes
 

47
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,549
mistakes
that people and you might have regarding

48
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
that people and you might have regarding
 

49
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,030
that people and you might have regarding
what

50
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
what
 

51
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,550
what
are the internal aspects of the art okay

52
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560

 

53
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,750

so a common one is

54
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
so a common one is
 

55
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,390
so a common one is
that my biomechanical efficiency

56
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
that my biomechanical efficiency
 

57
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,670
that my biomechanical efficiency
is understood as the internal aspects

58
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
is understood as the internal aspects
 

59
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,590
is understood as the internal aspects
because there's a there's an underlying

60
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
because there's a there's an underlying
 

61
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,950
because there's a there's an underlying
i don't understand what internal aspects

62
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
i don't understand what internal aspects
 

63
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,510
i don't understand what internal aspects
mean

64
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
mean
 

65
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,069
mean
but they sound good and i should have

66
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
but they sound good and i should have
 

67
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,710
but they sound good and i should have
them

68
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
them
 

69
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,469
them
and they should make me better off

70
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
and they should make me better off
 

71
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,550
and they should make me better off
having them to not having them

72
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
having them to not having them
 

73
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,990
having them to not having them
and so if i could do something or i feel

74
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
and so if i could do something or i feel
 

75
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,270
and so if i could do something or i feel
powerful or where i appear powerful

76
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
powerful or where i appear powerful
 

77
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,710
powerful or where i appear powerful
that must be the internal aspects

78
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
that must be the internal aspects
 

79
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,149
that must be the internal aspects
no it's just external biomechanical

80
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
no it's just external biomechanical
 

81
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,270
no it's just external biomechanical
efficiency

82
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
efficiency
 

83
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,590
efficiency
and that is a part of your martial art

84
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
and that is a part of your martial art
 

85
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,270
and that is a part of your martial art
okay so

86
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
okay so
 

87
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,389
okay so
an example of this is um

88
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
an example of this is um
 

89
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,749
an example of this is um
because i'm a bipedal machine with

90
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
because i'm a bipedal machine with
 

91
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,109
because i'm a bipedal machine with
this kind of chain link axis running

92
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
this kind of chain link axis running
 

93
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,869
this kind of chain link axis running
part way down my body

94
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879

 

95
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,790

the way my structure is set up

96
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800

 

97
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,070

where i will feel a lesser percentage of

98
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
where i will feel a lesser percentage of
 

99
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,390
where i will feel a lesser percentage of
my

100
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
my
 

101
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,790
my

102
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
force output potential being utilized
 

103
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,190
force output potential being utilized
the larger muscle groups i use the more

104
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
the larger muscle groups i use the more
 

105
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,190
the larger muscle groups i use the more
of the rear posterior chain i use and

106
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
of the rear posterior chain i use and
 

107
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,750
of the rear posterior chain i use and
therefore

108
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
therefore
 

109
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,949
therefore
the closer that i am to the front center

110
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
the closer that i am to the front center
 

111
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,390
the closer that i am to the front center
line of my body

112
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
line of my body
 

113
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,630
line of my body
the more access i have to the rear

114
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
the more access i have to the rear
 

115
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,990
the more access i have to the rear
posterior chain

116
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
posterior chain
 

117
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,150
posterior chain
those larger muscle groups the smaller

118
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
those larger muscle groups the smaller
 

119
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,350
those larger muscle groups the smaller
percentage i'm using

120
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
percentage i'm using
 

121
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,750
percentage i'm using
of my force potential you will be

122
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
of my force potential you will be
 

123
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,750
of my force potential you will be
mechanically more efficient

124
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
mechanically more efficient
 

125
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830
mechanically more efficient
than if you didn't do that but that is

126
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
than if you didn't do that but that is
 

127
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,350
than if you didn't do that but that is
not internal

128
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
not internal
 

129
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,110
not internal
the internal aspects of which we're

130
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
the internal aspects of which we're
 

131
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,350
the internal aspects of which we're
speaking up where i use his energy

132
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
speaking up where i use his energy
 

133
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,550
speaking up where i use his energy
so an example of this is um

134
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
so an example of this is um
 

135
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,869
so an example of this is um
if i if i don't let me pick my hand up

136
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
if i if i don't let me pick my hand up
 

137
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,910
if i if i don't let me pick my hand up
don't want to do that

138
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
don't want to do that
 

139
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,869
don't want to do that
so if i try to pick my hand up let's say

140
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
so if i try to pick my hand up let's say
 

141
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,990
so if i try to pick my hand up let's say
i'll put my elbow

142
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
i'll put my elbow
 

143
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,110
i'll put my elbow
further away from my body and i try to

144
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
further away from my body and i try to
 

145
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,990
further away from my body and i try to
pick my hand

146
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
pick my hand
 

147
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,030
pick my hand
up what happens is that my bicep gets

148
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
up what happens is that my bicep gets
 

149
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,990
up what happens is that my bicep gets
isolated

150
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
isolated
 

151
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,630
isolated
and this movement becomes dependent on

152
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
and this movement becomes dependent on
 

153
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,949
and this movement becomes dependent on
the strength of my bicep

154
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
the strength of my bicep
 

155
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,470
the strength of my bicep
but if i move my elbow closer to my

156
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
but if i move my elbow closer to my
 

157
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,509
but if i move my elbow closer to my
spine and in the center of my spine

158
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
spine and in the center of my spine
 

159
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,710
spine and in the center of my spine
and this move becomes very easy you see

160
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
and this move becomes very easy you see
 

161
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,229
and this move becomes very easy you see
see how i did that so we're going to

162
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
see how i did that so we're going to
 

163
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,949
see how i did that so we're going to
step out elbow is on the side here's my

164
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
step out elbow is on the side here's my
 

165
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,589
step out elbow is on the side here's my
spine line elbows on the side so on the

166
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
spine line elbows on the side so on the
 

167
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,070
spine line elbows on the side so on the
on the young shoulder line and my elbows

168
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
on the young shoulder line and my elbows
 

169
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,990
on the young shoulder line and my elbows
away from my body and you'll try to pick

170
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
away from my body and you'll try to pick
 

171
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,869
away from my body and you'll try to pick
that up

172
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
that up
 

173
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,509
that up
then move the elbow to at least the yin

174
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
then move the elbow to at least the yin
 

175
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:41,910
then move the elbow to at least the yin
line

176
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
line
 

177
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,030
line
if not to the transitional line and move

178
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
if not to the transitional line and move
 

179
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,470
if not to the transitional line and move
your elbow close your body

180
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
your elbow close your body
 

181
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,710
your elbow close your body
and then pick up the arm and you'll see

182
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
and then pick up the arm and you'll see
 

183
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,589
and then pick up the arm and you'll see
uh i

184
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
uh i
 

185
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,149
uh i
am using less of my force output

186
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
am using less of my force output
 

187
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,030
am using less of my force output
potential

188
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
potential
 

189
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,589
potential
okay so this is just an external

190
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
okay so this is just an external
 

191
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,070
okay so this is just an external
biomechanical efficiency it is not the

192
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
biomechanical efficiency it is not the
 

193
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,509
biomechanical efficiency it is not the
internal aspect so

194
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
internal aspect so
 

195
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,630
internal aspect so
let's try that okay the next thing you

196
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
let's try that okay the next thing you
 

197
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,190
let's try that okay the next thing you
can do

198
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
can do
 

199
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,270
can do
externally is you can play with the

200
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
externally is you can play with the
 

201
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,350
externally is you can play with the
geometry of your two

202
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
geometry of your two
 

203
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,429
geometry of your two
external frames so in that last one i'm

204
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
external frames so in that last one i'm
 

205
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,350
external frames so in that last one i'm
just engaging more of the rear cluster

206
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
just engaging more of the rear cluster
 

207
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,309
just engaging more of the rear cluster
your chain

208
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
your chain
 

209
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,350
your chain
but you can couple that or not couple it

210
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
but you can couple that or not couple it
 

211
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,069
but you can couple that or not couple it
with

212
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
with
 

213
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,830
with
just a kind of uh i have a better

214
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
just a kind of uh i have a better
 

215
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,110
just a kind of uh i have a better
mechanical geometry than he does

216
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
mechanical geometry than he does
 

217
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,550
mechanical geometry than he does
so for example um the

218
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
so for example um the
 

219
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,909
so for example um the
distal end of the lever is

220
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
distal end of the lever is
 

221
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,230
distal end of the lever is
is easier for me to move than when i'm

222
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
is easier for me to move than when i'm
 

223
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,310
is easier for me to move than when i'm
when i'm over here by this elbow

224
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
when i'm over here by this elbow
 

225
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,150
when i'm over here by this elbow
that's why you use levers to move

226
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
that's why you use levers to move
 

227
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,670
that's why you use levers to move
objects okay so

228
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
objects okay so
 

229
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,790
objects okay so
that's kind of what happened when i

230
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
that's kind of what happened when i
 

231
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,150
that's kind of what happened when i
brought myself closer and maybe you made

232
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
brought myself closer and maybe you made
 

233
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,590
brought myself closer and maybe you made
the mistake of lifting

234
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
the mistake of lifting
 

235
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,230
the mistake of lifting
by doing going that way but if you stay

236
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
by doing going that way but if you stay
 

237
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,909
by doing going that way but if you stay
on this line where his

238
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
on this line where his
 

239
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,870
on this line where his
lever is the longest it gets even easier

240
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
lever is the longest it gets even easier
 

241
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,189
lever is the longest it gets even easier
so

242
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
so
 

243
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,510
so
really really try i'm just going to lift

244
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
really really try i'm just going to lift
 

245
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,390
really really try i'm just going to lift
that up

246
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
that up
 

247
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,749
that up
that part up well it's even easier

248
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
that part up well it's even easier
 

249
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,950
that part up well it's even easier
okay so try it now as i increase my

250
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
okay so try it now as i increase my
 

251
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,550
okay so try it now as i increase my
biomechanical efficiency

252
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
biomechanical efficiency
 

253
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,430
biomechanical efficiency
i can also decrease his by my

254
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
i can also decrease his by my
 

255
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,629
i can also decrease his by my
biomechanical

256
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
biomechanical
 

257
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,670
biomechanical
efficiency as we go along so in the last

258
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
efficiency as we go along so in the last
 

259
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,230
efficiency as we go along so in the last
example i was just using it as it was

260
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
example i was just using it as it was
 

261
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,629
example i was just using it as it was
but

262
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
but
 

263
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,150
but
i can combine that with a continuing

264
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
i can combine that with a continuing
 

265
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,790
i can combine that with a continuing
decreasing so rather than just lift this

266
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
decreasing so rather than just lift this
 

267
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,350
decreasing so rather than just lift this
here

268
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
here
 

269
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,830
here
what i'm going to do is employ multiple

270
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
what i'm going to do is employ multiple
 

271
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,909
what i'm going to do is employ multiple
levers that keep getting that to

272
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
levers that keep getting that to
 

273
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,790
levers that keep getting that to
weaken okay so instead of lifting just

274
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
weaken okay so instead of lifting just
 

275
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,670
weaken okay so instead of lifting just
here

276
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
here
 

277
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,990
here
against his energy i now start to go

278
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
against his energy i now start to go
 

279
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,110
against his energy i now start to go
around his energy

280
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
around his energy
 

281
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,870
around his energy
by just applying another lever at the

282
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
by just applying another lever at the
 

283
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,749
by just applying another lever at the
elbow and another other level lever at

284
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
elbow and another other level lever at
 

285
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,390
elbow and another other level lever at
the wrist

286
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
the wrist
 

287
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,230
the wrist
okay and i'm just here and it's just too

288
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
okay and i'm just here and it's just too
 

289
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,950
okay and i'm just here and it's just too
it's just too easy you can't hold it

290
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
it's just too easy you can't hold it
 

291
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,990
it's just too easy you can't hold it
down hold it down

292
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
down hold it down
 

293
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,590
down hold it down
cannot hold it okay try it

294
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
cannot hold it okay try it
 

295
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,230
cannot hold it okay try it
so right now i've done nothing to his

296
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
so right now i've done nothing to his
 

297
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,790
so right now i've done nothing to his

other than overpower it so this this is

300
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
other than overpower it so this this is
 

301
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,350
other than overpower it so this this is
not the internal aspect

302
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
not the internal aspect
 

303
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,909
not the internal aspect
but a lot of people go wow i feel so

304
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
but a lot of people go wow i feel so
 

305
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,270
but a lot of people go wow i feel so
powerful

306
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
powerful
 

307
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,350
powerful
this must be the thing i don't

308
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
this must be the thing i don't
 

309
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,790
this must be the thing i don't
understand

310
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800

 

311
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,870

and so they try to make that call cue or

312
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
and so they try to make that call cue or
 

313
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,469
and so they try to make that call cue or
that ikey

314
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
that ikey
 

315
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,110
that ikey
it's not just biomechanical efficiency

316
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
it's not just biomechanical efficiency
 

317
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,990
it's not just biomechanical efficiency
it's something every athlete does okay

318
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
it's something every athlete does okay
 

319
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,150
it's something every athlete does okay
another thing that every athlete does is

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
another thing that every athlete does is
 

321
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
another thing that every athlete does is
they don't waste

322
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
they don't waste
 

323
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,430
they don't waste
any energy so one of the biggest signs

324
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
any energy so one of the biggest signs
 

325
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,790
any energy so one of the biggest signs
between a world-class athlete

326
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
between a world-class athlete
 

327
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,350
between a world-class athlete
and a newbie is how much tension

328
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
and a newbie is how much tension
 

329
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,830
and a newbie is how much tension
what would be mechanical retardation

330
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
what would be mechanical retardation
 

331
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,469
what would be mechanical retardation
they have

332
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
they have

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,670
they have
in their movement so you watch a

why because they're not flexing anything

342
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
why because they're not flexing anything
 

343
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,710
why because they're not flexing anything
more than has to be flexed and

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
more than has to be flexed and
 

345
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,550
more than has to be flexed and
definitely they're not flexing anything

346
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
definitely they're not flexing anything
 

347
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,710
definitely they're not flexing anything
that has nothing to do with the movement

348
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
that has nothing to do with the movement
 

349
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,830
that has nothing to do with the movement
but a beginner always retards their

350
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
but a beginner always retards their
 

351
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,629
but a beginner always retards their
movement by

352
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
movement by
 

353
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,150
movement by
over flexion or inappropriate flexion

354
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
over flexion or inappropriate flexion
 

355
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,909
over flexion or inappropriate flexion
so um all this was

356
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
so um all this was
 

357
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,309
so um all this was
was levers and but you'll see a beginner

358
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
was levers and but you'll see a beginner
 

359
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,670
was levers and but you'll see a beginner
will still do it quite

360
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
will still do it quite
 

361
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,950
will still do it quite
tense and what i'm going to do

362
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
tense and what i'm going to do
 

363
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,550
tense and what i'm going to do
is the same thing without any

364
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
is the same thing without any
 

365
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,430
is the same thing without any
unnecessary movement

366
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
unnecessary movement
 

367
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,430
unnecessary movement
very good grip it's very easy

368
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
very good grip it's very easy
 

369
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,230
very good grip it's very easy
and that actually plays such a large

370
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
and that actually plays such a large
 

371
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,029
and that actually plays such a large
role

372
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
role
 

373
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,710
role
even in aikido that you can get away

374
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
even in aikido that you can get away
 

375
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,469
even in aikido that you can get away
with that first one that you couldn't

376
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
with that first one that you couldn't
 

377
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,390
with that first one that you couldn't
get away with

378
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
get away with
 

379
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,670
get away with
just same thing put keep your weight

380
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
just same thing put keep your weight
 

381
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,029
just same thing put keep your weight
down on it

382
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
down on it
 

383
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,909
down on it
and my flex i feel very efficient but

384
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
and my flex i feel very efficient but
 

385
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,830
and my flex i feel very efficient but
i'm way out here

386
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
i'm way out here
 

387
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,070
i'm way out here
and just lift your hand or

388
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080

 

389
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,230

he's pushing down and you're going to

390
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
he's pushing down and you're going to
 

391
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,070
he's pushing down and you're going to
want to try bring your elbows in

392
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
want to try bring your elbows in
 

393
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,390
want to try bring your elbows in
come up and you see that's all that

394
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
come up and you see that's all that
 

395
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,430
come up and you see that's all that
other stuff

396
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
other stuff
 

397
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,869
other stuff
rear posterior chain leverage

398
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
rear posterior chain leverage
 

399
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,909
rear posterior chain leverage
and a sounder geometry but again he's

400
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
and a sounder geometry but again he's
 

401
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,350
and a sounder geometry but again he's
pushing down on it

402
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
pushing down on it
 

403
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,430
pushing down on it
and just the relaxation and you can get

404
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
and just the relaxation and you can get
 

405
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,390
and just the relaxation and you can get
it up without any of that other stuff

406
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
it up without any of that other stuff
 

407
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,189
it up without any of that other stuff
okay

408
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
okay
 

409
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,390
okay
so now you're going back to this drill

410
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
so now you're going back to this drill
 

411
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,110
so now you're going back to this drill
and just let's let's have you first try

412
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
and just let's let's have you first try
 

413
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,990
and just let's let's have you first try
it close

414
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
it close
 

415
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,950
it close
so you're going to do the relaxation no

416
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
so you're going to do the relaxation no
 

417
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,230
so you're going to do the relaxation no
flexion

418
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
flexion
 

419
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,350
flexion
in the other sound biomechanical

420
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
in the other sound biomechanical
 

421
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,830
in the other sound biomechanical
geometry and as you're comfortable

422
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
geometry and as you're comfortable
 

423
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,310
geometry and as you're comfortable
you just get out from being outdoor

424
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
you just get out from being outdoor
 

425
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,070
you just get out from being outdoor
okay let's try okay so uh one of one of

426
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
okay let's try okay so uh one of one of
 

427
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,230
okay let's try okay so uh one of one of
the reasons why the new athlete

428
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
the reasons why the new athlete
 

429
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,030
the reasons why the new athlete
has unnecessary tension is they have

430
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
has unnecessary tension is they have
 

431
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,310
has unnecessary tension is they have
anxiety they

432
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
anxiety they
 

433
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,350
anxiety they
have anxiety due to the lack of

434
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,360
have anxiety due to the lack of
 

435
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,829
have anxiety due to the lack of
familiarity

436
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
familiarity
 

437
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,230
familiarity
okay so um you might have anxiety as you

438
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
okay so um you might have anxiety as you
 

439
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,590
okay so um you might have anxiety as you
try to do all your iq

440
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
try to do all your iq
 

441
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,670
try to do all your iq
because someone's grabbing you but you

442
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
because someone's grabbing you but you
 

443
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,350
because someone's grabbing you but you
will get the same

444
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
will get the same
 

445
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,190
will get the same
anxious induced flexion when you make

446
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
anxious induced flexion when you make
 

447
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,710
anxious induced flexion when you make
a combatant out of them someone that

448
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
a combatant out of them someone that
 

449
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,750
a combatant out of them someone that
you trying to overcome so if i'm here

450
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
you trying to overcome so if i'm here
 

451
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,509
you trying to overcome so if i'm here
and i i'm not like well he was not

452
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
and i i'm not like well he was not
 

453
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,350
and i i'm not like well he was not
letting me lift my hand

454
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
letting me lift my hand
 

455
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,350
letting me lift my hand
i've already started you don't realize

456
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
i've already started you don't realize
 

457
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,269
i've already started you don't realize
it but you already started flexing

458
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
it but you already started flexing
 

459
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,949
it but you already started flexing
okay so

460
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959

 

461
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,670

one of the things you can do is imagine

462
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
one of the things you can do is imagine
 

463
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,790
one of the things you can do is imagine
something different

464
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
something different
 

465
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,990
something different
so i'm not going to let my mind go into

466
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
so i'm not going to let my mind go into
 

467
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,269
so i'm not going to let my mind go into
this uh threat foe overcome

468
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
this uh threat foe overcome
 

469
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,790
this uh threat foe overcome
context i just i'm changing my mind like

470
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
context i just i'm changing my mind like
 

471
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,230
context i just i'm changing my mind like
there's something up there that i

472
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
there's something up there that i
 

473
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,590
there's something up there that i
that i want okay now a lot of people

474
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
that i want okay now a lot of people
 

475
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,190
that i want okay now a lot of people
think that because i'm using my

476
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
think that because i'm using my
 

477
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,550
think that because i'm using my
imagination that this

478
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
imagination that this
 

479
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,710
imagination that this
is then internal this is not the

480
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
is then internal this is not the
 

481
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,910
is then internal this is not the
internal aspects

482
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
internal aspects
 

483
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,949
internal aspects
i'm just using my imagination okay

484
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
i'm just using my imagination okay
 

485
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,710
i'm just using my imagination okay
so this uh the same one is here

486
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
so this uh the same one is here
 

487
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,509
so this uh the same one is here
so when he's when he's pushing down if

488
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
so when he's when he's pushing down if
 

489
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,430
so when he's when he's pushing down if
you try to overcome him you'll flex

490
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
you try to overcome him you'll flex
 

491
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,350
you try to overcome him you'll flex
things that will stop your movement

492
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
things that will stop your movement
 

493
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,470
things that will stop your movement
right so

494
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
right so
 

495
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,590
right so
instead just uh imagine your hands are

496
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
instead just uh imagine your hands are
 

497
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,069
instead just uh imagine your hands are
floating

498
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
floating
 

499
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,190
floating
up and we can do this one

500
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200

 

501
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,750

where he's on and you can use your your

502
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
where he's on and you can use your your
 

503
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,430
where he's on and you can use your your
symmetrical hand

504
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
symmetrical hand
 

505
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,350
symmetrical hand
like i want to touch my nose there's a

506
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
like i want to touch my nose there's a
 

507
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,710
like i want to touch my nose there's a
fly on my nose

508
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
fly on my nose
 

509
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,389
fly on my nose
and with my two hands i just am moving

510
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
and with my two hands i just am moving
 

511
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,350
and with my two hands i just am moving
uh my hands towards my nose to touch

512
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
uh my hands towards my nose to touch
 

513
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,310
uh my hands towards my nose to touch
that flap

514
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
that flap
 

515
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,030
that flap
i'm not trying to get him off my arm

516
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
i'm not trying to get him off my arm
 

517
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,509
i'm not trying to get him off my arm
okay

518
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
okay
 

519
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,710
okay
and again what this imagination does

520
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
and again what this imagination does
 

521
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,670
and again what this imagination does
is it helps the new person not enter

522
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
is it helps the new person not enter
 

523
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,949
is it helps the new person not enter
into that

524
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
into that
 

525
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,670
into that
threat faux overcome model which will

526
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
threat faux overcome model which will
 

527
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,030
threat faux overcome model which will
almost always induce

528
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
almost always induce
 

529
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,430
almost always induce
unnecessary flexion once you know what

530
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
unnecessary flexion once you know what
 

531
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,590
unnecessary flexion once you know what
relaxed motion feels like you don't need

532
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
relaxed motion feels like you don't need
 

533
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,870
relaxed motion feels like you don't need
your imagination

534
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
your imagination
 

535
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,190
your imagination
you can think whatever you want and get

536
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
you can think whatever you want and get
 

537
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,870
you can think whatever you want and get
it to go you can even think full

538
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
it to go you can even think full
 

539
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,710
it to go you can even think full
threat overcome and you will still move

540
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
threat overcome and you will still move
 

541
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,509
threat overcome and you will still move
correct okay

542
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
correct okay
 

543
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,670
correct okay
okay so at this point i have done

544
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
okay so at this point i have done
 

545
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,990
okay so at this point i have done
nothing external this is all external

546
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
nothing external this is all external
 

547
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,470
nothing external this is all external
stuff

548
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
stuff
 

549
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,630
stuff
even though i use my imagination i use

550
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
even though i use my imagination i use
 

551
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,350
even though i use my imagination i use
my imagination with an external aim

552
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
my imagination with an external aim
 

553
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,310
my imagination with an external aim
it's not that these things are not a

554
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
it's not that these things are not a
 

555
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,150
it's not that these things are not a
part of aikido

556
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
part of aikido
 

557
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,990
part of aikido
it's that they're not the whole of

558
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
it's that they're not the whole of
 

559
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,870
it's that they're not the whole of
aikido that is what is key what part are

560
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
aikido that is what is key what part are
 

561
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,150
aikido that is what is key what part are
they not the whole of the

562
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
they not the whole of the
 

563
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,269
they not the whole of the
internal aspects okay so um

564
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
internal aspects okay so um
 

565
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,470
internal aspects okay so um
you can get uh very high

566
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
you can get uh very high
 

567
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,269
you can get uh very high
in your skill level or in your force

568
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
by doing these things of course because
 

573
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,030
by doing these things of course because
you're biomechanically sound

574
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
you're biomechanically sound
 

575
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,430
you're biomechanically sound
all right so if we take tenshi nugget

576
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
all right so if we take tenshi nugget
 

577
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,790
all right so if we take tenshi nugget
and it's the same thing

578
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
and it's the same thing
 

579
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,949
and it's the same thing
i'm going to have more biomechanical

580
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
i'm going to have more biomechanical
 

581
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,949
i'm going to have more biomechanical
soundness the more that i'm engaging

582
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
soundness the more that i'm engaging
 

583
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,630
soundness the more that i'm engaging
that rear posterior chain

584
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
that rear posterior chain
 

585
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,430
that rear posterior chain
so the closer my elbows are to me and to

586
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
so the closer my elbows are to me and to
 

587
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,350
so the closer my elbows are to me and to
the center line to my spine

588
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
the center line to my spine
 

589
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,829
the center line to my spine
the more mechanically efficient i am the

590
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
the more mechanically efficient i am the
 

591
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,230
the more mechanically efficient i am the
less tension i have in my arms

592
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
less tension i have in my arms
 

593
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,870
less tension i have in my arms
the more uh i'm going to be mechanically

594
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
the more uh i'm going to be mechanically
 

595
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,590
the more uh i'm going to be mechanically
sound so

596
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
sound so
 

597
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,509
sound so
i'm going to do tenshi nagas the same

598
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
i'm going to do tenshi nagas the same
 

599
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,190
i'm going to do tenshi nagas the same
thing

600
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
thing
 

601
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,069
thing
arms are very loose and he will feel a

602
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
arms are very loose and he will feel a
 

603
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,230
arms are very loose and he will feel a
lot of force

604
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
lot of force
 

605
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,629
lot of force
even though the technique on my side has

606
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
even though the technique on my side has
 

607
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,590
even though the technique on my side has
very little

608
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
very little
 

609
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,190
very little
of my force output potential

okay so let's try it with these external
 

617
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,150
okay so let's try it with these external
elements

618

okay again as a beginner you are

620
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
okay again as a beginner you are
 

621
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,990
okay again as a beginner you are
manipulated by your mind

right
 

627
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,350
right
that i don't get manipulated by my ego

628
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
that i don't get manipulated by my ego
 

629

you're going to bring tension into you

644
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
you're going to bring tension into you
 

645
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,870
you're going to bring tension into you
so in the same way as i'm doing the

646
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
so in the same way as i'm doing the
 

647
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,470
so in the same way as i'm doing the
technique right when you hit here you

648
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
technique right when you hit here you
 

649
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,670
technique right when you hit here you
feel his resistance

650
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
feel his resistance
 

651
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,910
feel his resistance
that's where you flex up and you forget

652
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
that's where you flex up and you forget
 

653
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,310
that's where you flex up and you forget
the mechanical efficiency of

the mechanical efficiency of
tension free movement so it's instead of

tension free movement so it's instead of
 

657
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,389
tension free movement so it's instead of
trying to throw him use your imagination

658

if i separate things i take that cue
and i put out a force value that is

815
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,550
his
so i let his energy pass through me and

816
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
so i let his energy pass through me and
 

817
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,110
so i let his energy pass through me and
come out

818
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
come out
 

819
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,350
come out
equal to his energy and that creates

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
equal to his energy and that creates
 

821
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,430
equal to his energy and that creates
that communion or that adhesion so

822
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
that communion or that adhesion so
 

823
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,269
that communion or that adhesion so
we're going to take the same the same

824
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
we're going to take the same the same
 

825
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,030
we're going to take the same the same
technique um

826
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
technique um
 

827
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,670
technique um
of uh tenshi nugget and we're going to

828
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
of uh tenshi nugget and we're going to
 

829
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,470
of uh tenshi nugget and we're going to
do it

830
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
do it
 

831
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,150
do it
in a internal way okay

832
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
in a internal way okay
 

833
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,030
in a internal way okay
um so what you're going to see is that

834
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
um so what you're going to see is that
 

835
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,949
um so what you're going to see is that
he's not going to be ahead of me and

836
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
he's not going to be ahead of me and
 

837
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,550
he's not going to be ahead of me and
then i'm just throwing him that way

838
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
then i'm just throwing him that way
 

839
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,030
then i'm just throwing him that way
so i'll i'm going to exaggerate it so

840
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
so i'll i'm going to exaggerate it so
 

841
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,230
so i'll i'm going to exaggerate it so
you can see

842
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
you can see
 

843
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,829
you can see

845
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,470
let's have you pull so he's pulling okay
he's pulling and i'm going to start

846
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
he's pulling and i'm going to start
 

847
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:05,029
he's pulling and i'm going to start
bringing him in

848
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
bringing him in
 

849

okay try it
 

905
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,630

okay so uh open your
 

907
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,750
okay so uh open your
open your hand okay and this is what i'm

908
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
open your hand okay and this is what i'm
 

909
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,870
open your hand okay and this is what i'm
doing

911
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,070

okay now i'm not i'm not pulling him

912
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
okay now i'm not i'm not pulling him
 

913
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,510
okay now i'm not i'm not pulling him
because that'll pull up into his front

914
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
because that'll pull up into his front
 

915
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,990

you see remember he's supposed to be

918
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
you see remember he's supposed to be
 

919
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,510
you see remember he's supposed to be
pulling backwards okay

920
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
pulling backwards okay
 

921
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,830
pulling backwards okay
what i'm doing is his energy is grounded

922
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
what i'm doing is his energy is grounded
 

923
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,750
what i'm doing is his energy is grounded
my front foot and then i'm vectoring it

924
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
my front foot and then i'm vectoring it
 

925
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,510
my front foot and then i'm vectoring it
over here

926
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
over here
 

927
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,390
over here
and it becomes more like this so see his

928
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
and it becomes more like this so see his
 

929
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,870
and it becomes more like this so see his
stance

930
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880

 

931
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,270

it would be like him holding on to here

932
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
it would be like him holding on to here
 

933
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,029
it would be like him holding on to here
okay and i have a good

934
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
okay and i have a good
 

935
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,909
okay and i have a good
base and he pulls that energy because

936
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
base and he pulls that energy because
 

937
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,630
base and he pulls that energy because
that's what makes him step

938
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
that's what makes him step
 

939
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,190
that's what makes him step
it's not me doing this and leaving him

940
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200

 

941
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,230

so he's pulling pull pull

942
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
so he's pulling pull pull
 

943
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,990
so he's pulling pull pull
pull pull pull pull that's not it

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
pull pull pull pull that's not it
 

945
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,710
pull pull pull pull that's not it
okay i'm not pulling against this pull

946
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
okay i'm not pulling against this pull
 

947
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,110
okay i'm not pulling against this pull
he's

948
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
he's
 

949
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,190
he's
he's going and i'm bouncing that energy

950
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
he's going and i'm bouncing that energy
 

951
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,270
he's going and i'm bouncing that energy
off that's what makes him take that step

952
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
off that's what makes him take that step
 

953
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,430
off that's what makes him take that step
okay and i just keep doing that in

954
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
okay and i just keep doing that in
 

955
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,590
okay and i just keep doing that in
between keep bouncing bouncing bouncing

958
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
and
 

959
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,430
and
he either goes and stumbles or he

960
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
he either goes and stumbles or he
 

961
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,549
he either goes and stumbles or he
moves his face in support so boom

962
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
moves his face in support so boom
 

963
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,789
moves his face in support so boom
boom i keep moving it around moving it

964
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
boom i keep moving it around moving it
 

965
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,990
boom i keep moving it around moving it
around moving it around

966
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
around moving it around
 

967
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,270
around moving it around
moving it around now he's on my

968
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
moving it around now he's on my
 

969
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,909
moving it around now he's on my
arm up here that becomes my next

970
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
arm up here that becomes my next
 

971
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,630
arm up here that becomes my next
adhesion point

972
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
adhesion point
 

973
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,909
adhesion point
not his grip that i try to uh fulcrum

974
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
not his grip that i try to uh fulcrum
 

975
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,190

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
energy of the universe
 

1021
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,990
energy of the universe
okay try it if we go back to the

1022
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
okay try it if we go back to the
 

1023
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,830
okay try it if we go back to the
external version where i'm just

1024
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
external version where i'm just
 

1025
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,110
external version where i'm just
overpowering him uh this way you see how

1026
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
overpowering him uh this way you see how
 

1027
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,230
overpowering him uh this way you see how
he's he's standing straight up

1028
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
he's he's standing straight up
 

1029
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,190
he's he's standing straight up
until you overpower him

1030
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200

 

1031
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,190

so when you guys are in your g wasn't

1032
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
so when you guys are in your g wasn't
 

1033
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,630
so when you guys are in your g wasn't
the uke does not have to

1034
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
the uke does not have to
 

1035
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,789
the uke does not have to
stay there to be overpowered the

1036
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
stay there to be overpowered the
 

1037
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,549
stay there to be overpowered the
technique does not work

1038
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
technique does not work
 

1039
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,029
technique does not work
okay because he doesn't have to stay

1040
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
okay because he doesn't have to stay
 

1041
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,789
okay because he doesn't have to stay
there for me to be overpowered

1042
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
there for me to be overpowered
 

1043
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,830
there for me to be overpowered
i'm just pushing the guy

1044
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
i'm just pushing the guy
 

1045
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,029
i'm just pushing the guy
it doesn't work so

1046
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
it doesn't work so
 

1047
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,950
it doesn't work so
i had him pulling on me so you can see

1048
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
i had him pulling on me so you can see
 

1049
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,149
i had him pulling on me so you can see
that he is coming forward by what

1050
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
that he is coming forward by what
 

1051
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,830
that he is coming forward by what
i am doing not because of what he does

1052
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
i am doing not because of what he does
 

1053
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,909
i am doing not because of what he does
okay so for example let's say he's

1054
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
okay so for example let's say he's
 

1055
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,350
okay so for example let's say he's
coming forward i still

1056
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
coming forward i still
 

1057
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,390
coming forward i still
go boom and i try to overpower this guy

1058
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
go boom and i try to overpower this guy
 

1059
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,870
go boom and i try to overpower this guy
so maybe it's not skilled than she was

1060
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
so maybe it's not skilled than she was
 

1061
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,630
so maybe it's not skilled than she was
and they don't smell that coming

1062
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
and they don't smell that coming
 

1063
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,149
and they don't smell that coming
and they don't counter it by either

1064
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
and they don't counter it by either
 

1065
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,230
and they don't counter it by either
going under it or backing out

1066
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
going under it or backing out
 

1067
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,390
going under it or backing out
but maybe they're still too big and i'm

1068
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
but maybe they're still too big and i'm
 

1069
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,590
but maybe they're still too big and i'm
just hitting people that's not aikido

1070
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
just hitting people that's not aikido
 

1071
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,070
just hitting people that's not aikido
and it

1072
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
and it
 

1073
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,190
and it
generally does not work okay so i

1074
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
generally does not work okay so i
 

1075
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,470
generally does not work okay so i
am bringing them in to another adhesion

1076
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
am bringing them in to another adhesion
 

1077
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,110
am bringing them in to another adhesion

point
 

1079
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,190
point
so you you almost want to ignore the

1080
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
so you you almost want to ignore the
 

1081
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,789
so you you almost want to ignore the
grip find the

1082
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
grip find the
 

1083
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,070
grip find the
inner arm find the inner arm down here

1084
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
inner arm find the inner arm down here
 

1085
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,470
inner arm find the inner arm down here
and then find the hip so that he is

1086
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
and then find the hip so that he is
 

1087
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,630
and then find the hip so that he is
still going forward

1088
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
still going forward
 

1089
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,190
still going forward
i turn him from going forward and then

1090
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
i turn him from going forward and then
 

1091
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,750
i turn him from going forward and then
he heads

1092
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
he heads
 

1093
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,870
he heads
back the other way and then i enter

1094
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
back the other way and then i enter
 

1095
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,669
back the other way and then i enter
in that in space so just like the other

1096
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
in that in space so just like the other
 

1097
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,390
in that in space so just like the other

i'm doing pull i trade to the arm

1100
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
i'm doing pull i trade to the arm
 

1101

he's going that way and i step into that

1104
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,320

 

1105
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,270

i do not use the edemiachi to shove him

1106
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
i do not use the edemiachi to shove him
 

1107
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,110
i do not use the edemiachi to shove him
back

1108
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
back
 

1109
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,990
back
he needs to already be followed so the

1110
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
he needs to already be followed so the
 

1111
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,870
he needs to already be followed so the
same thing he's going forward this time

1112
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880

 

1113
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:27,190

and i'm doing the same thing

1114
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200

 

1115
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,549

not him standing straight right away he

1116
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
not him standing straight right away he
 

1117
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,190
not him standing straight right away he
tilts

1118
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
tilts
 

1119
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:43,430
tilts
and goes into the back outward position

1120
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440

 

1121
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,590

and look right away and here and here

1122
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
and look right away and here and here
 

1123
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,549
and look right away and here and here
and here

1124
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
and here
 

1125
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,350
and here
okay let's go now from the point of view

1126
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
okay let's go now from the point of view
 

1127
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,630
okay let's go now from the point of view
of kihomosa

1128
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,640

 

1129
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,430

the mechanical external stuff is very

1130
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
the mechanical external stuff is very
 

1131
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,190
the mechanical external stuff is very
important you do need to learn that

1132
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
important you do need to learn that
 

1133
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,110
important you do need to learn that
but like i said it's not the whole of

1134
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
but like i said it's not the whole of
 

1135
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,549
but like i said it's not the whole of

the art and
 

1137
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,830

the higher aspects of the art
are these internalized energetic
