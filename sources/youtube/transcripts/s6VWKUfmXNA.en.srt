1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,030

and what i want you to work on

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
and what i want you to work on
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,230
and what i want you to work on
is the equal and opposite energy that

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
is the equal and opposite energy that
 

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,870
is the equal and opposite energy that
comes from hitting someone

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
comes from hitting someone
 

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,830
comes from hitting someone
if that energy leaks out my body i will

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
if that energy leaks out my body i will
 

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,789
if that energy leaks out my body i will
not have mass displacement of my strife

10
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
not have mass displacement of my strife
 

11
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,910
not have mass displacement of my strife
and we need mass displacement okay

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
and we need mass displacement okay
 

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,510
and we need mass displacement okay
so yes body alignment

14
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
so yes body alignment
 

15
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,790
so yes body alignment
yes dropping the chi

16
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
yes dropping the chi
 

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,230
yes dropping the chi
yes fist formation yes skeletal

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
yes fist formation yes skeletal
 

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,269
yes fist formation yes skeletal
alignment

20
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
alignment
 

21
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,030
alignment
but it's more what do i do with that

22
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
but it's more what do i do with that
 

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,790
but it's more what do i do with that
energy coming back which is why you have

24
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
energy coming back which is why you have
 

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,389
energy coming back which is why you have
a spring in your monkey water

26
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399

 

27
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,270

i want to feel that force come in me hit

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
i want to feel that force come in me hit
 

29
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:54,950
i want to feel that force come in me hit
the ground

30
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960

 

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,270

and when i receive the force

32
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
and when i receive the force
 

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,910
and when i receive the force
everything's got to be relaxed

34
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
everything's got to be relaxed
 

35
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:12,390
everything's got to be relaxed
so i'm not good i don't want to tense

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
so i'm not good i don't want to tense
 

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,429
so i'm not good i don't want to tense
and this is just a little test of it so

38
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
and this is just a little test of it so
 

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,710
and this is just a little test of it so
again i'm not trying to kill him

40
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
again i'm not trying to kill him
 

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,950
again i'm not trying to kill him
so i'm not working on punching him hard

42
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
so i'm not working on punching him hard
 

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:31,270
so i'm not working on punching him hard
but i'm now looking for the displacement

44
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280

 

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,830

okay i'm not pushing him

46
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
okay i'm not pushing him
 

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,130
okay i'm not pushing him
it's it's still a ballistic

48
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,140
it's it's still a ballistic
 

49
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,350
it's it's still a ballistic
[Music]

50
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
[Music]
 

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,590
[Music]
but it's got that displacing potential

52
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
but it's got that displacing potential
 

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,710
but it's got that displacing potential
so you don't push

54
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
so you don't push
 

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,830
so you don't push
you don't have to punch them hard you're

56
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

57
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,910

just

58
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920

 

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,310

okay let's go okay so uh

60
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
okay let's go okay so uh
 

61
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,030
okay let's go okay so uh
we if he if he's grabbed we have this

62
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
we if he if he's grabbed we have this
 

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,709
we if he if he's grabbed we have this
cochlear training drill right so

64
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
cochlear training drill right so
 

65
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,749
cochlear training drill right so
here is a kind of uh fixated

66
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
here is a kind of uh fixated
 

67
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,750
here is a kind of uh fixated
movement uh generated force so he

68
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
movement uh generated force so he
 

69
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,229
movement uh generated force so he
he's pushing and and that force is going

70
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
he's pushing and and that force is going
 

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,949
he's pushing and and that force is going
down to the ground path on the back foot

72
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959

 

73
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,190

that's what's happening here so when you

74
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
that's what's happening here so when you
 

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,390
that's what's happening here so when you
hit his body

76
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
hit his body
 

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,990
hit his body
it has uh weight and matter

78
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
it has uh weight and matter
 

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,190
it has uh weight and matter
and it's an energy that i have to

80
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
and it's an energy that i have to
 

81
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,110
and it's an energy that i have to
override um and so there's going to be

82
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
override um and so there's going to be
 

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,229
override um and so there's going to be
some return energy some equal and

84
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
some return energy some equal and
 

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,670
some return energy some equal and
opposite energy bond

86
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
opposite energy bond
 

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,430
opposite energy bond
to me but that force that comes back

88
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
to me but that force that comes back
 

89
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,550
to me but that force that comes back
i ground this same thing

90
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
i ground this same thing
 

91
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,190
i ground this same thing
that force is coming towards me i ground

92
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
that force is coming towards me i ground
 

93
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,670
that force is coming towards me i ground
so

94
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
so
 

95
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,670
so
he's pushing really really hard come on

96
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
he's pushing really really hard come on
 

97
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,030
he's pushing really really hard come on
dude knock me down

98
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
dude knock me down
 

99
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,550
dude knock me down
knock me down that that's what i'm doing

100
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
knock me down that that's what i'm doing
 

101
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,750
knock me down that that's what i'm doing
it's just really fast okay i don't it's

102
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
it's just really fast okay i don't it's
 

103
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,750
it's just really fast okay i don't it's
not fixated movement it's ballistic

104
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
not fixated movement it's ballistic
 

105
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,550
not fixated movement it's ballistic
movement

106
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
movement
 

107
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,229
movement
okay so that that's what i'm doing so

108
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
okay so that that's what i'm doing so
 

109
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,990
okay so that that's what i'm doing so
i don't want you because right now

110
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
i don't want you because right now
 

111
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,350
i don't want you because right now
you're somebody you're

112
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
you're somebody you're
 

113
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,149
you're somebody you're
leaning and it's while once you move you

114
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
leaning and it's while once you move you
 

115
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,430
leaning and it's while once you move you
kind of stumble

116
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
kind of stumble
 

117
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,509
kind of stumble
that's that's not what we're doing okay

118
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
that's that's not what we're doing okay
 

119
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,030
that's that's not what we're doing okay
so we're gonna we'll take away

120
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
so we're gonna we'll take away
 

121
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,869
so we're gonna we'll take away
my base and i will have

122
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879

 

123
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,509

same energies here just like he's

124
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
same energies here just like he's
 

125
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,229
same energies here just like he's
pushing

126
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
pushing
 

127
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,110
pushing
he's pushing there's energy there and i

128
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
he's pushing there's energy there and i
 

129
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,630
he's pushing there's energy there and i
ground i ground me

130
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
ground i ground me
 

131
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,110
ground i ground me
okay i'm grounded so he's pushing really

132
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
okay i'm grounded so he's pushing really
 

133
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,110
okay i'm grounded so he's pushing really
hard really hard really hard really hard

134
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
hard really hard really hard really hard
 

135
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,229
hard really hard really hard really hard
really hard really hard really hard i'm

136
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
really hard really hard really hard i'm
 

137
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,190
really hard really hard really hard i'm
grounding

138
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
grounding
 

139
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,309
grounding
on that foot so when i come back in his

140
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
on that foot so when i come back in his
 

141
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,110
on that foot so when i come back in his
mass that equal opposite energy comes

142
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
mass that equal opposite energy comes
 

143
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,309
mass that equal opposite energy comes
back it growls

144
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
back it growls
 

145
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,509
back it growls
and it will displace it

146
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519

 

147
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,270

okay so i don't you have less

148
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
okay so i don't you have less
 

149
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,670
okay so i don't you have less
urgency or feeling that you could lean

150
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
urgency or feeling that you could lean
 

151
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,030
urgency or feeling that you could lean
you're just here

152
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040

 

153
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,670

okay let's go so um

154
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680

 

155
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,830

when our when our strikes are surface

156
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
when our when our strikes are surface
 

157
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,990
when our when our strikes are surface
level

158
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
level
 

159
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,670
level
um there's a couple of things the guy is

160
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
um there's a couple of things the guy is
 

161
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,789
um there's a couple of things the guy is
going to be standing where that is and a

162
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
going to be standing where that is and a
 

163
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,430
going to be standing where that is and a
lot of people that do striking arts

164
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
lot of people that do striking arts
 

165
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,510
lot of people that do striking arts
they're kind of doing more like a pain

166
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
they're kind of doing more like a pain
 

167
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,510
they're kind of doing more like a pain
compliance technique

168
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
compliance technique
 

169
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,430
compliance technique
and meaning like oh that's gonna hurt

170
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440

okay this thing is going to come in
 

317
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,670
okay this thing is going to come in
into my energy and i am projecting now

318
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
into my energy and i am projecting now
 

319
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,950
into my energy and i am projecting now
holistically

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
holistically
 

321
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,830
holistically
so so far your grabs is fixated

00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
ballistic
 

325
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,670
ballistic
uh fixated projection boom energy is

326
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
uh fixated projection boom energy is
 

327
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,869
uh fixated projection boom energy is
fixated

328
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
fixated
 

329
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,710
fixated
this is ballistic same thing

330
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
this is ballistic same thing
 

331
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,950
this is ballistic same thing
okay that that's what we're trying to do

332

all right so let's give it a shot of
 

335
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:04,950
all right so let's give it a shot of
this

336
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
