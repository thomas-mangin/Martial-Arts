give more space do you see and that's
when i use that space

120
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
when i use that space
 

121
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,430
when i use that space
to get out

122
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440

 

123
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,589

to do anything
 

127
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,750
to do anything
okay let's go into detail

128
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
okay let's go into detail
 

129
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,430
okay let's go into detail
uh by combining non-contestation

130
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
uh by combining non-contestation
 

131
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,229
uh by combining non-contestation
with what was said on top

132
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
with what was said on top
 

133
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,990
with what was said on top
okay

134
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
okay
 

135
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,350
okay
so i'm on top

136
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360

 

137
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,750

and we were saying

138
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
and we were saying
 

139
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,309
and we were saying
that it made no sense

140
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
that it made no sense
 

141
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,949
that it made no sense
to go from a position of advantage and

142
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
to go from a position of advantage and
 

143
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,710
to go from a position of advantage and
lots of control

144
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
lots of control
 

145
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,190
lots of control
to start opening it up that would be a

146
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
to start opening it up that would be a
 

147
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,990
to start opening it up that would be a
position of disadvantage okay

148
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
position of disadvantage okay
 

149
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,429
position of disadvantage okay
so

150
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
so
 

151
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,070
so
if i have all this control what the

152
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
if i have all this control what the
 

153
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,190
if i have all this control what the
student doesn't understand is

154
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
student doesn't understand is
 

155
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,949
student doesn't understand is
uh we were

156
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
uh we were
 

157
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,350
uh we were
practicing or drilling

158
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
practicing or drilling
 

159
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,550
practicing or drilling
pressure

160
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
pressure
 

161
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,070
pressure
you see

162
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
you see
 

163
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,030
you see
and we gave a utility to it you want to

164
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
and we gave a utility to it you want to
 

165
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,949
and we gave a utility to it you want to
control his arms for weapons and things

166
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
control his arms for weapons and things
 

167
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,990
control his arms for weapons and things
like that

168
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
like that
 

169
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,870
like that
but then your mind filled it in with

170
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
but then your mind filled it in with
 

171
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,909
but then your mind filled it in with
uh

172
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
uh
 

173
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,110
uh
agency

174
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
agency
 

175

568
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440

 

569
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,910

remember in the same way

570
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920

 

571
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,069

as i was transitioning to different

as i was transitioning to different
 

573

as i was transitioning to different
points of control

574
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
points of control
 

575
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,670
points of control
that your

576
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
that your
 

577
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,269
that your
tactics

578
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
tactics
 

579
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,069
tactics
are

580
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
are
 

581
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,350
are
interdependent that they're looming okay

582
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
interdependent that they're looming okay
 

583
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,430
interdependent that they're looming okay
i don't know how you got there with her

584
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
i don't know how you got there with her
 

585
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,590
i don't know how you got there with her
but at some point

586
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
but at some point
 

587
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,470
but at some point
she

588
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
she
 

589
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,269
she
wasn't necessarily reaching for weapons

590
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
wasn't necessarily reaching for weapons
 

591
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,069
wasn't necessarily reaching for weapons
but

592
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
but
 

593
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,069
but
she had

594
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
she had
 

595
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,470
she had
a bear hug do you remember

596
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
a bear hug do you remember
 

597
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,750
a bear hug do you remember
and again

598
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
and again
 

599
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,949
and again
looks like

600
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
looks like
 

601
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,829
looks like
can't get the arms but look boom

602
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
can't get the arms but look boom
 

603
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,190
can't get the arms but look boom
boom oh there look there came

604
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
boom oh there look there came
 

605
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,310
boom oh there look there came
okay

606
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
okay
 

607
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,910
okay
and you're gonna get it again you can do

608
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
and you're gonna get it again you can do
 

609
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,670
and you're gonna get it again you can do
the same one just attack the wrist

610
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680

 

611
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,590

so

612
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
so
 

613
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,710
so
it only appears to be an obstacle

614
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
it only appears to be an obstacle
 

615
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,590
it only appears to be an obstacle
and

616
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
and
 

617
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,310
and
it's a mindset where

618
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
it's a mindset where
 

619
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,670
it's a mindset where
you're trying to

620
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
you're trying to
 

621
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,350
you're trying to
not get

622
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
not get
 

623
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,629
not get
blocked

624
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
blocked
 

625
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,829
blocked
or trying to get out of

626
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
or trying to get out of
 

627
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,710
or trying to get out of
obstacles or prevent them from occurring

628
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
obstacles or prevent them from occurring
 

629
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,269
obstacles or prevent them from occurring
but that's not jujitsu

630
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
but that's not jujitsu
 

631
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,069
but that's not jujitsu
as they do their thing it presents an

632
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
as they do their thing it presents an
 

633
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,190
as they do their thing it presents an
opportunity which is visible

634
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
opportunity which is visible
 

635
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,750
opportunity which is visible
when you release okay

636
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
when you release okay
 

637
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,389
when you release okay
so when you're rolling that is primarily

638
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
so when you're rolling that is primarily
 

639
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,389
so when you're rolling that is primarily
the point of rolling

640
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
the point of rolling
 

641
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,750
the point of rolling
not tapping them out

642
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
not tapping them out
 

643
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,230
not tapping them out
through any other means then let the

644
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
through any other means then let the
 

645
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,629
through any other means then let the
opportunity present itself

646
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
opportunity present itself
 

647
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,550
opportunity present itself
find the easy solution okay

648
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
find the easy solution okay
 

649
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,110
find the easy solution okay
then you would train her oh

650
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
then you would train her oh
 

651
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,230
then you would train her oh
don't don't put your arms away from your

652

don't don't put your arms away from your

654
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
face because they're just gonna knock me
 

655
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,310
face because they're just gonna knock me
out and then they're gonna do whatever

656
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
out and then they're gonna do whatever
 

657
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,230
out and then they're gonna do whatever
they want okay

658
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
