135
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,190

so you finally narrow it down to a few

136
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
so you finally narrow it down to a few
 

137
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,430
so you finally narrow it down to a few
bricks you might take the bricks home

138
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
bricks you might take the bricks home
 

139
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,630

put them out straight away

140
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
put them out straight away

you'll wonder why you've chosen one if

142
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
you'll wonder why you've chosen one if
 

143
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,190
you'll wonder why you've chosen one if
you've got four bricks you might think

144
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
you've got four bricks you might think
 

145
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,149
you've got four bricks you might think
straight away oh

146
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
straight away oh
 

147
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,830
straight away oh
why did i choose that one that

148
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
why did i choose that one that
 

149
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,509
why did i choose that one that
definitely

150
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
definitely
 

151
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,830

yeah is it in a better light that you've

152
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
yeah is it in a better light that you've
 

153
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,070
yeah is it in a better light that you've
seen it

154
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
seen it
 

155
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,750
seen it
so aikido is no different than choosing

156
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
so aikido is no different than choosing
 

157
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,470
so aikido is no different than choosing
the bricks for your house

158

the bricks for your house
 

159
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,589
the bricks for your house
but one is no good but when you narrow

160
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
but one is no good but when you narrow
 

161
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,550
but one is no good but when you narrow
it down

162
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
it down
 

163
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,190
it down
and i narrowed down sight of scentsy

164
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200

 

165
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,110

he made the most sense all the time

166

i never got confused by him because he

168
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
i never got confused by him because he
 

169
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,550
i never got confused by him because he
was quite a simple man and he spoke my
