00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
as he keeps resisting and I keep taking
 

355
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,930
as he keeps resisting and I keep taking
his resistance

356
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
his resistance
 

357
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,150
his resistance
projecting It Forward each time so I'm

358
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,160
projecting It Forward each time so I'm
 

359
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,290
projecting It Forward each time so I'm
not using spring okay

360
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:27,300

 

361
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,829

so as I'm doing the technique

362
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839

 

363
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,230

it might look like I pulled down but

364
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
it might look like I pulled down but
 

365
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,389
it might look like I pulled down but
when you compare it it's I'm clearly not

366
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
when you compare it it's I'm clearly not
 

367
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,389
when you compare it it's I'm clearly not
falling down okay I'm more projecting

368
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:41,399
falling down okay I'm more projecting
 

369
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,650
falling down okay I'm more projecting
out

370
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:42,660
out
 

371
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,550
out
hello so you're here you you take it to

372
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
hello so you're here you you take it to
 

373
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,009
hello so you're here you you take it to
where his resistance is and then that

374
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:49,019
where his resistance is and then that
 

375
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,269
where his resistance is and then that
resistance boom you keep rejecting it

376
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
resistance boom you keep rejecting it
 

377
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,490
resistance boom you keep rejecting it
is at the speed of life

378
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,500
is at the speed of life
 

379
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,150
is at the speed of life
so it looks fluid

380
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
so it looks fluid
 

381
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,949
so it looks fluid
and you stay up with it

382
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
and you stay up with it
 

383
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,470
and you stay up with it
so in other words you can't do one

384
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,480
so in other words you can't do one
 

385
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,730
so in other words you can't do one
projection

386
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:04,740
projection
 

387
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,009
projection
because you'll lose it

388
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:07,019
because you'll lose it
 

389
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,530
because you'll lose it
but I'm not pulling down on it this is

390
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:09,540
but I'm not pulling down on it this is
 

391
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,610
but I'm not pulling down on it this is
my hand stays up with his falling hat

392
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:13,620
my hand stays up with his falling hat
 

393
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,050
my hand stays up with his falling hat
I'm not falling down on his hand

394
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,060

398
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:41,459

 

399
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:51,230

okay let's try cast your cut out

400
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,240

 

401
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,230

okay so this this movement alone takes

402
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
okay so this this movement alone takes
 

403
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,670
okay so this this movement alone takes

405
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,910
in boxer
that makes him go backwards

406
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:58,920
that makes him go backwards
 

407
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,329
that makes him go backwards
it's not it's not this one okay so

408
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:02,339
it's not it's not this one okay so
 

409
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,910
it's not it's not this one okay so
you're you're in his body making his

410
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
you're you're in his body making his

body go down
 

413
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,110
body go down
and I just tell you that so you can

414
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
and I just tell you that so you can
 

415
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,670
and I just tell you that so you can
psychologically

psychologically
 

417
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,650
psychologically
give up some of this because if you grab

418
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:15,660
give up some of this because if you grab
 

419
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,930
give up some of this because if you grab
the forearm you're not going to have

420
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:17,940
the forearm you're not going to have
 

421
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,630
the forearm you're not going to have

I get here
 

435
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,110
I get here
uh he's gonna he's gonna resist

436
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
uh he's gonna he's gonna resist
 

437
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,250
uh he's gonna he's gonna resist
you see okay people resist

438
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,260
you see okay people resist
 

439
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,670
you see okay people resist
I don't want you to picture that this is

440
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:46,680
I don't want you to picture that this is
 

441
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,129
I don't want you to picture that this is
an external and I send it out you see my

442
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:49,139
an external and I send it out you see my
 

443
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,829
an external and I send it out you see my
Center comes up what's happening is as

444
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
Center comes up what's happening is as
 

445
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,350
Center comes up what's happening is as
he as he resists

446
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
he as he resists
 

447
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,230
he as he resists
I protect that energy back into the

448
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,240
I protect that energy back into the
 

449
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,490
I protect that energy back into the
ground

450
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:58,500
ground
 

451
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,370
ground
and project it out that's that's what I

452
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,380
and project it out that's that's what I
 

453
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,170
and project it out that's that's what I
was trying to say is that in this

454
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,180
was trying to say is that in this
 

455
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,129
was trying to say is that in this
technique

456
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:04,139
technique
 

457
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,430
technique
you see he's trying to stand up okay but

458
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
you see he's trying to stand up okay but
 

459
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,129
you see he's trying to stand up okay but
I keep taking it Forward I don't try to

460
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:10,139
I keep taking it Forward I don't try to
 

461
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,629
I keep taking it Forward I don't try to
shove that down

462
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:11,639
shove that down
 

463
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,230
shove that down
as he tries to stand up I project it

464
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,240
as he tries to stand up I project it
 

465
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,350
as he tries to stand up I project it
forward and just incrementally

466
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
forward and just incrementally
 

467
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,129
forward and just incrementally
into the uh Circle that you you all know

468
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:22,139
into the uh Circle that you you all know
 

469
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,810
into the uh Circle that you you all know
but it doesn't look like this you see

470
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:23,820
but it doesn't look like this you see
 

471
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,490
but it doesn't look like this you see
how I came up and tried to get over the

472
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:25,500
how I came up and tried to get over the
 

473
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,150
how I came up and tried to get over the
top

474
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
top
 

475
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,550
top
and it's not one thing where I shove

476
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
and it's not one thing where I shove
 

477
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,730
and it's not one thing where I shove
them down and he gets Slinky as as he's

478
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:31,740
them down and he gets Slinky as as he's
 

479
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,650
them down and he gets Slinky as as he's
trying to get up I just keep going this

480
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:33,660
trying to get up I just keep going this
 

481
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,250
trying to get up I just keep going this
way body acts in unison

482
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,260
way body acts in unison
 

483
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,910
way body acts in unison
same thing here

484
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920

 

485
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,670

whoa there it is right there that little

486
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
whoa there it is right there that little
 

487
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,150
whoa there it is right there that little
thing and

488
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,160

 

489
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,090

if he gets another foot on the ground I

490
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,100
if he gets another foot on the ground I
 

491
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,990
if he gets another foot on the ground I
keep projecting it into this spiral

492
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000

 

493
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,290

oh there it is

494
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:57,300

 

495
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,610

so a couple things to note is I'm not

496
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:01,620
so a couple things to note is I'm not
 

497
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,069
so a couple things to note is I'm not
going to do it

498
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:03,079
going to do it
 

499
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,610
going to do it
externally do you see that

500
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:07,620
externally do you see that
 

501
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,009
externally do you see that
not going to do it externally Center

502
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:10,019
not going to do it externally Center
 

503
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,569
not going to do it externally Center
came up

504
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:11,579
came up
 

505
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,769
came up
but

506
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
but
 

507
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,069
but
I also aren't going to pull down so that

508
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
I also aren't going to pull down so that
 

509
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,769
I also aren't going to pull down so that
my I don't have to ID me at all because

510
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:18,779
my I don't have to ID me at all because
 

511
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,810
my I don't have to ID me at all because
I don't have to stay up with him I am

512
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:20,820
I don't have to stay up with him I am
 

513
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,490
I don't have to stay up with him I am
projecting him out

514
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:22,500
projecting him out
 

515
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,490
projecting him out
just like if your dog

516
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,500
just like if your dog
 

517
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,329
just like if your dog
okay if I he tries to stand up

518
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:29,339
okay if I he tries to stand up
 

519
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,970
okay if I he tries to stand up
right I'm not gonna stay still he stands

520
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:31,980
right I'm not gonna stay still he stands
 

521
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,790
right I'm not gonna stay still he stands
up boom if I did not move

522
