weapon hand now in iido the syllabus the

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
weapon hand now in iido the syllabus the
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,870
weapon hand now in iido the syllabus the
way it's built there's a lot of focus on

10
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
way it's built there's a lot of focus on
 

11
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,190
way it's built there's a lot of focus on
the weapon arm but that doesn't mean

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
the weapon arm but that doesn't mean
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,269
the weapon arm but that doesn't mean
that they're always going to not check

14
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
that they're always going to not check
 

15
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,429
that they're always going to not check
your weapon arm and we could say that

16
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:20,439
your weapon arm and we could say that
 

17
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:21,870
your weapon arm and we could say that
well if they don't check our weapon arm

18
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:21,880
well if they don't check our weapon arm
 

19
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,870

that is bad for them but the problem is
 

25
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,109
that is bad for them but the problem is

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,510
right so I go like this bang bang now if
he got his way maybe he would grab my

94
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
he got his way maybe he would grab my
 

95
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,709

wrist right or going to EO right so but

96
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719
wrist right or going to EO right so but
 

97
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,270
wrist right or going to EO right so but
he he's going to do something that has

98
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280

99
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,870

that all the time in iido okay now what
 

103
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,990
that all the time in iido okay now what
if though I hit him and immediately

104
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
if though I hit him and immediately
 

105
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,789
if though I hit him and immediately
after he just comes and hits my body or

106
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:57,799
after he just comes and hits my body or
 

107
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,550
after he just comes and hits my body or
ignores my hand totally and comes gets

108
00:01:59,550 --> 00:01:59,560
ignores my hand totally and comes gets
 

109
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,029
ignores my hand totally and comes gets
my body right so Josh just ignores the

my body right so Josh just ignores the
 

111
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,670
my body right so Josh just ignores the

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
does iido have answers for that okay
 

115
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,229
does iido have answers for that okay
while I think pretty much across Styles

116
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
while I think pretty much across Styles
 

117
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,510
while I think pretty much across Styles
I mean there might be some some some

118
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:12,520
I mean there might be some some some
 

119
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,030
I mean there might be some some some
styles that I was going to say lesser

120
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
styles that I was going to say lesser
 

121
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,110
styles that I was going to say lesser
Styles I'm saying lesser not because the

122
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,120
Styles I'm saying lesser not because the
 

123
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,350
Styles I'm saying lesser not because the
style is less important but just because

124
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,360
style is less important but just because
 

125
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,790
style is less important but just because
it's not as known there might be some

126
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
it's not as known there might be some
 

127
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,750
it's not as known there might be some
lesser styles that have that in them I

128
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
lesser styles that have that in them I
 

129
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,030
lesser styles that have that in them I
don't I don't know that they do though

130
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
don't I don't know that they do though
 

131
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,710
don't I don't know that they do though
but iido does have answers for that so

132
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:25,720
but iido does have answers for that so
 

133
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,430
but iido does have answers for that so
the basic answer for any wide position

134
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440
the basic answer for any wide position
 

135
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,550
the basic answer for any wide position
in iido is a to maintain my Inner Space

136
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
in iido is a to maintain my Inner Space
 

137
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,670
in iido is a to maintain my Inner Space
okay now I often do that with a strike

138
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,680
okay now I often do that with a strike
 

139
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,270
okay now I often do that with a strike
to the face or any kind of push to the

140
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
to the face or any kind of push to the
 

141
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,630
to the face or any kind of push to the
core that that moves me away from his

142
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
core that that moves me away from his
 

143
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,430
core that that moves me away from his
body and then I try and angle on that

144
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,440
body and then I try and angle on that
 

145
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,430
body and then I try and angle on that
now if I do what I just did right now so

146
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
now if I do what I just did right now so
 

147
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,149
now if I do what I just did right now so
now I got enough room that I could get

148
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
now I got enough room that I could get
 

149
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,509
now I got enough room that I could get
by this then I would get by that if I

150
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:48,519
by this then I would get by that if I
 

151
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,030
by this then I would get by that if I
cannot do that right so his arms are

152
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
cannot do that right so his arms are
 

153
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,390
cannot do that right so his arms are
really long or something then I try to

154
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
really long or something then I try to
 

155
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,949
really long or something then I try to
shoot uchim moari right and that's why

156
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
shoot uchim moari right and that's why
 

157
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,750
shoot uchim moari right and that's why
we have uchim marari in the system so

158
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,760
we have uchim marari in the system so
 

159
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,149
we have uchim marari in the system so
that's what the system is saying about

160
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:56,159
that's what the system is saying about
 

161
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,710
that's what the system is saying about
any time they come to get your body like

162
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
any time they come to get your body like
 

163
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,750
any time they come to get your body like
that they come wide around you okay so

164
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:00,760
that they come wide around you okay so
 

165
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,910
that they come wide around you okay so
in this situation say I come to hit Josh

166
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:02,920
in this situation say I come to hit Josh
 

167
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,390
in this situation say I come to hit Josh
here and he comes in inside of me one

168
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,400
here and he comes in inside of me one
 

169
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,390
here and he comes in inside of me one
thing I can do is drop my elbow right in

170
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,400
thing I can do is drop my elbow right in
 

171
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,030
thing I can do is drop my elbow right in
here and this elbow keeps him from

172
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
here and this elbow keeps him from
 

173
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,830
here and this elbow keeps him from
getting too too tight to me right so uh

174
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
getting too too tight to me right so uh
 

175
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,070
getting too too tight to me right so uh
I'm I'm just creating a little space

176
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm I'm just creating a little space
 

177
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,229
I'm I'm just creating a little space
here with my elbow now the reason I'm

178
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
here with my elbow now the reason I'm
 

179
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,309
here with my elbow now the reason I'm
doing is because my weapon hands already

180
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
doing is because my weapon hands already
 

181
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,550
doing is because my weapon hands already
out here like this and as he comes in I

182
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,560
out here like this and as he comes in I
 

183
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,430
out here like this and as he comes in I
come down and I try and stop him here on

184
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
come down and I try and stop him here on
 

185
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,229
come down and I try and stop him here on
the weapon side and then from here I'm

186
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:23,239
the weapon side and then from here I'm
 

187
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,110
the weapon side and then from here I'm
going to work out in any number of ways

188
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
going to work out in any number of ways
 

189
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,830
going to work out in any number of ways
right so if I could just push my body

190
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:26,840
right so if I could just push my body
 

191
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,509
right so if I could just push my body
out wide enough to pass the arm then I

192
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
out wide enough to pass the arm then I
 

193
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,550
out wide enough to pass the arm then I
could pass the arm if I can't do that

194
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
could pass the arm if I can't do that
 

195
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,710
could pass the arm if I can't do that
then maybe I'm going to press on that

196
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720
then maybe I'm going to press on that
 

197
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,589
then maybe I'm going to press on that
face and get out with a proper triangle

198
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
face and get out with a proper triangle
 

199
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,390
face and get out with a proper triangle
right so I'm going to use a proper

200
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
right so I'm going to use a proper
 

201
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,589
right so I'm going to use a proper
triangle to get out of there could be

202
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:36,599
triangle to get out of there could be
 

203
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,509
triangle to get out of there could be
that as I come up Josh defends this top

204
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
that as I come up Josh defends this top
 

205
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,789
that as I come up Josh defends this top
and then he slides down around my arm

206
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:41,799
and then he slides down around my arm
 

207
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,910
and then he slides down around my arm
right okay now this is bad because it

208
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
right okay now this is bad because it
 

209
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,309
right okay now this is bad because it
really neutralizes a lot of this arm as

210
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
really neutralizes a lot of this arm as
 

211
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,390
really neutralizes a lot of this arm as
he does it and I can get caught that way

212
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
he does it and I can get caught that way
 

213
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,630
he does it and I can get caught that way
right and so it can be hard to go from

214
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
right and so it can be hard to go from
 

215
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,910
right and so it can be hard to go from
here to shoot it in here because he's

216
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:52,920
here to shoot it in here because he's
 

217
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,069
here to shoot it in here because he's
connected to my arm right okay so what

218
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,079
connected to my arm right okay so what
 

219
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,670
connected to my arm right okay so what
you have to try to do and this is

220
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,680
you have to try to do and this is
 

221
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,550
you have to try to do and this is
difficult is shoot this hand across your

222
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
difficult is shoot this hand across your
 

223
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,390
difficult is shoot this hand across your
body as you turn your hips now you can't

224
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
body as you turn your hips now you can't
 

225
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,670
body as you turn your hips now you can't
just do this because you're going to be

226
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
just do this because you're going to be
 

227
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,429
just do this because you're going to be
in two week of position to do anything

228
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
in two week of position to do anything
 

229
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,550
in two week of position to do anything
you have to rotate your hips as you're

230
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,560
you have to rotate your hips as you're
 

231
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,309
you have to rotate your hips as you're
doing that and so what happens is as

232
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
doing that and so what happens is as
 

233
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,949
doing that and so what happens is as
Josh is coming in watch what'll happen

234
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
Josh is coming in watch what'll happen
 

235
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,789
Josh is coming in watch what'll happen
I'll go right across his face and then I

236
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
I'll go right across his face and then I
 

237
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,710
I'll go right across his face and then I
can push myself out to the long side now

238
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:13,720
can push myself out to the long side now
 

239
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,390
can push myself out to the long side now
preferably all the times when you're

240
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,400
preferably all the times when you're
 

241
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,749
preferably all the times when you're
doing that you want to be non weapon

242
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:18,759
doing that you want to be non weapon
 

243
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,629
doing that you want to be non weapon
side forward to him and you want to do

00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:21,639
side forward to him and you want to do
 

245
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,870
side forward to him and you want to do

247
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,230
it so you're always headed to his back
right now let me let me explain what I

248
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,240
right now let me let me explain what I
 

249
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,550
right now let me let me explain what I
mean okay so here I'm headed towards

250
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,560

Josh's back so this is Ion me right I

252
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
Josh's back so this is Ion me right I
 

253
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,390
Josh's back so this is Ion me right I
don't know if you guys you know like a

254
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,400
don't know if you guys you know like a
 

255
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,070
don't know if you guys you know like a
lot of times when we'll be in positions

256
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080
lot of times when we'll be in positions
 

257
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,990
lot of times when we'll be in positions
like this is Ion me right but you might

258
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,000
like this is Ion me right but you might
 

259
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,230
like this is Ion me right but you might
not recognize it because it doesn't look

260
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
not recognize it because it doesn't look
 

261
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,550
not recognize it because it doesn't look
like a really strict rigid Hy now the

262
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:39,560
like a really strict rigid Hy now the
 

263
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,310
like a really strict rigid Hy now the
reason I want to be in this position is

264
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,320
reason I want to be in this position is
 

265
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,670
reason I want to be in this position is
because when I'm hitting him there's

266
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
because when I'm hitting him there's
 

267
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,469
because when I'm hitting him there's
nothing to defend him back here right

268
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:45,479
nothing to defend him back here right
 

269
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,350
nothing to defend him back here right
all of his tools to defend him is this

270
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
all of his tools to defend him is this
 

271
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,749
all of his tools to defend him is this
way right so if we were in yakui like

272
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
way right so if we were in yakui like
 

273
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,909
way right so if we were in yakui like
this as I'm hitting him you see there's

274
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
this as I'm hitting him you see there's
 

275
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,469
this as I'm hitting him you see there's
everything's there to defend me and so I

276
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
everything's there to defend me and so I
 

277
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,390
everything's there to defend me and so I
or defend him so I can't really get

278
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
or defend him so I can't really get
 

279
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,590
or defend him so I can't really get
successful weapon hits and my weapon is

280
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:58,600
successful weapon hits and my weapon is
 

281
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,590
successful weapon hits and my weapon is
always right where he is and so that's

282
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:00,600
always right where he is and so that's
 

283
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,310
always right where he is and so that's
no good I don't want that so I want my

284
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
no good I don't want that so I want my
 

285
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,310
no good I don't want that so I want my
weapon side back and I want to be in

286
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
weapon side back and I want to be in
 

287
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,510
weapon side back and I want to be in
this configuration where I'm headed to

288
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
this configuration where I'm headed to
 

289
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,629
this configuration where I'm headed to
his back side so if if possible I always

290
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
his back side so if if possible I always
 

291
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,430
his back side so if if possible I always
want to be an ihon me so that's why our

292
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,440
want to be an ihon me so that's why our
 

293
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,270
want to be an ihon me so that's why our
triangle should come off like this and

294
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,280
triangle should come off like this and
 

295
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,749
triangle should come off like this and
our triangle shouldn't come off like

296
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
our triangle shouldn't come off like
 

297
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,310
our triangle shouldn't come off like
this this is not a triangle right and

298
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,320
this this is not a triangle right and
 

299
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,070
this this is not a triangle right and
the reason is because it's not as useful

300
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,080
the reason is because it's not as useful
 

301
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,670
the reason is because it's not as useful
for me right even if I had the weapon

302
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
for me right even if I had the weapon
 

303
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,550
for me right even if I had the weapon
over here every time I go to hit him he

304
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
over here every time I go to hit him he
 

305
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,550
over here every time I go to hit him he
can defend that really really easily so

306
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
can defend that really really easily so
 

307
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,469
can defend that really really easily so
I want to have the weapon always at his

308
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
I want to have the weapon always at his
 

309
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,590
I want to have the weapon always at his
backside now I do risk my backside for

310
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
backside now I do risk my backside for
 

311
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,950
backside now I do risk my backside for
that Advantage but it's a good trade

312
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:29,960
that Advantage but it's a good trade
 

313
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,230
that Advantage but it's a good trade
because my weapon's going to be more

314
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
because my weapon's going to be more
 

315
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,189
because my weapon's going to be more
successful and I'm also always moving

316
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
successful and I'm also always moving
 

317
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,830
successful and I'm also always moving
forward which is an important thing to

318
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:34,840
forward which is an important thing to
 

319
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,790
forward which is an important thing to
understand so when we're here like this

320
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
understand so when we're here like this
 

321
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,110
understand so when we're here like this
as I go to get Josh I'm moving forward

322
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
as I go to get Josh I'm moving forward
 

323
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,350
as I go to get Josh I'm moving forward
into Josh if I'm in this position when I

324
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360
into Josh if I'm in this position when I
 

325
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,270
into Josh if I'm in this position when I
go to move forward into Josh it's no

326
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,280
go to move forward into Josh it's no
 

327
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,230
go to move forward into Josh it's no
good because he's right there with me

328
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
good because he's right there with me
 

329
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,189
good because he's right there with me
right now if I have to get away from

330
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,199
right now if I have to get away from
 

331
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,790
right now if I have to get away from
Josh I have to move backwards right so

332
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
Josh I have to move backwards right so
 

333
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,469
Josh I have to move backwards right so
look if Josh is threatening my weapon I

334
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
look if Josh is threatening my weapon I
 

335
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,990
look if Josh is threatening my weapon I
pull it away I'm moving backwards which

336
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
pull it away I'm moving backwards which
 

337
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,950
pull it away I'm moving backwards which
means Josh in the dominant position that

338
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:55,960
means Josh in the dominant position that
 

339
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,189
means Josh in the dominant position that
is not the case here as Josh comes to

340
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:58,199
is not the case here as Josh comes to
 

341
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,029
is not the case here as Josh comes to
get me I'm getting away from from Josh

342
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:00,039
get me I'm getting away from from Josh
 

343
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,870
get me I'm getting away from from Josh
forward right so always a better trade

344
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:01,880
forward right so always a better trade
 

345
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,749
forward right so always a better trade
for me so I would always prefer to be in

346
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
for me so I would always prefer to be in
 

347
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,150
for me so I would always prefer to be in
that ihon me position and ihon me can be

348
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
that ihon me position and ihon me can be
 

349
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,830
that ihon me position and ihon me can be
sneaky if we let's make a nice one so

350
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
sneaky if we let's make a nice one so
 

351
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,870
sneaky if we let's make a nice one so
they can see so here's a nice ihon right

352
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:09,880
they can see so here's a nice ihon right
 

353
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,070
they can see so here's a nice ihon right
but if we're both standing kind of

354
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,080
but if we're both standing kind of
 

355
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,070
but if we're both standing kind of
squarish you might not recognize this is

356
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
squarish you might not recognize this is
 

357
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,029
squarish you might not recognize this is
ihon me but this is the preferable

358
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
ihon me but this is the preferable
 

359
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,189
ihon me but this is the preferable
position to be in over this position

360
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
position to be in over this position

do is keep space in between you're going
 

367
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,830
do is keep space in between you're going
to put something in there that can be

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
to put something in there that can be
 

369
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,790
to put something in there that can be
done either by your elbow sneaking in

push them away when you do it though you
 

375
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,510
push them away when you do it though you
always need to be the side so that

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
always need to be the side so that
 

377
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,029

384
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
don't want to be hitting into traffic
 

385
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,670
don't want to be hitting into traffic
traffic is the term I use for meaning

386
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680
traffic is the term I use for meaning
 

387
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,510
traffic is the term I use for meaning
there's something there to stop me I

388

there's something there to stop me I
 

389
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,870
there's something there to stop me I
want to be hitting where there's no

390

391
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,830
want to be hitting where there's no
traffic in into his backside so that's

392
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
traffic in into his backside so that's
 

393
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,390
traffic in into his backside so that's
always what I'm looking for when I'm

394
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:49,400
always what I'm looking for when I'm
 

395
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,230
always what I'm looking for when I'm
lining this stuff up all right so this

396
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
lining this stuff up all right so this
 

397
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,110
lining this stuff up all right so this
is a it's a weird kind of Hodge pody of

398
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
is a it's a weird kind of Hodge pody of
 

399
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,749
is a it's a weird kind of Hodge pody of
things but it's something that we've

400
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:54,759
things but it's something that we've
 

401
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,270
things but it's something that we've
done for years a lot of things that Josh

402
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
done for years a lot of things that Josh
 

403
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,350
done for years a lot of things that Josh
and I do naturally in our rondor because

404
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
and I do naturally in our rondor because
 

405
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,710
and I do naturally in our rondor because
we spent lots of years in the garage

406
00:06:59,710 --> 00:06:59,720
we spent lots of years in the garage
 

407
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,350
we spent lots of years in the garage
smashing each other around that I have

408
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
smashing each other around that I have
 

409
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,510
smashing each other around that I have
to convey to people who haven't spent

410
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
to convey to people who haven't spent
 

411
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,350
to convey to people who haven't spent
that time and it's like boy I we just

412
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
that time and it's like boy I we just
 

413
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,909
that time and it's like boy I we just
kind of figured out how to do that you

414
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:06,919
kind of figured out how to do that you
 

415
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,350
kind of figured out how to do that you
know and so I don't know what to tell

416
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,360
know and so I don't know what to tell
 

417
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,270
know and so I don't know what to tell
you to call that that thing but so I've

418
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
you to call that that thing but so I've
 

419
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,950
you to call that that thing but so I've
been lately really trying to figure out

420
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:11,960
been lately really trying to figure out
 

421
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,670
been lately really trying to figure out
how you strip those things out better

422
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
how you strip those things out better
 

423
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,150
how you strip those things out better
and talk about them clearly instead of

424
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,160
and talk about them clearly instead of
 

425
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,550
and talk about them clearly instead of
just having your students do a ton of

426
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
just having your students do a ton of
 

427
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,670
just having your students do a ton of
rondor which I think is a good idea but

428
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:18,680
rondor which I think is a good idea but
 

429
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,189
rondor which I think is a good idea but
that's not always convenient not always

430
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:20,199
that's not always convenient not always
 

431
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,909
that's not always convenient not always
the best way to get into it so that's a

432
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
the best way to get into it so that's a
 

433
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,469
the best way to get into it so that's a
little bit on this what happens if they

434
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
little bit on this what happens if they
 

435
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,909
little bit on this what happens if they
don't check your weapon hand i'm

436
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:24,919
don't check your weapon hand i'm
 

437
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,830
don't check your weapon hand i'm
