00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
I start to engage and I'm gonna come in
 

169
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,990
I start to engage and I'm gonna come in

comes around there's the month you guys

174
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,340
comes around there's the month you guys
 

175
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,909
comes around there's the month you guys
see that so even if you're going slow

176
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
see that so even if you're going slow
 

177
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,070
see that so even if you're going slow
which you guys are I want you to I still

178
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
which you guys are I want you to I still
 

179
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,010
which you guys are I want you to I still
have to penetrate pasta

180
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,020
have to penetrate pasta
 

181
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:52,969
have to penetrate pasta
you guys see that okay let's

182
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:52,979

 

183
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,450

so you're training embryonically

184
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,460
so you're training embryonically
 

185
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,010
so you're training embryonically
embryonically means that you're using

186
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,020
embryonically means that you're using
 

187
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,469
embryonically means that you're using
the Joe

188
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
the Joe
 

189
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,770
the Joe
your partners Joe

190
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,780

 

191
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,710

as kinesthetic vectors

192
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
as kinesthetic vectors
 

193
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,010
as kinesthetic vectors
the timing is not the same as in real

194
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,020
the timing is not the same as in real
 

195
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,930
the timing is not the same as in real
life if you were trying to use the Joe

196
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:14,940
life if you were trying to use the Joe
 

197
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,550
life if you were trying to use the Joe
in the technique okay so for example uh

198
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,560
in the technique okay so for example uh
 

199
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,990
in the technique okay so for example uh
slope he's gonna do the ski

200
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000

 

201
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,230

I can use this line

202
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,240
I can use this line
 

203
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,790
I can use this line
as a kinesthetic Vector to tell me what

204
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800
as a kinesthetic Vector to tell me what
 

205
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,790
as a kinesthetic Vector to tell me what
is the angle of my joke

206
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
is the angle of my joke
 

207
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,170
is the angle of my joke
so if I lift his weapon that this angle

208
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,180
so if I lift his weapon that this angle
 

209
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,210
so if I lift his weapon that this angle
here to the ground that's not the angle

210
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,220
here to the ground that's not the angle
 

211
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,070
here to the ground that's not the angle
of my Joe

212
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
of my Joe
 

213
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,290
of my Joe
that it should be or if I move his

214
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,300
that it should be or if I move his
 

215
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,270
that it should be or if I move his
weapon over

216
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
weapon over
 

217
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,950
weapon over
to my left

218
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
to my left
 

219
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,790
to my left
this is not the placement of my joke

220
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
this is not the placement of my joke
 

221
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,330
this is not the placement of my joke
so if I use his line as a kinesthetic

222
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,340
so if I use his line as a kinesthetic
 

223
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,650
so if I use his line as a kinesthetic
vector

224
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:57,660
vector
 

225
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,670
vector
I have to not move it not lift it and

226
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
I have to not move it not lift it and
 

227
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,790
I have to not move it not lift it and
that'll give me the angle of my kisser

228
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,800

 

229
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:16,070

so you can use it as a training device

230
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080

 

231
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,469

don't move his weapon boom

232
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479

 

233
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:32,450

if you do that

234
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,460

 

235
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,749

you should understand

236
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
you should understand
 

237
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,570
you should understand
how to because you can use it as a

238
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:38,580
how to because you can use it as a
 

239
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,129
how to because you can use it as a
training opportunity

240
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:40,139
training opportunity
 

241
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,830
training opportunity
it's a it's a martial strategy that you

242
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
it's a it's a martial strategy that you
 

243
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,350
it's a it's a martial strategy that you
hit whatever's nearest you especially in

244
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
hit whatever's nearest you especially in
 

245
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,050
hit whatever's nearest you especially in
weapons fighting so

246
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,060
weapons fighting so
 

247
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,930
weapons fighting so
don't be unconscious

248
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:50,940
don't be unconscious
 

249
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,010
don't be unconscious
with your hand placing it okay so as we

250
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,020
with your hand placing it okay so as we
 

251
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,510

embryonically I might get hit
 

263
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,990
embryonically I might get hit
but I want to take advantage and I have

264
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
but I want to take advantage and I have
 

265
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,670
but I want to take advantage and I have
to realize he's trying to defang the

if you walk however
 

275
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,629
if you walk however
you need to know that's an embryonic

276
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
you need to know that's an embryonic
 

277
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,650

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:48,539
the actual uh movement means requires
 

285
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,969
the actual uh movement means requires
that when he would have hit me I hit him

286

okay so maybe you need to slow down more

348
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
okay so maybe you need to slow down more
 

349

maybe even let this go
 

351
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,009
maybe even let this go
and you'll rotate

354
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,000
into position
 

355
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,449
into position
towards that end

356
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:41,459
towards that end
 

357
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,630

foot turn is now on its angle that I
 

415
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,650
foot turn is now on its angle that I
need

416

doesn't want to lift it doesn't want to

482
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
doesn't want to lift it doesn't want to
 

483
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,210
doesn't want to lift it doesn't want to
go around but it also doesn't want that

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
go around but it also doesn't want that
 

485
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,090
go around but it also doesn't want that
weak angle

486
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,100

 

487
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,269

so I don't go weak here

488
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
so I don't go weak here
 

489
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,050
so I don't go weak here
and then around my head

490
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,060

 

491
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,449

I have that angle

492
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:23,459
I have that angle
 

493
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,509
I have that angle
it comes up just like Showman

494
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,519
it comes up just like Showman
 

495
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,790
it comes up just like Showman
and then my wrist will turn it's going

496
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
and then my wrist will turn it's going
 

497
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,090
and then my wrist will turn it's going
to come down my wrist turn boom is where

498
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,100
to come down my wrist turn boom is where
 

499
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,889
to come down my wrist turn boom is where
it is

500
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:33,899
it is
 

501
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,230
it is
so I don't go around my head

502
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,240

 

503
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,810

it just goes here

504
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:41,820
it just goes here
 

505
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,690
it just goes here
crap

506
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:44,700

 

507
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,910

so my angle

508
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:46,920
so my angle
 

509
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,790
so my angle
is going to go down if I didn't turn my

510
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:49,800
is going to go down if I didn't turn my
 

511
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,550
is going to go down if I didn't turn my

do you understand
 

597
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,210
do you understand
so when I go skiing I go it's over

598
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,220
so when I go skiing I go it's over
 

599
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,470
so when I go skiing I go it's over
here

600
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
here
 

601
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,329
here
it's up the circle

602
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:14,339
it's up the circle
 

603
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,150
it's up the circle
do you understand it's not back out

604
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
do you understand it's not back out
 

605
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,009
do you understand it's not back out
there's no way you're going back out

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:21,540
it's impossible
 

609
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,930
it's impossible
so when you feel his weapon come around

610
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:23,940
so when you feel his weapon come around
 

611
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,030
so when you feel his weapon come around
you got to get over here

612
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
you got to get over here
 

613
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,769
you got to get over here
you got to move up the circle to the

614
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:27,779
you got to move up the circle to the
 

615
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,009
you got to move up the circle to the
zone to sanctuary

616
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,019

 

617
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,590

so uh

618
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
so uh
 

619
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,810
so uh
let's mark it so you can understand it

620
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:35,820
let's mark it so you can understand it
 

621
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,389
let's mark it so you can understand it
okay stay there

622
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
okay stay there
 

623
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,509
okay stay there
so there's my degree of penetration

624
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
so there's my degree of penetration
 

625
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,509
so there's my degree of penetration
okay and will Mark let us move a little

626
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:44,519
okay and will Mark let us move a little
 

627
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,790
okay and will Mark let us move a little
forward so that my back foot is on this

628
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
forward so that my back foot is on this
 

629
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,569
forward so that my back foot is on this
line

630
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:47,579
line
 

631
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,610
line
okay

632
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,620
okay
 

633

and move
 

641
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,110
and move
fewer of that and I'll never get there

642
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
fewer of that and I'll never get there
 

643

tiny so for example or the mine so

648
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
tiny so for example or the mine so
 

649
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,289
tiny so for example or the mine so
you're under penetrated

650
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:15,299
you're under penetrated
 

651
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,750
you're under penetrated
you get it okay then he was never going

652
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
you get it okay then he was never going
 

653
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,230
you get it okay then he was never going
to hit me anyways okay or

let me go back a little bit because it's

712
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:40,679
let me go back a little bit because it's
 

713
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,130
let me go back a little bit because it's
gonna come up as as I'm gonna change the

gonna come up as as I'm gonna change the
 

715
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,810
gonna come up as as I'm gonna change the
form from what Sensei did and I'll

716
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:44,820
form from what Sensei did and I'll
 

717
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,190
form from what Sensei did and I'll
explain why okay

718
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,200
explain why okay
 

719
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,830
explain why okay
so when I first learned the form from

720
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:48,840
so when I first learned the form from
 

721
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,630
so when I first learned the form from
Sensei it had a front crossover

722
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
Sensei it had a front crossover
 

723
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,190
Sensei it had a front crossover

727
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,549

and I always up here

728
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559

 

729
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,190

and then later can't you say he started

730
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
and then later can't you say he started
 

731
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,190
and then later can't you say he started
changing it because you had to start

732
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
changing it because you had to start
 

733
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,529
changing it because you had to start
doing this for the person that actually

734
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:12,539
doing this for the person that actually
 

735
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,090
doing this for the person that actually
penetrated

done the front crossover
 

757
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,890
done the front crossover
okay

758
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:45,900

 

759
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,350

um and when you look at the whole of the

760
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,360
um and when you look at the whole of the
 

761
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,190
um and when you look at the whole of the
form

762
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
form
 

763
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,730
form
the whole of the form is really about

764
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:52,740
the whole of the form is really about
 

765
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,650
the whole of the form is really about
ushito tenkon

766
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:54,660
ushito tenkon
 

767
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,289
ushito tenkon
which comes up a lot in those other

768
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:57,299
which comes up a lot in those other
 

769
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,930
which comes up a lot in those other
environments you do oh shoot a tank on a

770
00:19:59,930 --> 00:19:59,940
environments you do oh shoot a tank on a
 

771
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,289
environments you do oh shoot a tank on a
lot so if you look at uh Gateway

772
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:03,299
lot so if you look at uh Gateway
 

773
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,230
lot so if you look at uh Gateway
Aikido video number 15 where we're

774
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
Aikido video number 15 where we're
 

775
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,529
Aikido video number 15 where we're
looking at giwasa more live environments

776
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:09,539
looking at giwasa more live environments
 

777
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,370
looking at giwasa more live environments
it's constantly ushito tenkan constantly

778
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,380
it's constantly ushito tenkan constantly
 

779
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,070
it's constantly ushito tenkan constantly
okay because that's how you deal with

780
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
okay because that's how you deal with
 

781
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,690
okay because that's how you deal with
aggression with Shield tank on okay so

782
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:19,700
aggression with Shield tank on okay so
 

783
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,570
aggression with Shield tank on okay so
as I'm doing as I'm doing this form

784
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:22,580
as I'm doing as I'm doing this form
 

785
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,070
as I'm doing as I'm doing this form
that's why I go to this technique okay

786
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
that's why I go to this technique okay
 

787
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,110
that's why I go to this technique okay
so if you look at it

788
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,120
so if you look at it
 

789
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,789
so if you look at it
in terms of angle deviation okay he has

790
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
in terms of angle deviation okay he has
 

791
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,090
in terms of angle deviation okay he has
uh just Soldier Joe out of the way

792
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,100
uh just Soldier Joe out of the way
 

793
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,970
uh just Soldier Joe out of the way
this is representing the thrust of my

794
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:40,980
this is representing the thrust of my
 

795
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,789
this is representing the thrust of my
ski that Force okay so it don't move

796
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:43,799
ski that Force okay so it don't move
 

797
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,390
ski that Force okay so it don't move
your body it's pushing straight from my

798
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,400
your body it's pushing straight from my
 

799
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,529
your body it's pushing straight from my
12 to his six Okay so

800
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:51,539
12 to his six Okay so
 

801
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,010
12 to his six Okay so
he's going to go around that Force

802
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,020
he's going to go around that Force
 

803
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,169
he's going to go around that Force
and that's what makes it the deviation

804
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:57,179
and that's what makes it the deviation
 

805
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,690
and that's what makes it the deviation
you see

806
00:20:59,690 --> 00:20:59,700
you see
 

807
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,570
you see
put that in your other hand

808
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:02,580
put that in your other hand
 

809
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,450
put that in your other hand
his chest size here

810
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:05,460
his chest size here
 

811
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,650
his chest size here
you see okay and its energy is going

812
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:09,660
you see okay and its energy is going
 

813
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,890
you see okay and its energy is going
that way so make a Fists

814
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:12,900
that way so make a Fists
 

815
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,789
that way so make a Fists
and that force is here

816
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
and that force is here
 

817
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,830
and that force is here
so you're going to see what I'm going to

818
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:18,840
so you're going to see what I'm going to
 

819
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,770
so you're going to see what I'm going to
do is not try to come back out

820
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
do is not try to come back out
 

821
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,070
do is not try to come back out
I'm going to blend in with that Force

822
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm going to blend in with that Force
 

823
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,650
I'm going to blend in with that Force
and eventually just because the way a

824
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:27,660
and eventually just because the way a
 

825
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,169
and eventually just because the way a
circle inside of the square works I'm

826
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:30,179
circle inside of the square works I'm
 

827
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,690
circle inside of the square works I'm
going to be out of range of that Force

828
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:32,700
going to be out of range of that Force
 

829
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,210
going to be out of range of that Force
you see that

830
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,220
you see that
 

831
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,750
you see that
so that's what I'm trying to do

832
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
so that's what I'm trying to do
 

833
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,630
so that's what I'm trying to do
as we go we go a little slower

834
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640
as we go we go a little slower
 

835
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,730
as we go we go a little slower
I'm going to do the same over

836
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm going to do the same over
 

837
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,430
I'm going to do the same over
penetration so Mark where his spine is

838
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,440
penetration so Mark where his spine is
 

839
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,950
penetration so Mark where his spine is
in space I'm going to do the same spinal

840
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
in space I'm going to do the same spinal
 

841
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,409
in space I'm going to do the same spinal
displacement of an actual assaultive

842
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:51,419
displacement of an actual assaultive
 

843
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,510
displacement of an actual assaultive
attack you're going to see that it goes

844
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
attack you're going to see that it goes
 

845
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,190
attack you're going to see that it goes
way past that

846
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
way past that
 

847
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,870
way past that
and then

848
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
and then
 

849
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,230
and then
I am going to now take what I learned in

850
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
I am going to now take what I learned in
 

851
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,830
I am going to now take what I learned in
those Force factors and see where they

852
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
those Force factors and see where they
 

853
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,130
those Force factors and see where they
apply when his hips change directions

854
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,140
apply when his hips change directions
 

855
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,070
apply when his hips change directions
okay so in other words you're going to

856
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
okay so in other words you're going to
 

857
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,990
okay so in other words you're going to
look for a spinal displacement but

858
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
look for a spinal displacement but
 

859
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,970
look for a spinal displacement but
you're going to watch his hips change

860
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:13,980
you're going to watch his hips change
 

861
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,370
you're going to watch his hips change
the vector you're going to see that my

862
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:16,380
the vector you're going to see that my
 

863
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,730
the vector you're going to see that my
hips stay connected to his hips that way

864
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:19,740
hips stay connected to his hips that way
 

865
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,490
hips stay connected to his hips that way
I'll neutralize those Force vectors okay

866
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:22,500
I'll neutralize those Force vectors okay
 

867
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,850
I'll neutralize those Force vectors okay
so you're going to watch all that boom

868
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:25,860
so you're going to watch all that boom
 

869
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,710
so you're going to watch all that boom
I'm going this way

870
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm going this way
 

871
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,169
I'm going this way
if we take away the joke

872
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:30,179
if we take away the joke
 

873
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:36,230
if we take away the joke
you'll watch his hips boom

874
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240

 

875
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,950

boom

876
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:39,960

 

877
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,850

so if you watch my back foot now

878
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:43,860
so if you watch my back foot now
 

879
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,810
so if you watch my back foot now
it's not going there that's too late he

880
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:47,820
it's not going there that's too late he
 

881
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,090
it's not going there that's too late he
already changed the vector I'm too late

882
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,100
already changed the vector I'm too late
 

883
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,130
already changed the vector I'm too late
that would be

884
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,140
that would be
 

885
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,710
that would be
like in any fight I'm staying still and

886
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
like in any fight I'm staying still and
 

887
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,570
like in any fight I'm staying still and
he already moved I'm not moving at his

888
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,580
he already moved I'm not moving at his
 

889
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,570
he already moved I'm not moving at his
intention so watch my back foot now it's

890
00:22:59,570 --> 00:22:59,580
intention so watch my back foot now it's
 

891
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,610
intention so watch my back foot now it's
not doing what you thought it was doing

892
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:01,620
not doing what you thought it was doing
 

893
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,850
not doing what you thought it was doing
as I come in

894
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:04,860
as I come in
 

895
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,029
as I come in
I relate my back foot and my hips to his

896
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:08,039
I relate my back foot and my hips to his
 

897
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,850
I relate my back foot and my hips to his
hips

898
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:13,860

 

899
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,330

if he didn't move

900
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:17,340

 

901
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,970

it still would work but if he didn't

902
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:19,980
it still would work but if he didn't
 

903
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,029
it still would work but if he didn't
move his hands there'd be no point for

904
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
move his hands there'd be no point for
 

905
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,610
move his hands there'd be no point for
me to have to move when he moved you see

906
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:25,620
me to have to move when he moved you see
 

907
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,370
me to have to move when he moved you see
that so I keep that back foot there it's

908
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,380
that so I keep that back foot there it's
 

909
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,710
that so I keep that back foot there it's
no different

910
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
no different
 

911
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,529
no different
if we're here and I'm going to throw my

912
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:33,539
if we're here and I'm going to throw my
 

913
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,810
if we're here and I'm going to throw my
punch and I see his deviation deviating

914
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:35,820
punch and I see his deviation deviating
 

915
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,669
punch and I see his deviation deviating
some way you see

916
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
some way you see
 

917
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,890
some way you see
I'm not gonna throw that punch over here

918
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:39,900
I'm not gonna throw that punch over here
 

919
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,430
I'm not gonna throw that punch over here
because now I'm looking the wrong way so

920
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
because now I'm looking the wrong way so
 

921
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,909
because now I'm looking the wrong way so
once I see his hips move I have to move

922
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:46,919
once I see his hips move I have to move
 

923
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,250
once I see his hips move I have to move
my hips with his hips so I'm not looking

924
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,260
my hips with his hips so I'm not looking
 

925
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,289
my hips with his hips so I'm not looking
the wrong way okay

926
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:51,299
the wrong way okay
 

927
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,149
the wrong way okay
going back to video 15 I have to move at

928
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
going back to video 15 I have to move at
 

929
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,490
going back to video 15 I have to move at
the level of intention I can't wait for

930
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:58,500
the level of intention I can't wait for
 

931
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,430
the level of intention I can't wait for
these things to Over Manifest okay so

932
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
these things to Over Manifest okay so
 

933
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,690
these things to Over Manifest okay so
let's try it again

934
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:05,700

 

935
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,090

says this this is something when I train

936
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,100
says this this is something when I train
 

937
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,970
says this this is something when I train
with uh under Mr Parker

938
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:10,980
with uh under Mr Parker
 

939
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,510
with uh under Mr Parker
so the founder of the American tempo

940
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:14,520
so the founder of the American tempo
 

941
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,190
so the founder of the American tempo
so

942
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,200
so
 

943
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,850
so
he's looking at historical

944
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:18,860
he's looking at historical
 

945
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,490
he's looking at historical
uh Chinese forms and he's trying to give

946
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:22,500
uh Chinese forms and he's trying to give
 

947
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,970
uh Chinese forms and he's trying to give
it some sort of scientific

948
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:25,980
it some sort of scientific
 

949
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,590
it some sort of scientific
um conceptual breakdown okay so he came

950
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
um conceptual breakdown okay so he came
 

951
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,930
um conceptual breakdown okay so he came
with up with this concept called zones

952
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:32,940
with up with this concept called zones
 

953
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,950
with up with this concept called zones
of sanctuary

954
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:39,960

 

955
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,070

and to help people understand it

956
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,080
and to help people understand it
 

957
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,690
and to help people understand it
he said

958
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:44,700
he said
 

959
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,590
he said
if you take a circle

960
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:48,600

 

961
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:58,970

and you draw a square around that Circle

962
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:58,980

 

963
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,510

and you shade in the circle

964
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,520
and you shade in the circle
 

965
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,490
and you shade in the circle
there's going to be areas of the square

966
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:04,500
there's going to be areas of the square
 

967
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,649
there's going to be areas of the square
that are not shaded in

968
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:06,659
that are not shaded in
 

969
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:13,070
that are not shaded in
okay so if you take your clock principle

970
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,080

 

971
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,909

they're at the angles do you see

972
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:16,919

 

973
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,690

so to speak

974
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:20,700

 

975
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,409

okay if you look at your Aikido uh

976
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:24,419
okay if you look at your Aikido uh
 

977
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,630
okay if you look at your Aikido uh
spiraling footwork that we've been going

978
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
spiraling footwork that we've been going
 

979
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,890
spiraling footwork that we've been going
over

980
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:27,900
over
 

981
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,649
over
you move into those corners

982
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:30,659
you move into those corners
 

983
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,250
you move into those corners
don't go on the 12 to 6 or the nine to

984
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,260
don't go on the 12 to 6 or the nine to
 

985
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,870
don't go on the 12 to 6 or the nine to
six line or you are in a shaded part of

986
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
six line or you are in a shaded part of
 

987
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,950
six line or you are in a shaded part of
the circle

988
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:39,960
the circle
 

989
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,130
the circle
the Shaded part of the circle represents

990
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,140
the Shaded part of the circle represents
 

991
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,850
the Shaded part of the circle represents
in the middle is the person's spine

992
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:46,860
in the middle is the person's spine
 

993
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,430
in the middle is the person's spine
and these are their limbs

994
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
and these are their limbs
 

995
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,230
and these are their limbs
all the angles that their limbs can hit

996
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,240

 

997
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,789

got it

998
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
got it
 

999
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,289
got it
okay

1000
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:03,299

 

1001
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,409

so for example if you throw a strike to

1002
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:06,419
so for example if you throw a strike to
 

1003
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,909
so for example if you throw a strike to
my face boom

1004
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
my face boom
 

1005
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,570
my face boom
here I am at six o'clock I am in the

1006
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:11,580
here I am at six o'clock I am in the
 

1007
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,850
here I am at six o'clock I am in the
Shaded part of the circle

1008
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:13,860
Shaded part of the circle
 

1009
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,669
Shaded part of the circle
and if I start moving

1010
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:16,679
and if I start moving
 

1011
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,370
and if I start moving
uh up the circle and in he will stay

1012
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:22,380
uh up the circle and in he will stay
 

1013
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,890
uh up the circle and in he will stay
you see how I'm pushing into it you see

1014
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:24,900
you see how I'm pushing into it you see
 

1015
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,909
you see how I'm pushing into it you see
he's gonna hit me but if I stay on the

1016
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:28,919
he's gonna hit me but if I stay on the
 

1017
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,970
he's gonna hit me but if I stay on the
circumference of the circle and I move

1018
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:31,980
circumference of the circle and I move
 

1019
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,570
circumference of the circle and I move
to that unshaded part of the square

1020
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:34,580
to that unshaded part of the square
 

1021
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,850
to that unshaded part of the square
you'll see that I come off of it

1022
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:37,860
you'll see that I come off of it
 

1023
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,730
you'll see that I come off of it
you see okay

1024
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:40,740
you see okay
 

1025
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,070
you see okay
so that it doesn't change if he has is

1026
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,080
so that it doesn't change if he has is
 

1027
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,510
so that it doesn't change if he has is
Joe

1028
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520

 

1029
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,130

there it is

1030
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,140
there it is
 

1031
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,490
there it is
I'm going to move off of it

1032
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm going to move off of it
 

1033
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,630
I'm going to move off of it
and you'll be out of it okay

1034
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640

 

1035
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,690

I don't need the extra range of having

1036
00:26:59,690 --> 00:26:59,700
I don't need the extra range of having
 

1037
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,610
I don't need the extra range of having
to come back out

1038
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:01,620
to come back out
 

1039
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,250
to come back out
that's going to take time and require

1040
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,260
that's going to take time and require
 

1041
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,710
that's going to take time and require
space and in this case I don't have

1042
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
space and in this case I don't have
 

1043
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,409
space and in this case I don't have
either one I don't have time okay so

1044
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:09,419
either one I don't have time okay so
 

1045
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,810
either one I don't have time okay so
what I do instead is I'm going to uh

1046
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:14,820
what I do instead is I'm going to uh
 

1047
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,130
what I do instead is I'm going to uh
move up the circle

1048
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,140

 

1049
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,190

so I hit that zone of sanctuary

1050
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,200
so I hit that zone of sanctuary
 

1051
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,409
so I hit that zone of sanctuary
then I'm where I want to be

1052
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:24,419
then I'm where I want to be
 

1053
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,110
then I'm where I want to be
okay I don't want to be way out of it

1054
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
okay I don't want to be way out of it
 

1055
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,090
okay I don't want to be way out of it
because you're not going to be able to

1056
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,100
because you're not going to be able to
 

1057
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,590
because you're not going to be able to
do Mafia tush

1058
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,600
do Mafia tush
 

1059
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,810
do Mafia tush
you're gonna you'll do some Joe weird

1060
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:32,820
you're gonna you'll do some Joe weird
 

1061
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,690
you're gonna you'll do some Joe weird
Joe fake stuff that you won't be Mafia

1062
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:35,700
Joe fake stuff that you won't be Mafia
 

1063
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,870
Joe fake stuff that you won't be Mafia
toast for the attacks and sounds okay so

1064
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
toast for the attacks and sounds okay so
 

1065
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,810
toast for the attacks and sounds okay so
make sure that that's your concept here

1066
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:41,820
make sure that that's your concept here
 

1067
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,370
make sure that that's your concept here
I'll see okay I see and I go here

1068
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:46,380
I'll see okay I see and I go here
 

1069
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,370
I'll see okay I see and I go here
this is where I go again if you're just

1070
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:49,380
this is where I go again if you're just
 

1071
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,029
this is where I go again if you're just
tracking the hits that's where you go if

1072
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
tracking the hits that's where you go if
 

1073
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,669
tracking the hits that's where you go if
you ski and you come back here our hips

1074
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
you ski and you come back here our hips
 

1075
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,769
you ski and you come back here our hips
are not looking at each other you see

1076
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:57,779
are not looking at each other you see
 

1077
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,850
are not looking at each other you see
that

1078
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:58,860
that
 

1079
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,090
that
they're not matching rotation I scan my

1080
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,100
they're not matching rotation I scan my
 

1081
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,070
they're not matching rotation I scan my
hips rotate with his hips you're going

1082
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
hips rotate with his hips you're going
 

1083
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,250
hips rotate with his hips you're going
to be in that zone sanctuary okay try it

1084
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,260
to be in that zone sanctuary okay try it
 

1085
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,310
to be in that zone sanctuary okay try it
again

1086
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320

 

1087
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,830

okay so now we're in machia touch and

1088
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:12,840
okay so now we're in machia touch and
 

1089
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,169
okay so now we're in machia touch and
you can train Market plus embryonically

1090
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:15,179
you can train Market plus embryonically
 

1091
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,289
you can train Market plus embryonically
again that is what I'm going to use his

1092
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:18,299
again that is what I'm going to use his
 

1093
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,950
again that is what I'm going to use his
Joe is a kinesthetic Vector to learn the

Joe is a kinesthetic Vector to learn the
 

1095
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,549
Joe is a kinesthetic Vector to learn the
angles I need on my weapon okay and I

1096
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:25,559
angles I need on my weapon okay and I
 

1097
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,510
angles I need on my weapon okay and I
always don't move his Joe his Joe is

1098
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
always don't move his Joe his Joe is
 

1099
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,210
always don't move his Joe his Joe is
what I go around okay it's representing

1100
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,220
what I go around okay it's representing
 

1101
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,090
what I go around okay it's representing
young energy it's representing my angles

1102
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,100
young energy it's representing my angles
 

1103
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,909
young energy it's representing my angles
of deviation and my angles of deflection

1104
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
of deviation and my angles of deflection
 

1105
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,830
of deviation and my angles of deflection
as a as a orientation okay so I'll ski

1106
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
as a as a orientation okay so I'll ski
 

1107
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,230
as a as a orientation okay so I'll ski
you'll see I'm moving up here all right

1108
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,240
you'll see I'm moving up here all right
 

1109
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,610
you'll see I'm moving up here all right
he's now going to make it uh that Vector

1110
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:49,620
he's now going to make it uh that Vector
 

1111
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,789
he's now going to make it uh that Vector
he's not it's not kesaruchi anymore

1112
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
he's not it's not kesaruchi anymore
 

1113
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,110
he's not it's not kesaruchi anymore
I come up I don't move I don't lift it I

1114
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
I come up I don't move I don't lift it I
 

1115
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,310
I come up I don't move I don't lift it I
don't move it

1116
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
don't move it
 

1117
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,890
don't move it
it's just a training vector

1118
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:00,900
it's just a training vector
 

1119
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,590
it's just a training vector
so from here I'm gonna go around it

1120
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
so from here I'm gonna go around it
 

1121
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,470
so from here I'm gonna go around it
without moving it and without separating

1122
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
without moving it and without separating
 

1123
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,890
without moving it and without separating
I go around it and down it

1124
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:09,900
I go around it and down it
 

1125
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,769
I go around it and down it
then I gotta make sure that I bathe the

1126
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:12,779
then I gotta make sure that I bathe the
 

1127
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,250
then I gotta make sure that I bathe the
my again because his next move is harai

1128
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,260
my again because his next move is harai
 

1129
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,250
my again because his next move is harai
he's gonna do a Shiro ten Twan so I

1130
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,260
he's gonna do a Shiro ten Twan so I
 

1131
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,370
he's gonna do a Shiro ten Twan so I
reverse engineered the my and you'll see

1132
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,380
reverse engineered the my and you'll see
 

1133
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,710
reverse engineered the my and you'll see
stay there you'll see that I have the

1134
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
stay there you'll see that I have the
 

1135
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,269
stay there you'll see that I have the
same degree of penetration so he does

1136
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
same degree of penetration so he does
 

1137
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,149
same degree of penetration so he does
and you'll see I'll use that same shield

1138
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
and you'll see I'll use that same shield
 

1139
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,850
and you'll see I'll use that same shield
in my hand which is his attack in this

1140
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:34,860
in my hand which is his attack in this
 

1141
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,970
in my hand which is his attack in this
case okay it's not up to him to miss my

1142
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:37,980
case okay it's not up to him to miss my
 

1143
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,549
case okay it's not up to him to miss my
hand because that'll jack up his

1144
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
hand because that'll jack up his
 

1145
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,710
hand because that'll jack up his
orientation you see how open he is on

1146
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
orientation you see how open he is on
 

1147
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,330
orientation you see how open he is on
this side you know he hits my hand okay

1148
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,340
this side you know he hits my hand okay
 

1149
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,570
this side you know he hits my hand okay
so if I want to do machiotosh

1150
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:49,580
so if I want to do machiotosh
 

1151
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,130
so if I want to do machiotosh
embryonically you'll see the form kind

1152
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,140
embryonically you'll see the form kind
 

1153
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,330
embryonically you'll see the form kind
of stops

1154
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:53,340
of stops
 

1155
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,610
of stops
and I go around

1156
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:55,620
and I go around
 

1157
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,190
and I go around
and we'll end it here with that degree

1158
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,200
and we'll end it here with that degree
 

1159
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,570
and we'll end it here with that degree
of penetration

1160
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:02,580

 

1161
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,669

what you want to understand again when

1162
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:04,679
what you want to understand again when
 

1163
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,830
what you want to understand again when
you train embryonically

1164
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
you train embryonically
 

1165
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,590
you train embryonically
