00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,350

okay so this uh

00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
okay so this uh
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,990
okay so this uh
is gonna be like quarter speed okay and

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
is gonna be like quarter speed okay and
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,389
is gonna be like quarter speed okay and
he's

00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
he's

is space time of course
 

17
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,910
is space time of course
and of course space time relative to a

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
and of course space time relative to a

uh because he's cooperating you'll find
 

45
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,229
uh because he's cooperating you'll find
you do that against a

you do that against a

49
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,389

will not be there they will overpower

00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
will not be there they will overpower

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:52,950
will not be there they will overpower
you

52
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960

53
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,990

okay so as as he's going i have to keep

54
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
okay so as as he's going i have to keep
 

55
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,590
okay so as as he's going i have to keep
the mind you have to

56
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600

 

57
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:24,469

and this is too fast what i want

58
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479

 

59
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,469

so a little slower still keep coming up

60
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
so a little slower still keep coming up
 

61
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,710
so a little slower still keep coming up
so here what i'm doing is making him go

62
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
so here what i'm doing is making him go
 

63
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,069
so here what i'm doing is making him go
around me

64
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079

 

65
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,109

this is one way to say i'm close if i

66
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
this is one way to say i'm close if i
 

67
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,670
this is one way to say i'm close if i
stay on this line he's going to close

68
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
stay on this line he's going to close
 

69
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,390
stay on this line he's going to close

the gap
 

71
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,870
the gap
but by making him go around me i can

72
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
but by making him go around me i can
 

73
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,950
but by making him go around me i can
have his motion continue without

74
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
have his motion continue without
 

75
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,230
have his motion continue without
actually closing

76
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
actually closing
 

77
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,270
actually closing
so look for that i keep stepping around

78
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
so look for that i keep stepping around
 

79
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,870
so look for that i keep stepping around
on the spiral

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880

this will not be good it's closing

this will not be good it's closing

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,670
this will not be good it's closing
little by little each time

watch for your uchi's because they will

watch for your uchi's because they will
 

87
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,430
watch for your uchi's because they will
help you when he gets too close

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,460

you can do stripes too

97
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,710

meaning i can't go out of this

so we go and one of them is body reading

142
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
so we go and one of them is body reading
 

143

so we go and one of them is body reading
so i'll you don't stop no matter what i

144
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
so i'll you don't stop no matter what i

so this is a kick obviously

148

so this is a kick obviously
 

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,830
so this is a kick obviously
but you can see it and you see how i

150
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
but you can see it and you see how i
 

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,830
but you can see it and you see how i
moved out of kicking range and not out

152
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
moved out of kicking range and not out
 

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,150
moved out of kicking range and not out
of hand range

154

of hand range
 

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,710

so same thing his body moves towards me

156
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
so same thing his body moves towards me
 

157
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,070
so same thing his body moves towards me
but i go hand raised and

158

159
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,790

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
i have to be able to read it so some of
 

161
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,670
i have to be able to read it so some of
the signs

162
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
the signs
 

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,029

that front foot that little step you

164
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039

right he goes and the head right right

that front foot he's measuring
 

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,350
that front foot he's measuring
do you see so when you when you measure

178
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
do you see so when you when you measure
 

179

measures
you see and i do that that time that

238
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
you see and i do that that time that
 

239

you see and i do that that time that
would not be okay

240
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
would not be okay
 

241
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,150
would not be okay
because i'd be moving into that hand but

242
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
because i'd be moving into that hand but
 

243
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,749
because i'd be moving into that hand but

247
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,870
i'm going to be out of range of his
hands because he's working with

look for him to turn tight

356
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880

 

357
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,910

okay so read the body he can't read the

358
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
okay so read the body he can't read the
 

359
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,630
okay so read the body he can't read the
body

360

body
 

361
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,990
body
at least get out of his reticle okay

362
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
at least get out of his reticle okay
 

363
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,190
at least get out of his reticle okay
all right so the first point that was

364
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
all right so the first point that was
 

365
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,870
all right so the first point that was
brought up here

366
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
brought up here
 

367
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,750
brought up here
was uh this he he goes i know

368
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
was uh this he he goes i know
 

369
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,069
was uh this he he goes i know
and now there's no way so if you look at

370
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
and now there's no way so if you look at
 

371
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,269
and now there's no way so if you look at
this

372
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
this
 

373
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,990
this
this is very much akin to when a little

374
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
this is very much akin to when a little
 

375
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,030
this is very much akin to when a little
kid

376
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
kid
 

377
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,150
kid
experiences fear they'll shut their eyes

378
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
experiences fear they'll shut their eyes
 

379
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,310
experiences fear they'll shut their eyes
and then they pretend the fear is not

380
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
and then they pretend the fear is not
 

381
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,150
and then they pretend the fear is not
there or they put the blanket over their

382
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
there or they put the blanket over their
 

383
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,550
there or they put the blanket over their
head

384
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
head
 

385
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,150
head
right it's very very uh ingrained in us

386
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
right it's very very uh ingrained in us
 

387
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,710
right it's very very uh ingrained in us
like

388
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
like
 

389
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,550
like
there's some connection between what we

390
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
there's some connection between what we
 

391
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,069
there's some connection between what we
see and what we feel

392
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
see and what we feel
 

393
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,190
see and what we feel
so you have to watch that because

394
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
so you have to watch that because
 

395
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,670
so you have to watch that because
basically i have disconnected from this

396

and i've lost all awareness and all
 

401
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,790
and i've lost all awareness and all
communion with this person so

402
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
communion with this person so
 

403
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,030
communion with this person so
you want to think of it this way it's

404
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
you want to think of it this way it's
 

405
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,110
you want to think of it this way it's
better to be hit by the strike that you

406
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
better to be hit by the strike that you
 

407
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,550
better to be hit by the strike that you
see hits you than to

408
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
see hits you than to
 

409
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,389
see hits you than to
have the strike you don't see miss you

410
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
have the strike you don't see miss you
 

411
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,470
have the strike you don't see miss you
out of these two especially in training

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,790
out of these two especially in training
this is why we do those sensitivity

414
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
this is why we do those sensitivity
 

415
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,509
this is why we do those sensitivity
drills

this is part if you look when you duck

442
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
this is part if you look when you duck
 

443
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,910
this is part if you look when you duck
it's all nobody ever ducks like this no

444
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
it's all nobody ever ducks like this no
 

445
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,910
it's all nobody ever ducks like this no
one ever ducks wisely

446

one ever ducks wisely
 

447
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,990
one ever ducks wisely
they always duck and then we break the

448
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
they always duck and then we break the
 

449
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,190
they always duck and then we break the
first rule which is

450
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
first rule which is
 

451
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,430
first rule which is
i'm letting the my dog go ahead i'm

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
uh become invalid he got too close
 

457
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,310
uh become invalid he got too close
okay so force yourself

458
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
okay so force yourself
 

459
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,870
okay so force yourself
to look at what's happening so you're

460
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
to look at what's happening so you're
 

461
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,910
to look at what's happening so you're
always moving

462
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
always moving
 

463
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,949
always moving
ha boom

464
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959

 

465
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,990

for me

466
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000

 

467
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,910

second point is

468
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920

 

469
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,430

once i go from this immaterial

470
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
once i go from this immaterial
 

471
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,190
once i go from this immaterial
connection once i do that

472
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
connection once i do that
 

473
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,870
connection once i do that
and i get to the material connection

474
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
and i get to the material connection
 

475
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,150
and i get to the material connection
it's all dependent upon now the my has

476
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
it's all dependent upon now the my has
 

477
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,310
it's all dependent upon now the my has
its third aspect by which it becomes

478
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
its third aspect by which it becomes
 

479
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,350
its third aspect by which it becomes
definable

480
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
definable
 

481
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,110
definable
so if i want to keep connection with

482
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
so if i want to keep connection with
 

483
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,110
so if i want to keep connection with
this hand moving back

484
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
this hand moving back
 

485
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,150
this hand moving back
would be the wrong mind you see if he

486
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
would be the wrong mind you see if he
 

487
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,509
would be the wrong mind you see if he
pulls back

488
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
pulls back
 

489
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,790
pulls back
staying still is the wrong mind so if i

490
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
staying still is the wrong mind so if i
 

491
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,829
staying still is the wrong mind so if i
want that connection

492
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
want that connection
 

493
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,150
want that connection
i have to move with that hand so i can

494
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
i have to move with that hand so i can
 

495
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,470
i have to move with that hand so i can
keep it in its check

496
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
keep it in its check
 

497
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,829
keep it in its check
so your mind is dynamic it's not

498
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
so your mind is dynamic it's not
 

499
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,670
so your mind is dynamic it's not
static third point i want to make

500
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
static third point i want to make
 

501
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,110
static third point i want to make
is you chasing techniques and now

502
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
is you chasing techniques and now
 

503
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,949
is you chasing techniques and now
you're violating the no self doctrine

504
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
you're violating the no self doctrine
 

505
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,430
you're violating the no self doctrine
okay

506
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
okay
 

507
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,509
okay
so you're here and you go double leg

508
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
so you're here and you go double leg
 

509
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,710
so you're here and you go double leg
then no

510
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720

 

511
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,829

right even on the lighter person

512
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
right even on the lighter person
 

513
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,750
right even on the lighter person
you can't do it all the time because

514
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
you can't do it all the time because
 

515
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,910
you can't do it all the time because
it's not fitting it's forcing

516
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
it's not fitting it's forcing
 

517
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,069
it's not fitting it's forcing
so as we as we go you see i'm moving

518
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
so as we as we go you see i'm moving
 

519
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,030
so as we as we go you see i'm moving
already in that spiral geometry with

520
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
already in that spiral geometry with
 

521
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,790
already in that spiral geometry with
that first step so

522
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
that first step so
 

523
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,629
that first step so
he's gonna have to turn this way

524
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
he's gonna have to turn this way
 

525
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,150
he's gonna have to turn this way
or this way to get me i already sought

526
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
or this way to get me i already sought
 

527
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,350
or this way to get me i already sought
a tactile connection so he goes albert

528
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
a tactile connection so he goes albert
 

529
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,629
a tactile connection so he goes albert
we're going this way

530
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
we're going this way
 

531
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,750
we're going this way
you see i found the other hand and

532
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
you see i found the other hand and
 

533
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,389
you see i found the other hand and
it's more what are you going to do what

534
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
it's more what are you going to do what
 

535
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,310
it's more what are you going to do what
do you want to do

536

do you want to do
say he wants to go low so that's my

538
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
say he wants to go low so that's my
 

539
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,590
say he wants to go low so that's my
technique

540
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600

 

541
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,829

come back see if we can get the same

542
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
come back see if we can get the same
 

543
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,189
come back see if we can get the same
thing

544
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
thing
 

545
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,870
thing
so from the weave he goes

546
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
so from the weave he goes
 

547
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,189
so from the weave he goes
whoa it's not that i go down here we go

548
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
whoa it's not that i go down here we go
 

549
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,389
whoa it's not that i go down here we go
i don't do that i let what's happened

550
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
i don't do that i let what's happened
 

551
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,069
i don't do that i let what's happened
happen and what's happening go

552
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
happen and what's happening go
 

553
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,710
happen and what's happening go
is perfectly fine with me so see he's

554
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
is perfectly fine with me so see he's
 

555
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,590
is perfectly fine with me so see he's
turning tighter

556
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
turning tighter
 

557
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,310
turning tighter
he wants this leg over here do you see

558
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
he wants this leg over here do you see
 

559
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,710
he wants this leg over here do you see
so

560
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
so
 

561
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,629
so
instead of fighting the leg he goes

562
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
instead of fighting the leg he goes
 

563
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:28,350
instead of fighting the leg he goes
i move the leg he goes boom

564
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,360

 

565
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,189

non-confession also means that i'm not

566
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
non-confession also means that i'm not
 

567
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,550
non-confession also means that i'm not
forcing the situation i'm letting the

568
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
forcing the situation i'm letting the
 

569
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:42,829
forcing the situation i'm letting the
situation

570
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839

 

571
00:14:42,839 --> 00:15:04,710

unfold

572
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720

never

574
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399

 

575
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,069

see the difference okay chinese

576
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
see the difference okay chinese
 

577
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,430
see the difference okay chinese
the next points brought up is

578
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
the next points brought up is
 

579
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,710
the next points brought up is
uh we're we're gonna go right and

580
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
uh we're we're gonna go right and
 

581
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,550
uh we're we're gonna go right and
i'm trying to trade myself uh

582
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
i'm trying to trade myself uh
 

583
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,350
i'm trying to trade myself uh
this is not mma this this if you want to

584
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
this is not mma this this if you want to
 

585
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,750
this is not mma this this if you want to
know where does the drill happen

586
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
know where does the drill happen
 

587
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,350
know where does the drill happen
uh so he goes the drill's here when he

588
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
uh so he goes the drill's here when he
 

589
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,710
uh so he goes the drill's here when he
shifts his weight like that

590
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
shifts his weight like that
 

591
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,069
shifts his weight like that
so he shifts his weight to his right leg

592
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
so he shifts his weight to his right leg
 

593
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,829
so he shifts his weight to his right leg
i know he's not kicking one that leg

594
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
i know he's not kicking one that leg
 

595
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,910
i know he's not kicking one that leg
okay so already drill started i got out

596
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
okay so already drill started i got out
 

597
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,590
okay so already drill started i got out
something that i would be able to use

598
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
something that i would be able to use
 

599
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,870
something that i would be able to use
marshally

600

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
outside of this drill okay um
 

603
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,749
outside of this drill okay um
second thing he goes and i'm not ducking

604
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
second thing he goes and i'm not ducking
 

605
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,269
second thing he goes and i'm not ducking
without looking he goes

606
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
without looking he goes
 

607
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,069
without looking he goes
and i pull right there i just got to

608
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
and i pull right there i just got to
 

609
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,670
and i pull right there i just got to
practice a slip

610
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
practice a slip
 

611
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,590
practice a slip
you see am i practicing contestation

612
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
you see am i practicing contestation
 

613
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,030
you see am i practicing contestation
no no it's no different than

is not but the spiral is because i'm
just moving into

684
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
just moving into
 

685
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,510
just moving into
the space either he was occupying or i

686
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
the space either he was occupying or i
 

687
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,230
the space either he was occupying or i
was occupying

688
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
was occupying
 

689
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,950
was occupying
so that is a better yin space a better

690
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
so that is a better yin space a better
 

691
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,350
so that is a better yin space a better
non-contest station

692
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
non-contest station
 

693
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,590
non-contest station
when i do the other one this skin space

694
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
when i do the other one this skin space
 

695
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,430
when i do the other one this skin space
it's i'm always without the initiative

696
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
it's i'm always without the initiative
 

697
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,070
it's i'm always without the initiative
he has it he's going to keep it he keeps

698
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
he has it he's going to keep it he keeps
 

699
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,470
he has it he's going to keep it he keeps
it

700
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
it
 

701
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,470
it
he keeps it keeps it i'm never

702
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
he keeps it keeps it i'm never
 

703
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,950
he keeps it keeps it i'm never
going to be able to turn this around

704
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
going to be able to turn this around
 

705
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,590
going to be able to turn this around
until

706
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600

 

707
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,990

the theory of the line hits me in the

708
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
the theory of the line hits me in the
 

709
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,909
the theory of the line hits me in the
face

710
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
face
 

711
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,070
face
then i'll realize well that didn't work

712
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
then i'll realize well that didn't work
 

713
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,350
then i'll realize well that didn't work
okay

714
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
okay
 

715
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,470
okay
so i don't ever go

716
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
so i don't ever go
 

717
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,789
so i don't ever go
your turn my turn no

718
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799

 

719
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,470

his turn is my turn his turn is my turn

720

whatever he's doing is my turn

722
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600

 

723
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,990

if for some reason it's not i can't tell

724
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
if for some reason it's not i can't tell
 

725
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,870

what he's doing
i took the linear line don't

728
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
i took the linear line don't
 

729
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,830
i took the linear line don't
look this is a bad posture

730
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
look this is a bad posture
 

731
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,350
look this is a bad posture
so to go here go and try to deal with

732
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
so to go here go and try to deal with
 

733
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,990
so to go here go and try to deal with
this i'm not going to be able to do it

734
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
this i'm not going to be able to do it
 

735
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,909
this i'm not going to be able to do it
so dance out boom start to drill over

736
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
so dance out boom start to drill over
 

737
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,830
so dance out boom start to drill over
again

738
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
again
 

739
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,029
again
don't dance out on a straight line

740
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
don't dance out on a straight line
 

741
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,710
don't dance out on a straight line
so this is not realistic

742
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720

 

743
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,909

no never going to happen real life

744
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
no never going to happen real life
 

745
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,990
no never going to happen real life
you won't have that you won't be able to

746
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
you won't have that you won't be able to
 

747
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,430
you won't have that you won't be able to
reverse that initiative

748
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
reverse that initiative
 

749
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,029
reverse that initiative
you're going to be caught the mind is

750
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
you're going to be caught the mind is
 

751
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,950
you're going to be caught the mind is
getting smaller and smaller and smaller

752
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
getting smaller and smaller and smaller
 

753
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,310
getting smaller and smaller and smaller
you're going to get your weight back on

754
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
you're going to get your weight back on
 

755
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,990
you're going to get your weight back on
your heels you're not going to be able

756
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
your heels you're not going to be able
 

757
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,430
your heels you're not going to be able
to do it

758
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
to do it
 

759
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,830
to do it
so look for the first one

760
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
so look for the first one
 

761
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,110
so look for the first one
boom that's the one i want

762
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
boom that's the one i want
 

763
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,350
boom that's the one i want
if not the first one maybe the second

764
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
if not the first one maybe the second
 

765
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,390
if not the first one maybe the second
one

767
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,549

if i can't get it in one or two if i

768
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
if i can't get it in one or two if i
 

769
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,870
if i can't get it in one or two if i
can't get a tactile connection

770
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
can't get a tactile connection
 

771
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,270
can't get a tactile connection
in one or two in training dance out

772
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
in one or two in training dance out
 

773
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,830
in one or two in training dance out
don't start practicing this weird

774
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
don't start practicing this weird
 

775
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,190
don't start practicing this weird
understanding of non-contestation

776
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
understanding of non-contestation
 

777
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,750
understanding of non-contestation
it's not too gypsy

778
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760

 

779
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,789

um next thing

780
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
um next thing
 

781
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,190
um next thing
again don't chase the technique

782
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
again don't chase the technique
 

783
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,110
again don't chase the technique
don't chase the technique i don't know

784
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
don't chase the technique i don't know
 

785
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,950
don't chase the technique i don't know
what technique i'm going to do

786
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
what technique i'm going to do
 

787
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,669
what technique i'm going to do
i can read your body i'll move in a way

788
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
i can read your body i'll move in a way
 

789

that i'm not contesting
 

791
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,149
that i'm not contesting
i'll seek a spirally geometry but i

792
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
i'll seek a spirally geometry but i
 

793
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,230
i'll seek a spirally geometry but i
don't have a technique in mind

794
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
don't have a technique in mind
 

795
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,070
don't have a technique in mind
okay so what do i have in mind just odds

796
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
okay so what do i have in mind just odds
 

797
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,110
okay so what do i have in mind just odds
just odds so as i already said

798
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
just odds so as i already said

just odds so as i already said
if you look at it go this is a better

800
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
if you look at it go this is a better

odd
than this so i took that one

804
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
than this so i took that one
 

805
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,310

this hand
so pull this arm off of me can you see

830
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
so pull this arm off of me can you see
 

831
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:08,950
so pull this arm off of me can you see
then i follow it in

832
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960

 

833
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,590

don't pick your techniques if i don't

834
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
don't pick your techniques if i don't
 

835
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,190
don't pick your techniques if i don't
know what to do

836
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
know what to do
 

837
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,110
know what to do
get out don't know what to do

get out don't know what to do
 

839
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,870
get out don't know what to do
get out on the angle

840
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880

 

841
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,310

if i get the tactile connection boom go

842
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
if i get the tactile connection boom go
 

843
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,549
if i get the tactile connection boom go
don't pick it keep moving towards the

844
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
don't pick it keep moving towards the
 

845
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,230
don't pick it keep moving towards the
back keep spiraling

846
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
back keep spiraling
 

847
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,149
back keep spiraling
keep yielding go

848
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159

 

849
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,510
