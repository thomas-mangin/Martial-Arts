00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
and then romantically they come to
 

239
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,710
and then romantically they come to
believe these things are possible

240
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720

then he pushes back i'm not stopping
 

251
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,790
then he pushes back i'm not stopping
this i'm getting out of the way that

252
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
this i'm getting out of the way that
 

253
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,029
this i'm getting out of the way that
punch

254
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
punch
 

255
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,749
punch
though i never stopped it and then he's

already down

258
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
already down
 

259
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,070

i'm here i'm i'm perfectly fine here

306
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
i'm here i'm i'm perfectly fine here
 

307
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,870

but he's pulling out and rather than

308
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
but he's pulling out and rather than
 

309
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,870
but he's pulling out and rather than
going like this

310
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
going like this
 

311
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,070
going like this
i let him go to the next control point

312
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
i let him go to the next control point
 

313
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,110

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
so i'm never forcing him
 

317
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,230

then i don't like the turtle because he

318
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
then i don't like the turtle because he
 

319
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,230
then i don't like the turtle because he
has a lot of leverage

320
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
has a lot of leverage
 

321
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,350
has a lot of leverage
so i just move it over

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360

 

323
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,190
