88
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
with one loss each. Therefore, it means
 

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,149
with one loss each. Therefore, it means
it needs to go to a decider for the

it needs to go to a decider for the
 

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,550

final.

couldn't finish the choke, so I had to
 

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,930
couldn't finish the choke, so I had to
drive Rob back out the ring for the win.

106
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:24,940
drive Rob back out the ring for the win.

I'm not sure what happened there. I was

188
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm not sure what happened there. I was
 

189
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,150
I'm not sure what happened there. I was
close to throwing him. However, my leg

190
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
close to throwing him. However, my leg
 

191
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,710
close to throwing him. However, my leg
gave way at the last moment. This meant

192
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
gave way at the last moment. This meant
 

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,150
gave way at the last moment. This meant
I'd lost the bout and had been knocked

194
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
I'd lost the bout and had been knocked
 

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,230
I'd lost the bout and had been knocked
out progressing further. I was due to

196
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
out progressing further. I was due to
 

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,149
out progressing further. I was due to
fighting open weight as well. However,

198
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
fighting open weight as well. However,
 

199
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,829
fighting open weight as well. However,
my injury was getting worse. So, I

200
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
my injury was getting worse. So, I
 

201
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,430
my injury was getting worse. So, I
thought I'd do the sensible thing and

202
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
thought I'd do the sensible thing and
 

203
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,430
thought I'd do the sensible thing and
drop out. I was happy with getting

204
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
drop out. I was happy with getting
 

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,949
drop out. I was happy with getting
golden lightweight, but I was concerned

206
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
golden lightweight, but I was concerned
 

207
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,430
golden lightweight, but I was concerned
about my injury.

208
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
about my injury.
 

209
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,350
about my injury.
Two days later, I decided to go to the

210
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
Two days later, I decided to go to the
 

211
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,910
Two days later, I decided to go to the
hospital and after several X-rays and an

212
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
hospital and after several X-rays and an
 

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,470
hospital and after several X-rays and an
MRI scan, it turned out luckily my neck

214
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
MRI scan, it turned out luckily my neck
 

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,310
MRI scan, it turned out luckily my neck
had just been strained. However, they

216
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
had just been strained. However, they
 

217
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,070
had just been strained. However, they
did find that I had fractured my ribs

218
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
did find that I had fractured my ribs
 

219
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,550
did find that I had fractured my ribs
and sternum. I hadn't even noticed this

220
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
and sternum. I hadn't even noticed this
 

221
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,310
and sternum. I hadn't even noticed this
initially. It could have happened when I

222
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
initially. It could have happened when I
 

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,230
initially. It could have happened when I
injured my neck or perhaps during one of

224
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
injured my neck or perhaps during one of
 

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,310
injured my neck or perhaps during one of
my other two losses in middleweight.

226
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
my other two losses in middleweight.
 

227
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,070
my other two losses in middleweight.
Either way, it's good that I quit when I

228
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
Either way, it's good that I quit when I
 

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,750
Either way, it's good that I quit when I
did, otherwise things could have got

230
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
did, otherwise things could have got
 

231
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,310
did, otherwise things could have got
much worse. I was told I need to rest it

232
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
much worse. I was told I need to rest it
 

233
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,310
much worse. I was told I need to rest it
for 6 weeks and so far it's healing

234
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
for 6 weeks and so far it's healing
 

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,310
for 6 weeks and so far it's healing
pretty well. Lastly, I just want to give

236
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
pretty well. Lastly, I just want to give
 

237
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,990
pretty well. Lastly, I just want to give
a shout out to the lads over at Barnsley
