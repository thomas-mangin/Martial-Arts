it's given length and you move into the
 

177
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,740
it's given length and you move into the
space then he must be displaced from

178
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:57,750
space then he must be displaced from
 

179
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,730
space then he must be displaced from
that so there's no pushing of him do you

180
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:01,740
that so there's no pushing of him do you
 

181
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,100
