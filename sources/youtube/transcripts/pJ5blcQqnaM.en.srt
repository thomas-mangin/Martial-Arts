00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,550

hopefully hopefully I'm working on a

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
hopefully hopefully I'm working on a
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,710
hopefully hopefully I'm working on a
different level than yourselves what I'm

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:05,720
different level than yourselves what I'm
 

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,190
different level than yourselves what I'm
doing is we all know that the shape of

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,200
doing is we all know that the shape of
 

7
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,030
doing is we all know that the shape of
the will

8
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,040
the will
 

9
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,430
the will
be an arched

10
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,440
be an arched
 

11
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,789
be an arched
back but a lot of you are not getting to

12
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:15,799
back but a lot of you are not getting to
 

13
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,070
back but a lot of you are not getting to
that stage so as with I was saying with

14
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,080
that stage so as with I was saying with
 

15
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,429
that stage so as with I was saying with
Danny ear when I said look he wasn't

16
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
Danny ear when I said look he wasn't
 

17
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,429
Danny ear when I said look he wasn't
letting Scott make his full movement and

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
letting Scott make his full movement and
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,310
letting Scott make his full movement and
then turning he was ending it where he

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
then turning he was ending it where he
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,230
then turning he was ending it where he
thought it should be you're doing same

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
thought it should be you're doing same
 

23
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,350
thought it should be you're doing same
with the as this see Jenn is s a little

24
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:34,360
with the as this see Jenn is s a little
 

25
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,750
with the as this see Jenn is s a little
bit bent but that's about all W into the

26
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:38,760
bit bent but that's about all W into the
 

27
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,150
bit bent but that's about all W into the
floor so we all know that we all know

28
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,160
floor so we all know that we all know
 

29
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,110
floor so we all know that we all know
that this is the arch of what really

30
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,120
that this is the arch of what really
 

31
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,189
that this is the arch of what really
should be you should do most of us after

32
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:49,199
should be you should do most of us after
 

33
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,110
should be you should do most of us after
you get to

34
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
you get to
 

35
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,709
you get to
about you should definitely know so I'm

36
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
about you should definitely know so I'm
 

37
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,310
about you should definitely know so I'm
looking to

38
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
looking to
 

39
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,189
looking to
maximize the benefits healthwise as well

40
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
maximize the benefits healthwise as well
 

41
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,270
maximize the benefits healthwise as well
as get

42
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
as get
 

43
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,270
as get
I'm trying to get

44
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm trying to get
 

45
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,550
I'm trying to get
here so then see Jenny I fall down I

46
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
here so then see Jenny I fall down I
 

47
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,230
here so then see Jenny I fall down I
don't have to do any more

48
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
don't have to do any more
 

49
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,749
don't have to do any more
work cuz unless you can sort of like do

50
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:10,759
work cuz unless you can sort of like do
 

51
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,350
work cuz unless you can sort of like do
a back flip or something get out there

52
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,360
a back flip or something get out there
 

53
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,990
a back flip or something get out there
but at least it maximizes it right so

54
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,000
but at least it maximizes it right so
 

55
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,870
but at least it maximizes it right so
it's this

56
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880

 

57
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,069

maximization and then if I want to be a

58
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:23,079
maximization and then if I want to be a
 

59
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,350
maximization and then if I want to be a
little bit harder put with you guys or

60
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
little bit harder put with you guys or
 

61
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,310
little bit harder put with you guys or
whatever you know I can add that but

62
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
whatever you know I can add that but
 

63
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,350
whatever you know I can add that but
then that makes me de agress but you you

64
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
then that makes me de agress but you you
 

65
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,710
then that makes me de agress but you you
need a some Buzz out

66
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720
need a some Buzz out
 

67
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,670
need a some Buzz out
like long you don't break

68
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680

 

69
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,469

people so she runs out of her own

70
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:43,479
people so she runs out of her own
 

71
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,830
people so she runs out of her own
energy I know

72
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
energy I know
 

73
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,830
energy I know
it's you're it's like trying to go up

74
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
it's you're it's like trying to go up
 

75
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,630
it's you're it's like trying to go up
against a mountain

76
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640

 

77
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,670

it but if you let them run a little bit

78
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
it but if you let them run a little bit
 

79
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,510
it but if you let them run a little bit
further but you've got to get that shape

80
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:58,520
further but you've got to get that shape
 

81
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,910
further but you've got to get that shape
in them so once you get that that shape

82
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:00,920
in them so once you get that that shape
 

83
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,069
in them so once you get that that shape
you see you're nearly into basic you're

84
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079
you see you're nearly into basic you're
 

85
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,910
you see you're nearly into basic you're
nearly into the basic but you you get

86
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:06,920
nearly into the basic but you you get
 

87
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,109
nearly into the basic but you you get
that shape and then you dropping them

88
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
that shape and then you dropping them
 

89
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,550
that shape and then you dropping them
down let's just try that else you're

90
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:11,560
down let's just try that else you're
 

91
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,000
down let's just try that else you're
never going to make
