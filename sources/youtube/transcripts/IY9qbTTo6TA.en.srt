uh
 

61
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,990
uh
the rules of play is it's somewhere

62
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
the rules of play is it's somewhere
 

63
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,030
the rules of play is it's somewhere
between kihon waza and g wasn't so g was

64
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
between kihon waza and g wasn't so g was
 

65
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,830
between kihon waza and g wasn't so g was
as anything goes well that's not it and

66
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
as anything goes well that's not it and
 

67
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,750
as anything goes well that's not it and
then kihon was says everything is

68
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
then kihon was says everything is
 

69
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,429
then kihon was says everything is
prescribed do you see

70
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
prescribed do you see
 

71
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,670
prescribed do you see
but in play

72
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
but in play
 

73
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,710
but in play
um

74
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
um
 

75
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,270
um
the nagy gets to do whatever technique

76
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
the nagy gets to do whatever technique
 

77
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,070
the nagy gets to do whatever technique
they want to do with within the set

78
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
they want to do with within the set
 

79
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,390
they want to do with within the set
parameters that you're working on okay

80
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
parameters that you're working on okay
 

81
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,230
parameters that you're working on okay
so here we're doing we're working on

82
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
so here we're doing we're working on
 

83
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,910
so here we're doing we're working on
mount reversals and just some of the

84
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
mount reversals and just some of the
 

85
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,030
mount reversals and just some of the
basic attacks from there okay

86
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
basic attacks from there okay
 

87
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,710
basic attacks from there okay
um

88
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
um
 

89
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,710
um
and then the uk is still pretty

90
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
and then the uk is still pretty
 

91
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,710
and then the uk is still pretty
controlled do you see so they're just

92
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
controlled do you see so they're just
 

93
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,630
controlled do you see so they're just
staying in their administrative starting

94
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
staying in their administrative starting
 

95
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,310
staying in their administrative starting
position and letting you do the

96
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
position and letting you do the
 

97
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,190
position and letting you do the
techniques do you see um it's it's a

98
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
techniques do you see um it's it's a
 

99
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,789
techniques do you see um it's it's a
step towards gus do you understand okay

100
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
step towards gus do you understand okay
 

101
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,789
step towards gus do you understand okay
but only if i play right

102
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
but only if i play right
 

103
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,749
but only if i play right
okay

104
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
okay
 

105
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,830
okay
if you start doing some weird stuff

106
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
if you start doing some weird stuff
 

107
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,109
if you start doing some weird stuff
right uh then we're not going to use it

108
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
right uh then we're not going to use it
 

109
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,749
right uh then we're not going to use it
as a stepping stone okay so for example

110
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
as a stepping stone okay so for example
 

111
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,469
as a stepping stone okay so for example
in g was i can't take pauses

112
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
in g was i can't take pauses
 

113
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,109
in g was i can't take pauses
i can't pause any pause that i make as

114
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
i can't pause any pause that i make as
 

115
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,350
i can't pause any pause that i make as
the naga is an escape they're out

116
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
the naga is an escape they're out
 

117
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,029
the naga is an escape they're out
they're gone okay

118
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
they're gone okay
 

119
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,309
they're gone okay
um

120
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
um
 

121
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,110
um
since i'm playing i get to decide the

122
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
since i'm playing i get to decide the
 

123
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,150
since i'm playing i get to decide the
pace

124
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
pace
 

125
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,470
pace
so you can go as slow as you want but

126
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
so you can go as slow as you want but
 

127
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,630
so you can go as slow as you want but
the tempo must remain

128
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
the tempo must remain
 

129
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,510
the tempo must remain
constant we can't have a pause in there

130
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
constant we can't have a pause in there
 

131
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,630
constant we can't have a pause in there
do you get it

132
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
do you get it
 

133
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,949
do you get it
and then you want to obey all of the

134
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
and then you want to obey all of the
 

135
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,750
and then you want to obey all of the
principles of not only the basics you're

136
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
principles of not only the basics you're
 

137
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,390
principles of not only the basics you're
working on but the larger principles and

138
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
working on but the larger principles and
 

139
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,229
working on but the larger principles and
the strategy

140
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
the strategy
 

141
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,509
the strategy
of the art so no space remain heavy

142
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
of the art so no space remain heavy
 

143
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,869
of the art so no space remain heavy
right and non-contestation be relaxed

144
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
right and non-contestation be relaxed
 

145
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,589
right and non-contestation be relaxed
okay uh do you understand it doesn't do

146
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
okay uh do you understand it doesn't do

149
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,430
any good that you're in here and you're
doing the basics incorrectly or you're

150
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
doing the basics incorrectly or you're
 

151
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,990
doing the basics incorrectly or you're
violating principles or strategy or that

152
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
violating principles or strategy or that
 

153
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,470
violating principles or strategy or that
you're not relaxed okay or that you have

154
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
you're not relaxed okay or that you have
 

155
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,750
you're not relaxed okay or that you have
these pauses in there all right so

control conditions
 

183
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,430
control conditions
is if i have to use a lot of strength or

a lot of movement that lock is not going
to work under live conditions so you

188
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
to work under live conditions so you
 

189
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,710
to work under live conditions so you
should

190
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
should
 

191
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,949
should
test yourself

uh koku roku pin because that's not an

236
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
uh koku roku pin because that's not an
 

237
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,110
uh koku roku pin because that's not an
actual pin so you either have to

238
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
actual pin so you either have to
 

239
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,710
actual pin so you either have to
actually have a pin

240
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
actually have a pin
 

241
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,830
actually have a pin
uh maybe go into your network

242
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
uh maybe go into your network
 

243
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,469
uh maybe go into your network
or get some of your other

244
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
or get some of your other
 

245
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,110
or get some of your other
multi-limb controls or you go with some

246
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
multi-limb controls or you go with some
 

247
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,189
multi-limb controls or you go with some
sort of break or dislocation that they

248
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
sort of break or dislocation that they
 

249
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,629
sort of break or dislocation that they
tap out of or you're doing a projection

250
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
tap out of or you're doing a projection
 

251
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,950
tap out of or you're doing a projection
okay and projection means

252
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
okay and projection means
 

253
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,469
okay and projection means
away from me

254
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
away from me
 

255
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,510
away from me
not under me okay if you threw someone

256
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
not under me okay if you threw someone
 

257
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,830
not under me okay if you threw someone
and they landed under you you have to do

258
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
and they landed under you you have to do
 

259
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,670
and they landed under you you have to do
one of those other two

260
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
one of those other two
 

261
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,070
one of those other two
or stomps or kicks or something like

262
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
or stomps or kicks or something like
 

263
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,710
or stomps or kicks or something like
that or you have to move yourself away

264
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
that or you have to move yourself away
 

265
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,189
that or you have to move yourself away
projection means they're away and then

266
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
projection means they're away and then
 

267
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,070
projection means they're away and then
the play would simulate um that's where

268
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
the play would simulate um that's where
 

269
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,749
the play would simulate um that's where
you would draw your weapon or make your

270
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
you would draw your weapon or make your
 

271
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,189
you would draw your weapon or make your
escape okay

272
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
escape okay
 

273
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,550
escape okay
um

274
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
um
 

275
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,710
um
but then also you're trying to harmonize

276
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
but then also you're trying to harmonize
 

277
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,909
but then also you're trying to harmonize
yin

278
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919

279
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,950
yin
so anything that you have to use a

280
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
so anything that you have to use a
 

281
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,029
so anything that you have to use a
muscle here just that's not going to

282
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
muscle here just that's not going to
 

283
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,270
muscle here just that's not going to
work just like him that was okay

284
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
work just like him that was okay
 

285
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,670
work just like him that was okay
and then uh

286
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680

 

287
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,870

let's just try

288
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
let's just try
 

289
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,990
let's just try
okay so he keeps moving and he's always

290
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
okay so he keeps moving and he's always
 

291
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,749
okay so he keeps moving and he's always
going to sleep

292
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
going to sleep
 

293
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:45,430
going to sleep
okay

294
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440

 

295
00:06:45,440 --> 00:07:01,589

so

296
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599

 

297
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,469

so i keep moving he keeps moving

298
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
so i keep moving he keeps moving
 

299
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,029
so i keep moving he keeps moving
i don't have to go fast

300
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
i don't have to go fast
 

301
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,830
i don't have to go fast
i don't have to go hard okay

302
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
i don't have to go hard okay
 

303
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,749
i don't have to go hard okay
got it all right do you see how it just

304
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
got it all right do you see how it just
 

305
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,990
got it all right do you see how it just
keeps moving flowing flowing all right

306
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
keeps moving flowing flowing all right
 

307
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,629
keeps moving flowing flowing all right
let's try i know his throat looks a

308
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
let's try i know his throat looks a
 

309
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,029
let's try i know his throat looks a
little violent and stuff but sometimes

310
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
little violent and stuff but sometimes
 

311
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,589
little violent and stuff but sometimes

get right
 

319
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,909
get right
um but you want to train at that level

320
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
um but you want to train at that level
 

321
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,950

especially in play okay so i don't want
 

323
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,390
especially in play okay so i don't want
to do this technique like this

324
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400

 

325
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,950

that that's not sumiya touch

326
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
that that's not sumiya touch
 

327
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,070
that that's not sumiya touch
okay

328
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
okay
 

329
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,390
okay
do you see that was a young young clash

330
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
do you see that was a young young clash
 

331
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,189

okay
 

333
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,350
okay
so i'm doing all these techniques up

334
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
so i'm doing all these techniques up
 

335
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,430
so i'm doing all these techniques up
here

336
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
here
 

337
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,029
here
all these are here
