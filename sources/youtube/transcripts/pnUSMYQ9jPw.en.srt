why that position exists and and why we

64
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
why that position exists and and why we
 

65
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,789
why that position exists and and why we
do need to train against a strike that's

66
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
do need to train against a strike that's
 

67
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,590
do need to train against a strike that's
done like that

68
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
done like that
 

69
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,270
done like that
because of systematically the way we

70
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
because of systematically the way we
 

71
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,429
because of systematically the way we
look at it so the ski in aikido has a

72
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
look at it so the ski in aikido has a
 

73
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,950
look at it so the ski in aikido has a
very particular reason that it's done

74
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
very particular reason that it's done
 

75
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,429
very particular reason that it's done
that way

76
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
that way
 

77
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,550
that way
and we're going to talk about that in

78
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
and we're going to talk about that in
 

79
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,670
and we're going to talk about that in

strikes

88
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
strikes
 

89
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590
strikes
last video we talked about showman yokom

90
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600

and gyaku yokoman and what those are and
 

93
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,030
and gyaku yokoman and what those are and
and how they might arise and hopefully

94
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
and how they might arise and hopefully
 

95
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,710
and how they might arise and hopefully
by the end of that video you're like oh

96
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
by the end of that video you're like oh
 

97
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,390
by the end of that video you're like oh
those strikes are actually pretty

98
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
those strikes are actually pretty
 

99
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,990
those strikes are actually pretty
sensible and they're not as weird as i

100
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
sensible and they're not as weird as i
 

101
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,550
sensible and they're not as weird as i
thought

102
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
thought
 

103
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,910
thought
um and the reason for that is because

104
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
um and the reason for that is because
 

105
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,429
um and the reason for that is because
we're always trying to make a distance

106
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
we're always trying to make a distance
 

107
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:37,910
we're always trying to make a distance
where

108
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
where
 

109
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,830
where
a boxing situation is not going to

110
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
a boxing situation is not going to
 

111
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,749
a boxing situation is not going to
happen right so so understand if

112
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
happen right so so understand if
 

113
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,950
happen right so so understand if
josh and i were going to box right so if

114
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
josh and i were going to box right so if
 

115
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,069
josh and i were going to box right so if
we were both getting ready to box so

116
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
we were both getting ready to box so
 

117
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,429
we were both getting ready to box so
we're here in a hands up situation we're

118
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
we're here in a hands up situation we're
 

119
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,990
we're here in a hands up situation we're
going to box

120
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
going to box
 

121
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,030
going to box
okay we're going to set a distance where

122
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
okay we're going to set a distance where
 

123
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,710
okay we're going to set a distance where
we can hit each other right

124
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
we can hit each other right
 

125
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,630
we can hit each other right
now that distance is basically mutual

126
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
now that distance is basically mutual
 

127
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,789
now that distance is basically mutual
meaning if josh throws that punch out

128
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
meaning if josh throws that punch out
 

129
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,069
meaning if josh throws that punch out
and i return this shot

130
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
and i return this shot
 

131
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,670
and i return this shot
we're basically hitting each other about

132
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
we're basically hitting each other about
 

133
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,429
we're basically hitting each other about
the same set of distances right

134
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
the same set of distances right
 

135
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,149
the same set of distances right
so that means i can't really get too far

136
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
so that means i can't really get too far
 

137
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,190
so that means i can't really get too far
away from him

138
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
away from him
 

139
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,109
away from him
if i want to hit him back so if what i

140
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
if i want to hit him back so if what i
 

141
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,550
if i want to hit him back so if what i
think i'm doing to josh is trying to hit

142
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
think i'm doing to josh is trying to hit
 

143
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,270
think i'm doing to josh is trying to hit
him back

144
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
him back
 

145
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,109
him back
then i can never get that far out of

146
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
then i can never get that far out of
 

147
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,469
then i can never get that far out of
distance right so

148
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
distance right so
 

149
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,790
distance right so
um the the strikes in aikido don't come

150
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
