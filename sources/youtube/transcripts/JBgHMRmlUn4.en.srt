but
perhaps i

96
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
perhaps i
 

97
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,670
perhaps i
perhaps i

98
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
perhaps i
 

99
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,390
perhaps i
do have a guide perhaps if there is an

101
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,670
do have a guide perhaps if there is an
after

102
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
after
 

103
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,190
after
life

104
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
life

if something leaves our
 

109
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,430
if something leaves our
physical body that's inside us

110
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
physical body that's inside us
 

111
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,070
physical body that's inside us

00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
perhaps
 

119
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,509
perhaps
my soul leaves my body

120
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
my soul leaves my body
