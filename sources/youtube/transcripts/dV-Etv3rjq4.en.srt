1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,510

okay so if we're doing this technique

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
okay so if we're doing this technique
 

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,870
okay so if we're doing this technique
it's right here

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880

 

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,610

my body and

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:10,620
my body and
 

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,049
my body and
I'm just happening to his

8
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:12,059
I'm just happening to his
 

9
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,470
I'm just happening to his
okay so his energy is going that way I'm

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,480
okay so his energy is going that way I'm
 

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,290
okay so his energy is going that way I'm
not gonna pull him back I'm gonna let

12
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:18,300
not gonna pull him back I'm gonna let
 

13
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,830
not gonna pull him back I'm gonna let
him go forward and I curve this

14
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
him go forward and I curve this
 

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,849
him go forward and I curve this
okay

16
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:22,859
okay
 

17
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,109
okay
okay

18
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,119
okay
 

19
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,630
okay
you're doing that intention Noggin not

20
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
you're doing that intention Noggin not
 

21
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,310
you're doing that intention Noggin not
with the hand on his neck but you're

22
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
with the hand on his neck but you're
 

23
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,130
with the hand on his neck but you're
doing it with this hand right here okay

24
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,140
doing it with this hand right here okay
 

25
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,330
doing it with this hand right here okay
so this hand has to make that same Loop

26
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:35,340
so this hand has to make that same Loop
 

27
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,710
so this hand has to make that same Loop
in his body

28
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:37,720
in his body
 

29
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,470
in his body

that means

32
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,340
that means
 

33
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,090
that means
his head is going to go forward

34
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
his head is going to go forward
 

35
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,690
his head is going to go forward
and around and then back and then out

36
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:47,700
and around and then back and then out
 

37
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,150
and around and then back and then out
and that's my pattern there he's going

38
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
and that's my pattern there he's going
 

39
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,529
and that's my pattern there he's going
to go forward

40
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:51,539
to go forward
 

41
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,729
to go forward
around and out okay

42
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739
around and out okay
 

43
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,090
around and out okay
so I'm doing it with this house I'm not

44
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,100
so I'm doing it with this house I'm not
 

45
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,650
so I'm doing it with this house I'm not
going to touch him let me touch your

46
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,660
going to touch him let me touch your
 

47
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,130
going to touch him let me touch your
face I'm not gonna touch his face here

48
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,140
face I'm not gonna touch his face here
 

49
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,250
face I'm not gonna touch his face here
and then crank it over with some

50
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,260
and then crank it over with some
 

51
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,190
and then crank it over with some
imaginary mechanical advantage

52
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,200
imaginary mechanical advantage
 

53
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,550
imaginary mechanical advantage
I'm gonna make his Center move okay oh

54
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm gonna make his Center move okay oh
 

55
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,810
I'm gonna make his Center move okay oh
make his Center move whoa

56
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:20,820

 

57
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,830

cool

58
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

59
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,630

it is I always show

60
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640

 

61
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,310

without the throat he was already

62
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
without the throat he was already
 

63
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,670
without the throat he was already
falling that way hence I say I'm aiming

64
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:34,680
falling that way hence I say I'm aiming
 

65
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:48,190
falling that way hence I say I'm aiming
falling bodies

66
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200

 

67
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,710

so now you take him again

68
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720
so now you take him again
 

69
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,749
so now you take him again
you can do it this way you're going to

70
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
you can do it this way you're going to
 

71
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,030
you can do it this way you're going to
do the same exact thing it's just like

72
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,040
do the same exact thing it's just like
 

73
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,490
do the same exact thing it's just like
didn't you knock it but it's this side

74
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:58,500
didn't you knock it but it's this side
 

75
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:13,480
didn't you knock it but it's this side
so I move him around oh

76

81
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,449

not his head hitting and pull out

82
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,459
not his head hitting and pull out
 

83
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,490
not his head hitting and pull out
you take his Center you move your Center

84
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,500

96
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:19,500

 

97
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,050

here you made contact
pay attention no contact he's moving

106
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:34,019
pay attention no contact he's moving
 

107
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:46,570
pay attention no contact he's moving
around

108
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:46,580

 

109
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,830

do you get that

do you get that
I don't know is that a good angle

112
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:51,299
I don't know is that a good angle
 

113
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,309

shinsuke did you're hitting
 

119
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,270
shinsuke did you're hitting
and then you're

120

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
it's not my arm goes forward
 

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,250
it's not my arm goes forward
and then I do it

128

final rotating I'm working at that
 

139
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,770
final rotating I'm working at that
energetic alchemical level okay that's

140
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:45,780
energetic alchemical level okay that's
 

141
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,270
energetic alchemical level okay that's
all I'm doing

142
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
all I'm doing
 

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,850

sometimes you do one side sometimes you

sometimes you do one side sometimes you
 

147
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,469
sometimes you do one side sometimes you
do both sides okay but it's the same

148
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
do both sides okay but it's the same
 

149
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,030
do both sides okay but it's the same
pattern every time all throughout key

150
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,040
pattern every time all throughout key
 

151

pattern every time all throughout key
one wasn't all right try it again when I

152
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,440
one wasn't all right try it again when I
 

153
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,070
one wasn't all right try it again when I
say that I don't try to throw him that I

154
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
say that I don't try to throw him that I
 

155
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,990
say that I don't try to throw him that I
just do this

156
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000
just do this
 

157
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,629
just do this
that's that that's why this would feel

158
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
that's that that's why this would feel
