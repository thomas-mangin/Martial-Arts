three things you need to get

three things you need to get
okay the first one is stay in the back

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
okay the first one is stay in the back
 

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,030
okay the first one is stay in the back
and the second one is learn to lock his

and the second one is learn to lock his
 

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,390

then the third one is

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
then the third one is
 

13
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,790
then the third one is
let the energy

i'm going to say for this uk and the

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,430
i'm going to say for this uk and the
amount of energy that he's given me i

112
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
amount of energy that he's given me i
 

113
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,589

can't do the 180 it's it's bigger than

00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
can't do the 180 it's it's bigger than

so if you want to ask yourself so the

120
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
so if you want to ask yourself so the
 

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,110
so if you want to ask yourself so the
180 i should be facing that way at the

180 i should be facing that way at the
 

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,270
180 i should be facing that way at the
end of the tank but if you if you ask

124
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
end of the tank but if you if you ask
 

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,990
end of the tank but if you if you ask
yourself oh where where are my faces

126
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000

 

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,670
