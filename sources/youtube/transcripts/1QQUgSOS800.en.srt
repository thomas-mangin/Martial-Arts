00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:04,580
here and now you have not cleared the
line of attempt you get that

86
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:04,590
line of attempt you get that
 

87

182
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:33,380

 

183
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:41,410

don't try to touch it okay you're not

184
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:41,420
don't try to touch it okay you're not
 

185
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:52,290
don't try to touch it okay you're not
gonna do this stuff on jabs

186
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,300

 

187
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,900

so I'm jabbing just move up don't get

188
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:57,910
so I'm jabbing just move up don't get
 

189
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,180
so I'm jabbing just move up don't get
killed keep your keep your right the

190
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,190
killed keep your keep your right the
 

191
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,460
killed keep your keep your right the
problem is that my whole friggin body's

192
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:05,470
problem is that my whole friggin body's
 

193
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,110
problem is that my whole friggin body's
coming in so we'll go slow and he just

194
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,120
coming in so we'll go slow and he just
 

195
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,230
coming in so we'll go slow and he just
may take the range but my gonna say that

196
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
may take the range but my gonna say that
 

197
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
may take the range but my gonna say that
my body's not chapter now so I'm goes to

198
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,610
my body's not chapter now so I'm goes to
 

199
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,120
my body's not chapter now so I'm goes to
show you get on the same page as me

200
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,130
show you get on the same page as me
 

201
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,380
show you get on the same page as me
right he goes back right you see no

202
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,390
right he goes back right you see no
 

203
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,930
right he goes back right you see no
problem and that's more efficient for

204
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:27,940
problem and that's more efficient for
 

205
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,480
problem and that's more efficient for
him but if my whole body's come in and

206
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,490
him but if my whole body's come in and
 

207
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,630
him but if my whole body's come in and
he tries to go back full everything's

208
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:33,640
he tries to go back full everything's
 

209
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,140
he tries to go back full everything's
coming that way I'm gonna catch him

210
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,150

 

211
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,430

that's what's making where you're

212
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
that's what's making where you're
 

213
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,170
that's what's making where you're
stepping up here Fievel your little step

214
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,180
stepping up here Fievel your little step
 

215
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,990
stepping up here Fievel your little step
let's do the technique your little step

216
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
let's do the technique your little step
 

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,290
let's do the technique your little step
right here so here was where my scheme

218
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,300
right here so here was where my scheme
 

219
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,460
right here so here was where my scheme
was and you went six inches forward and

220
00:07:59,460 --> 00:07:59,470
was and you went six inches forward and
 

221
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,530
was and you went six inches forward and
off to the side and that's causing this

222
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,540
off to the side and that's causing this
 

223
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,120
off to the side and that's causing this
problem

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,130

 

225
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,330

but when I ski fully I can't make that

226
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,340
but when I ski fully I can't make that
 

227
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,620
but when I ski fully I can't make that
step why

228
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,630

 

229
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,490

you're in deeper okay page eight

230
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:17,500
you're in deeper okay page eight
 

231
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,690
you're in deeper okay page eight
backflip coming off the ground it's too

232
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:21,700
backflip coming off the ground it's too
 

233
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,160
backflip coming off the ground it's too
much inertia too much momentum okay that

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,170
much inertia too much momentum okay that
 

235
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,830
much inertia too much momentum okay that
my balance will not be there so if you

236
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
my balance will not be there so if you
 

237
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,969
my balance will not be there so if you
guys remember in the weapons to you

238
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:32,979
guys remember in the weapons to you
 

239
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,940
guys remember in the weapons to you
you'll have your shooting platform when

240
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:35,950
you'll have your shooting platform when
 

241
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,920
you'll have your shooting platform when
we're static but when I ask you to

242
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:37,930
we're static but when I ask you to
 

243
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,190

you you're gonna have to put that foot

246
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,490
you you're gonna have to put that foot
 

247
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,770
you you're gonna have to put that foot
out to deal with in the residual inertia

248
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:46,780
out to deal with in the residual inertia
 

249
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,580
out to deal with in the residual inertia
right so when I do that when I do the

250
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:50,590
right so when I do that when I do the
 

251
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,880
right so when I do that when I do the
ski you can't you cannot put your foot

you understand that and in fact your
 

257
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,580
you understand that and in fact your
state you're gonna you're gonna cut as

258
00:08:59,580 --> 00:08:59,590
state you're gonna you're gonna cut as
 

259
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,350
state you're gonna you're gonna cut as
hard as you can on the technique right

260
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
hard as you can on the technique right
 

261
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,860

forces in the center okay so the center

340
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:21,669
forces in the center okay so the center
 

341
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,869
forces in the center okay so the center
must move if your center is staying

still in space you just look here if
 

345
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,549
still in space you just look here if
it's staying still in space go but you

346
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:32,559
it's staying still in space go but you
 

347
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,439
it's staying still in space go but you
did not do Kenny you're gonna get hurt

it briefly the in space is as he starts
 

383
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,079
it briefly the in space is as he starts
to go slowly right here's the in space

to go slowly right here's the in space
 

385
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,069
to go slowly right here's the in space
to see that the you space is not it's

404
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:54,569
in space fully so as he starts to go I
 

405
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,840
in space fully so as he starts to go I
know he's not going to hit me and I keep
