00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,829
hi i'm christopher hine and today we're
going to be talking about more of the

4
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
going to be talking about more of the
 

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,549
going to be talking about more of the
fundamental theory of sword work so i'm

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
fundamental theory of sword work so i'm
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,230
fundamental theory of sword work so i'm
going to cover just a few other basic

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
going to cover just a few other basic
 

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,990
going to cover just a few other basic
concepts of sword work these are things

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
concepts of sword work these are things
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,230
concepts of sword work these are things
that often get glossed over and that no

12
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
that often get glossed over and that no
 

13
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,950
that often get glossed over and that no
one really tells you about and that's a

14
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
one really tells you about and that's a
 

15
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,710
one really tells you about and that's a
weird thing to say because these things

16
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
weird thing to say because these things
 

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,950
weird thing to say because these things
aren't like secrets but they're also

18
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
aren't like secrets but they're also
 

19
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,429
aren't like secrets but they're also
just so kind of trivial and boring in

20
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
just so kind of trivial and boring in
 

21
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,950
just so kind of trivial and boring in
lots of ways that i think people gloss

22
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
lots of ways that i think people gloss
 

23
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,470
lots of ways that i think people gloss
over them and if you don't understand

24
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
over them and if you don't understand
 

25
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,630
over them and if you don't understand
these trivial boring things you have a

26
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
these trivial boring things you have a
 

27
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,790
these trivial boring things you have a
real hard time understanding a lot of

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
real hard time understanding a lot of
 

29
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,549
real hard time understanding a lot of
the useful stuff that you would find in

30
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
the useful stuff that you would find in
 

31
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,389
the useful stuff that you would find in

okay so let's talk about some some real
 

43
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,310
okay so let's talk about some some real
fundamental sword stuff and this stuff's

44
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
fundamental sword stuff and this stuff's
 

45
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,549
fundamental sword stuff and this stuff's
probably boring but it's so boring that

46
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
probably boring but it's so boring that
 

47
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,709
probably boring but it's so boring that
no one talks about it and these things

no one talks about it and these things
 

49
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,349
no one talks about it and these things
are truly essential skills because if

50
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
are truly essential skills because if
 

51
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,189
are truly essential skills because if
you don't understand these concepts

52
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
you don't understand these concepts
 

53
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,029

okay now
what he's trying to do with this

80
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
what he's trying to do with this
 

81
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,149
what he's trying to do with this
position is protect as much of his body

82
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
position is protect as much of his body
 

83
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,710
position is protect as much of his body
from the sword as possible all right so

84
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
from the sword as possible all right so
 

85
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,789
from the sword as possible all right so
understand that if josh is standing

86
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
understand that if josh is standing
 

87
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,230
understand that if josh is standing
perfectly centered so right now this is

88
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
perfectly centered so right now this is
 

89
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,469
perfectly centered so right now this is
kind of a at ease he's not he's not

90
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
kind of a at ease he's not he's not
 

91
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,429
kind of a at ease he's not he's not
super on guard right okay if the sword

92
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
super on guard right okay if the sword
 

93
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,109
super on guard right okay if the sword
if my sword or the attacker swords on

94
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
if my sword or the attacker swords on
 

95
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,590
if my sword or the attacker swords on
this side and it comes down it's hitting

96
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
this side and it comes down it's hitting
 

97
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,910
this side and it comes down it's hitting
in here and that goes into his body okay

98
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
in here and that goes into his body okay
 

99
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,749
in here and that goes into his body okay
if the sword is right here and it's

100
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
if the sword is right here and it's
 

101
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,069
if the sword is right here and it's
coming in it's hitting his body so when

102
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
coming in it's hitting his body so when
 

103
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,870
coming in it's hitting his body so when
josh truly blades his stance out right

104
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
josh truly blades his stance out right
 

105
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,469
josh truly blades his stance out right
so there he's truly bleeding his stance

106
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
so there he's truly bleeding his stance
 

107
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,870
so there he's truly bleeding his stance
out now if the sword's on this side

108
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
out now if the sword's on this side
 

109
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,149
out now if the sword's on this side
essentially and i understand there's a

110
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
essentially and i understand there's a
 

111
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,230
essentially and i understand there's a
suba right here so it can't go to his

112
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
suba right here so it can't go to his
 

113
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,109
suba right here so it can't go to his
hands his whole body is getting missed

114
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
hands his whole body is getting missed
 

115
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,749
hands his whole body is getting missed
by the other sword so that's why and let

116
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
by the other sword so that's why and let
 

117
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,270
by the other sword so that's why and let
me have a come over here and face me

118
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
me have a come over here and face me
 

119
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,510
me have a come over here and face me
that's why when we're sword to sword

120
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
that's why when we're sword to sword
 

121
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,110
that's why when we're sword to sword
like this we're hiding our bodies behind

122
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
like this we're hiding our bodies behind
 

123
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,229
like this we're hiding our bodies behind
our sword okay now if his sword were to

124
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
our sword okay now if his sword were to
 

125
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,390
our sword okay now if his sword were to
go the other side of this

126
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
go the other side of this
 

127
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,550
go the other side of this
i would have to move my body to the

128
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
i would have to move my body to the
 

129
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,390
i would have to move my body to the
other side of this right now the reason

130
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
other side of this right now the reason
 

131
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,470
other side of this right now the reason
for that is if anything's poking out

132
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
for that is if anything's poking out
 

133
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,550
for that is if anything's poking out
right here and he's got a quick action

134
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
right here and he's got a quick action
 

135
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,309
right here and he's got a quick action
he can come in and get me so what i'm

136
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
he can come in and get me so what i'm
 

137
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,070
he can come in and get me so what i'm
trying to do is protect myself from

138
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
trying to do is protect myself from
 

139
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,390
trying to do is protect myself from
those quick actions so that's what the

140
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
those quick actions so that's what the
 

141
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,630
those quick actions so that's what the
hanumi stance is doing it's blading me

142
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
hanumi stance is doing it's blading me
 

143
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,869
hanumi stance is doing it's blading me
to his actions that way i'm protected

144
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
to his actions that way i'm protected
 

145
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,630
to his actions that way i'm protected
from that sword making a super quick

146
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
from that sword making a super quick
 

147
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,949
from that sword making a super quick
action this is more and more dangerous

148
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
action this is more and more dangerous
 

149
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,869
action this is more and more dangerous
the closer we are so meaning a lot of

150
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
the closer we are so meaning a lot of
 

151
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,869
the closer we are so meaning a lot of
times when people at the foot

152
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
times when people at the foot
 

153
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,390
times when people at the foot
one foot distance

154
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
one foot distance
 

155
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,309
one foot distance
you'll see this where we can kind of be

156
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
you'll see this where we can kind of be
 

157
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,350
you'll see this where we can kind of be
in the middle and this is more

158
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
in the middle and this is more
 

159
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,270
in the middle and this is more
comfortable and it's more mechanically

160
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
comfortable and it's more mechanically
 

161
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,350
comfortable and it's more mechanically
advantageous but as people get closer

162
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
advantageous but as people get closer
 

163
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,869
advantageous but as people get closer
and closer with the swords you see this

164
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
and closer with the swords you see this
 

165
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,390
and closer with the swords you see this
starting to happen because they're

166
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
starting to happen because they're
 

167
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,630
starting to happen because they're
blading themselves and hiding behind

168
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
blading themselves and hiding behind
 

169
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,390
blading themselves and hiding behind
their sword now he's got to move his

170
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
their sword now he's got to move his
 

171
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,990
their sword now he's got to move his
sword over here first and when he does

172
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
sword over here first and when he does
 

173
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
sword over here first and when he does
that i have the chance to move myself to

174
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
that i have the chance to move myself to
 

175
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,390
that i have the chance to move myself to
the other side as well so understanding

176
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
the other side as well so understanding
 

177
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,630
the other side as well so understanding
why stance is happening is really really

178
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
why stance is happening is really really
 

179
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,030
why stance is happening is really really
important so this is kind of a neutral

180
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
important so this is kind of a neutral
 

181
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,110
important so this is kind of a neutral
stance right this is a truly bladed

182
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
stance right this is a truly bladed
 

183
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,309
stance right this is a truly bladed
stance and that's where i want to keep

184
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
stance and that's where i want to keep
 

185
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,630
stance and that's where i want to keep
his sword always on that side and a lot

186
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
his sword always on that side and a lot
 

187
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,070
his sword always on that side and a lot
of times i tell my students especially

188
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
of times i tell my students especially
 

189
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,470
of times i tell my students especially
my younger students it's like a dog and

190
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
my younger students it's like a dog and
 

191
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,550
my younger students it's like a dog and
a fence right so if we're here like this

192
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
a fence right so if we're here like this
 

193
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,789
a fence right so if we're here like this
the sword is my fence and the bad dog's

194
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
the sword is my fence and the bad dog's
 

195
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,710
the sword is my fence and the bad dog's
over there if the dog were to jump the

196
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
over there if the dog were to jump the
 

197
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
over there if the dog were to jump the
fence or bare crawl underneath i'm going

198
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
fence or bare crawl underneath i'm going
 

199
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,550
fence or bare crawl underneath i'm going
to come over here to this other side

200
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
to come over here to this other side
 

201
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,390
to come over here to this other side
right so so whatever that dog does i

202
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
right so so whatever that dog does i
 

203
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,430
right so so whatever that dog does i
want to be on the opposite side of the

204
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
want to be on the opposite side of the
 

205
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,789
want to be on the opposite side of the
fence because that protects me from the

206
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
fence because that protects me from the
 

207
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,430
fence because that protects me from the
dog's quick actions right so that's the

208
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
dog's quick actions right so that's the
 

209
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,789
dog's quick actions right so that's the
first thing to understand about honmey

210
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
first thing to understand about honmey
 

211
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,789
first thing to understand about honmey
and why we stand like that it's a bladed

212
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
and why we stand like that it's a bladed
 

213
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,390
and why we stand like that it's a bladed
position where we're hiding ourselves

214
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
position where we're hiding ourselves
 

215
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
position where we're hiding ourselves
behind the sword from his sword in case

216
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
behind the sword from his sword in case
 

217
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,030
behind the sword from his sword in case
there's a quick action okay now that's

218
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
there's a quick action okay now that's
 

219
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,429
there's a quick action okay now that's
why we stand the way we stand you also

220
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
why we stand the way we stand you also
 

221
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,869
why we stand the way we stand you also
need to understand

222
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
need to understand
 

223
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,670
need to understand
why we make the shots that we make and

224
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
why we make the shots that we make and
 

225
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,270
why we make the shots that we make and
so this is this is going to be in two

226
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
so this is this is going to be in two
 

227
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,470
so this is this is going to be in two
parts the first part is we're going to

228
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
parts the first part is we're going to
 

229
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,949
parts the first part is we're going to
talk about high shots versus low shots

230
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
talk about high shots versus low shots
 

231
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,429
talk about high shots versus low shots
right so for i think for most people not

232
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
right so for i think for most people not
 

233
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,110
right so for i think for most people not
really understanding how weapons work

234
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
really understanding how weapons work
 

235
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,670
really understanding how weapons work
works they think an attack to the leg is

236
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
works they think an attack to the leg is
 

237
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,429
works they think an attack to the leg is
roughly as good as attack to the body is

238
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
roughly as good as attack to the body is
 

239
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,030
roughly as good as attack to the body is
roughly as good as attack to the head

240
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
roughly as good as attack to the head
 

241
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,869
roughly as good as attack to the head
it's roughly as good as attack to any

242
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
it's roughly as good as attack to any
 

243
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,949
it's roughly as good as attack to any
core part of the body and their primary

244
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
core part of the body and their primary
 

245
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,030
core part of the body and their primary
attack should always be done to the core

246
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
attack should always be done to the core
 

247
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,390
attack should always be done to the core
and you know if you took out someone's

248
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
and you know if you took out someone's
 

249
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,990
and you know if you took out someone's
leg well then they can't walk anymore so

250
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
leg well then they can't walk anymore so
 

251
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,510
leg well then they can't walk anymore so
that's a that's a great thing to do

252
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
that's a that's a great thing to do
 

253
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,590
that's a that's a great thing to do
right the problem with that is i'm

254
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
right the problem with that is i'm
 

255
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,150
right the problem with that is i'm
always at an angular disadvantage when i

256
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
always at an angular disadvantage when i
 

257
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,110
always at an angular disadvantage when i
go to a low target okay now the reason

258
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
go to a low target okay now the reason
 

259
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,390
go to a low target okay now the reason
this is is because of the arc my sword

260
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
this is is because of the arc my sword
 

261
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,830
this is is because of the arc my sword
prescribes right so i don't know if

262
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
prescribes right so i don't know if
 

263
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,310
prescribes right so i don't know if
that's the way it's subscribed anyway so

264
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
that's the way it's subscribed anyway so
 

265
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,230
that's the way it's subscribed anyway so
so the way my my the arc that my sword

266
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
so the way my my the arc that my sword
 

267
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,950
so the way my my the arc that my sword
moves on so as i move up

268
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
moves on so as i move up
 

269
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,870
moves on so as i move up
it will start to eventually get shorter

270
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
it will start to eventually get shorter
 

271
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,110
it will start to eventually get shorter
relative to josh and as i move down it

272
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
relative to josh and as i move down it
 

273
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,710
relative to josh and as i move down it
will get shorter relative josh let me

274
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
will get shorter relative josh let me
 

275
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,909
will get shorter relative josh let me
show you what i mean with josh so

276
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
show you what i mean with josh so
 

277
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,950
show you what i mean with josh so
actually just hold your sword to your

278
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
actually just hold your sword to your
 

279
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,830
actually just hold your sword to your
side

280
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
side
 

281
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,749
side
okay so here i am i'm touching josh

282
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
okay so here i am i'm touching josh
 

283
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,030
okay so here i am i'm touching josh
right now so i'm touching him i'm not

284
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
right now so i'm touching him i'm not
 

285
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,310
right now so i'm touching him i'm not
going to change me at all josh isn't

286
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
going to change me at all josh isn't
 

287
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,749
going to change me at all josh isn't
going to change it all now as i drop my

288
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
going to change it all now as i drop my
 

289
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,670
going to change it all now as i drop my
sword watch what happens i all of a

290
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
sword watch what happens i all of a
 

291
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,350
sword watch what happens i all of a
sudden can't touch him and that's

292
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
sudden can't touch him and that's
 

293
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,430
sudden can't touch him and that's
because i'm i'm making a circle

294
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
because i'm i'm making a circle
 

295
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,870
because i'm i'm making a circle
basically here right so this part of the

296
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
basically here right so this part of the
 

297
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,550
basically here right so this part of the
circle is curving away from josh so you

298
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
circle is curving away from josh so you
 

299
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,350
circle is curving away from josh so you
see i can't reach josh nearly as easily

300
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
see i can't reach josh nearly as easily
 

301
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,270
see i can't reach josh nearly as easily
now in a situation where we were sword

302
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
now in a situation where we were sword
 

303
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,950
now in a situation where we were sword
on sword if i choose to attack his legs

304
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
on sword if i choose to attack his legs
 

305
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,950
on sword if i choose to attack his legs
i always put myself in danger there's

306
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
i always put myself in danger there's
 

307
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,790
i always put myself in danger there's
not a way to angle myself out of here

308
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
not a way to angle myself out of here
 

309
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
not a way to angle myself out of here
because he's got such a reach advantage

310
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
because he's got such a reach advantage
 

311
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,350
because he's got such a reach advantage
that i can't counter the reach advantage

312
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
that i can't counter the reach advantage
 

313
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,909
that i can't counter the reach advantage
so choosing to just randomly attack the

314
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
so choosing to just randomly attack the
 

315
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,189
so choosing to just randomly attack the
leg is generally a bad attack now there

316
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
leg is generally a bad attack now there
 

317
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,790
leg is generally a bad attack now there
are exceptions to that and you do see in

318
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
are exceptions to that and you do see in
 

319
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,710
are exceptions to that and you do see in
the aikido forums where we have leg

320
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
the aikido forums where we have leg
 

321
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,990
the aikido forums where we have leg
attacks now those are generally in

322
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
attacks now those are generally in
 

323
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,629
attacks now those are generally in
situations where we're pushed in close

324
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
situations where we're pushed in close
 

325
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,270
situations where we're pushed in close
and being pushed in close is the reason

326
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
and being pushed in close is the reason
 

327
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,029
and being pushed in close is the reason
that we have to

328
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
that we have to
 

329
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,310
that we have to
make a low attack and let me show you

330
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
make a low attack and let me show you
 

331
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,150
make a low attack and let me show you
what i mean so if we were really really

332
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
what i mean so if we were really really
 

333
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,510
what i mean so if we were really really
close and let's say josh is sort of

334
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
close and let's say josh is sort of
 

335
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,710
close and let's say josh is sort of
flown over here and i'm going to make my

336
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
flown over here and i'm going to make my
 

337
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,790
flown over here and i'm going to make my
attack like this and my posture is wrong

338
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
attack like this and my posture is wrong
 

339
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,230
attack like this and my posture is wrong
just because i want to face the camera

340
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
just because i want to face the camera
 

341
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,830
just because i want to face the camera
still while i'm doing this but i've made

342
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
still while i'm doing this but i've made
 

343
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,350
still while i'm doing this but i've made
my attack here and of course i should be

344
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
my attack here and of course i should be
 

345
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,430
my attack here and of course i should be
this way but just to make this work out

346
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
this way but just to make this work out
 

347
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,430
this way but just to make this work out
okay so i'm here like this now i've made

348
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
okay so i'm here like this now i've made
 

349
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,749
okay so i'm here like this now i've made
my attack on josh i'm in the worst part

350
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
my attack on josh i'm in the worst part
 

351
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,909
my attack on josh i'm in the worst part
of my sword to attack so sure it'll hurt

352
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
of my sword to attack so sure it'll hurt
 

353
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,150
of my sword to attack so sure it'll hurt
josh but that's not an ideal attack if i

354
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
josh but that's not an ideal attack if i
 

355
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,230
josh but that's not an ideal attack if i
go here i'm now in the sharpest part of

356
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
go here i'm now in the sharpest part of
 

357
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,670
go here i'm now in the sharpest part of
my sword the best part of my sword the

358
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
my sword the best part of my sword the
 

359
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,029
my sword the best part of my sword the
best part of the lever which means i'm

360
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
best part of the lever which means i'm
 

361
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,790
best part of the lever which means i'm
more likely to go through his leg here

362
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
more likely to go through his leg here
 

363
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,189
more likely to go through his leg here
and stop him than i am here and because

364
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
and stop him than i am here and because
 

365
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,990
and stop him than i am here and because
of the closeness he could hit me anyway

366
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
of the closeness he could hit me anyway
 

367
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,909
of the closeness he could hit me anyway
so i don't have to worry about like

368
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
so i don't have to worry about like
 

369
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,830
so i don't have to worry about like
making an angular advantage or something

370
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
making an angular advantage or something
 

371
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,590
making an angular advantage or something
like that because we're already two heck

372
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
like that because we're already two heck
 

373
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,350
like that because we're already two heck
and close and so you actually see that

374
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
and close and so you actually see that
 

375
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,909
and close and so you actually see that
in the forums now there is one other uh

376
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
in the forums now there is one other uh
 

377
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,510
in the forums now there is one other uh
situation where this happens really

378
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
situation where this happens really
 

379
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,430
situation where this happens really
dominantly in the aikido forms and it's

380
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
dominantly in the aikido forms and it's
 

381
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590
dominantly in the aikido forms and it's
inside the sense a second

382
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
inside the sense a second
 

383
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,110
inside the sense a second
kumi touch and i'm going to talk about

384
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
kumi touch and i'm going to talk about
 

385
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,469
kumi touch and i'm going to talk about
that when we get there

386
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
that when we get there
 

387
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,390
that when we get there
i've changed it because

388
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
i've changed it because
 

389
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,150
i've changed it because
i'm displeased with the way it came off

390
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
i'm displeased with the way it came off
 

391
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,469
i'm displeased with the way it came off
and and i'll explain when we get to that

392
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
and and i'll explain when we get to that
 

393
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,469
and and i'll explain when we get to that
why that is but leg attacks in nikita

394
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
why that is but leg attacks in nikita
 

395
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,990
why that is but leg attacks in nikita
are generally only done when we're close

396
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
are generally only done when we're close
 

397
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,670
are generally only done when we're close
quarters and that's because it works out

398
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
quarters and that's because it works out
 

399
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,510
quarters and that's because it works out
better because of the closeness of the

400
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
better because of the closeness of the
 

401
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,790
better because of the closeness of the
situation

402
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
situation
 

403
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,189
situation
so in general high attacks are better

404
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
so in general high attacks are better
 

405
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,350
so in general high attacks are better
than low attacks because when i attack

406
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
than low attacks because when i attack
 

407
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,510
than low attacks because when i attack
him up here if i reach him up here my

408
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
him up here if i reach him up here my
 

409
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,430
him up here if i reach him up here my
body's farther away than his reach and

410
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
body's farther away than his reach and
 

411
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,430
body's farther away than his reach and
so he can't get me right he can't get my

412
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
so he can't get me right he can't get my
 

413
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,270
so he can't get me right he can't get my
legs can't get my body and that's good

414
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
legs can't get my body and that's good
 

415
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
legs can't get my body and that's good
and then because we now understand how

416
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
and then because we now understand how
 

417
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,790
and then because we now understand how
the timings work out of course if he

418
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
the timings work out of course if he
 

419
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,469
the timings work out of course if he
leaned in i could lean out if he stepped

420
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
leaned in i could lean out if he stepped
 

421
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,309
leaned in i could lean out if he stepped
in i could step out but we get that

422
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
in i could step out but we get that
 

423
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,309
in i could step out but we get that
advantage through high line attacks

424
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
advantage through high line attacks
 

425
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,390
advantage through high line attacks
versus low line attacks so higher line

426
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
versus low line attacks so higher line
 

427
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,629
versus low line attacks so higher line
attacks are better than lower line

428
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
attacks are better than lower line
 

429
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,710
attacks are better than lower line
attacks because of that that arc we

430
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
attacks because of that that arc we
 

431
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,309
attacks because of that that arc we
prescribed now the second part of

432
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
prescribed now the second part of
 

433
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,150
prescribed now the second part of
attacking that you have to understand is

434
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
attacking that you have to understand is
 

435
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,510
attacking that you have to understand is
that attacking the hands is almost

436
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
that attacking the hands is almost
 

437
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,309
that attacking the hands is almost
always better than attacking the body

438
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
always better than attacking the body
 

439
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,390
always better than attacking the body
now that doesn't seem like it's very

440
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
now that doesn't seem like it's very
 

441
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,629
now that doesn't seem like it's very
sensible because it seems like well i

442
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
sensible because it seems like well i
 

443
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,469
sensible because it seems like well i
want to incapacitate the other guy so

444
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
want to incapacitate the other guy so
 

445
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,150
want to incapacitate the other guy so
hitting him in the head or in the throat

446
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
hitting him in the head or in the throat
 

447
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,230
hitting him in the head or in the throat
or in the core of the body or taking off

448
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
or in the core of the body or taking off
 

449
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,430
or in the core of the body or taking off
a shoulder or something that's going to

450
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
a shoulder or something that's going to
 

451
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,350
a shoulder or something that's going to
be a more effective shot the problem

452
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
be a more effective shot the problem
 

453
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,350
be a more effective shot the problem
with that is all of those shots always

454
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
with that is all of those shots always
 

455
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,790
with that is all of those shots always
endanger me

456
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
endanger me
 

457
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,270
endanger me
more so i'm in greater danger for doing

458
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
more so i'm in greater danger for doing
 

459
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,790
more so i'm in greater danger for doing
that so let me show you what i mean so

that so let me show you what i mean so
 

461
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,230
that so let me show you what i mean so
if i just pick a random angle so i

462
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
if i just pick a random angle so i
 

463
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,830
if i just pick a random angle so i
haven't really measured my angle out

464
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
haven't really measured my angle out
 

465
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,909
haven't really measured my angle out

owie you've destroyed my ability to hold
 

507
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,630
owie you've destroyed my ability to hold
my weapon once you've destroyed my

508
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
my weapon once you've destroyed my
 

509
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,630
my weapon once you've destroyed my
ability to hold my weapon can't hold a

510
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
ability to hold my weapon can't hold a
 

511
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,750
ability to hold my weapon can't hold a
weapon i can't attack you with the

512
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
weapon i can't attack you with the
 

513
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,070
weapon i can't attack you with the
weapon that's great even if he doesn't

514
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
weapon that's great even if he doesn't
 

515
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,149
weapon that's great even if he doesn't
manage to get through my hand enough to

516
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
manage to get through my hand enough to
 

517
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,829
manage to get through my hand enough to
make me stop holding it he'll get a

518
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
make me stop holding it he'll get a
 

519
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,190
make me stop holding it he'll get a
second shot and a third shot and a

520
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
second shot and a third shot and a
 

521
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,790
second shot and a third shot and a
fourth shot and eventually those are

522
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
fourth shot and eventually those are
 

523
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,389
fourth shot and eventually those are
going to add up so

524
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
going to add up so
 

525
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,230
going to add up so
very likely that his katana is going to

526
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
very likely that his katana is going to
 

527
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,750
very likely that his katana is going to
go right through my fingers and take out

528
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
go right through my fingers and take out
 

529
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,150
go right through my fingers and take out
my fingers on the first sweep because

530
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
my fingers on the first sweep because
 

531
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,310
my fingers on the first sweep because
that's a fast moving powerful blade and

532
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
that's a fast moving powerful blade and
 

533
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,829
that's a fast moving powerful blade and
these guys are little and easy to get

534
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
these guys are little and easy to get
 

535
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,110
these guys are little and easy to get
through and all he's got to do really is

536
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
through and all he's got to do really is
 

537
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,630
through and all he's got to do really is
take out these two fingers and my

538
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
take out these two fingers and my
 

539
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
take out these two fingers and my
ability to use my sword is going to be

540
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
ability to use my sword is going to be
 

541
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,910
ability to use my sword is going to be
just about zero even if i'm a tough

542
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
just about zero even if i'm a tough
 

543
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,310
just about zero even if i'm a tough
tough guy right so so i really really

544
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
tough guy right so so i really really
 

545
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,550
tough guy right so so i really really
need all five of these working ideally

546
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
need all five of these working ideally
 

547
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,070
need all five of these working ideally
but this one's real bad this one's real

548
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
but this one's real bad this one's real
 

549
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
but this one's real bad this one's real
bad if i lose these of course i can't

550
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
bad if i lose these of course i can't
 

551
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,070
bad if i lose these of course i can't
hold my sword anymore so

552
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
hold my sword anymore so
 

553
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,670
hold my sword anymore so
that's what what we're looking at when

554
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
that's what what we're looking at when
 

555
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,670
that's what what we're looking at when
we're looking at attacks is we always

556
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
we're looking at attacks is we always
 

557
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,710
we're looking at attacks is we always
want to

558
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
want to
 

559
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,630
want to
attack the most available target and

560
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
attack the most available target and
 

561
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,750
attack the most available target and
that's generally going to be the hands

562
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
that's generally going to be the hands
 

563
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,509
that's generally going to be the hands
so hand attacks are generally better

564
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
so hand attacks are generally better
 

565
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,110
so hand attacks are generally better
attacks than body attacks there's all

566
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
attacks than body attacks there's all
 

567
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,630
attacks than body attacks there's all
kinds of situations where we can skew

568
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
kinds of situations where we can skew
 

569
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,389
kinds of situations where we can skew
that we get into advanced swordsmanship

570
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
that we get into advanced swordsmanship
 

571
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,990
that we get into advanced swordsmanship
we'll talk about why those are and then

572
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
we'll talk about why those are and then
 

573
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,190
we'll talk about why those are and then
the little things we can play with which

574
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
the little things we can play with which
 

575
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,030
the little things we can play with which
are great but in general that's that's a

576
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
are great but in general that's that's a
 

577
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,350
are great but in general that's that's a
good rule so understand high line

578
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
good rule so understand high line
 

579
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,509
good rule so understand high line
attacks are better than low line attacks

580
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
attacks are better than low line attacks
 

581
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,590
attacks are better than low line attacks
and attacks to the nearest target which

582
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
and attacks to the nearest target which
 

583
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,350
and attacks to the nearest target which
is generally the hands are the best

584
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
is generally the hands are the best
 

585
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,630
is generally the hands are the best
attacks you can make and it's because it

586
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
attacks you can make and it's because it
 

587
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,470
attacks you can make and it's because it
preserves you the best in both of those

588
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
preserves you the best in both of those
 

589
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,790
preserves you the best in both of those
situations actually okay one more thing

590
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
situations actually okay one more thing
 

591
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,590
situations actually okay one more thing
we need to talk about is the strength of

592
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
we need to talk about is the strength of
 

593
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,350
we need to talk about is the strength of
the lever so if josh just holds his

594
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
the lever so if josh just holds his
 

595
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,750
the lever so if josh just holds his
sword out here for me

596
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
sword out here for me
 

597
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,350
sword out here for me
this is a lever right

598
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
this is a lever right
 

599
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,190
this is a lever right
because it's a stick he's holding so the

600
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
because it's a stick he's holding so the
 

601
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,030
because it's a stick he's holding so the
way our universe works that makes this a

602
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
way our universe works that makes this a
 

603
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,870
way our universe works that makes this a
lever he has right now now the lever has

604
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
lever he has right now now the lever has
 

605
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,430
lever he has right now now the lever has
advantages and disadvantages right one

606
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
advantages and disadvantages right one
 

607
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,030
advantages and disadvantages right one
of the disadvantages one of the

608
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
of the disadvantages one of the
 

609
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,630
of the disadvantages one of the
advantages is that this end will move

610
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
advantages is that this end will move
 

611
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,630
advantages is that this end will move
really fast now which gives it a lot of

612
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
really fast now which gives it a lot of
 

613
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,310
really fast now which gives it a lot of
power to cut through stuff and that's an

614
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
power to cut through stuff and that's an
 

615
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,670
power to cut through stuff and that's an
advantage we definitely want from this

616
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
advantage we definitely want from this
 

617
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,310
advantage we definitely want from this
lever but the trade-off is this has less

618
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
lever but the trade-off is this has less
 

619
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,870
lever but the trade-off is this has less
strength than this now this moves much

620
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
strength than this now this moves much
 

621
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,350
strength than this now this moves much
slower but has more strength now i'm

622
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
slower but has more strength now i'm
 

623
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,630
slower but has more strength now i'm
going to ask josh to be as strong as he

624
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
going to ask josh to be as strong as he

us how strong the comparison is but you
 

693
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,110
us how strong the comparison is but you
don't need to get into all that just

694
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
don't need to get into all that just
 

695
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,710
don't need to get into all that just
understand that this is the weakest

696
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
understand that this is the weakest
 

697
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,150
understand that this is the weakest
point it can be moved off the line the

698
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
point it can be moved off the line the
 

699
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,150
point it can be moved off the line the
easiest and this is the strongest point

700
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
easiest and this is the strongest point
 

701
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,230
easiest and this is the strongest point
it can be moved off the least easily at

702
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
it can be moved off the least easily at

so understanding where the strong part

706
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
so understanding where the strong part
 

707
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,630
so understanding where the strong part
of the sword and the weak part of the

708
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
of the sword and the weak part of the
 

709
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,910
of the sword and the weak part of the
sword is is really important to

about that even though physically you
 

755
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,350

can
 

757
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,350
