00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
this body okay and the technique what
 

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,430
this body okay and the technique what
you're going to do

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
you're going to do
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,230
you're going to do
is go from this point of connection

10
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
is go from this point of connection
 

11
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,870
is go from this point of connection
to two points of connection right here

12
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
to two points of connection right here
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,830
to two points of connection right here
you see and now and now this is his body

14
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
you see and now and now this is his body
 

15
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,550
you see and now and now this is his body
this is inspired

16
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
this is inspired

this is inspired
this is not

this is not
 

19
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,830
this is not
the wwf that you're thinking

20
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
the wwf that you're thinking
 

21
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,509
the wwf that you're thinking
okay uh

22
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
okay uh
 

23
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,270
okay uh
because he can turn in on you

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280

 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,790

you go like this

26
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
you go like this
 

27
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,190
you go like this
and he turns in on you you see

28
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
and he turns in on you you see
 

29
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,869
and he turns in on you you see
you don't want people turning in on you

30
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
you don't want people turning in on you
 

31
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,790
you don't want people turning in on you
you don't give a if he gets to do

32
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
you don't give a if he gets to do
 

33
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,350
you don't give a if he gets to do
his chancey high break fall don't let

34
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
his chancey high break fall don't let
 

35
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,430
his chancey high break fall don't let
him do his fancy my breakfall do you

36
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
him do his fancy my breakfall do you
 

37
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,950
him do his fancy my breakfall do you
understand

38
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
understand
 

39
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,389
understand
toward that end

40
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
toward that end
 

41
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,830
toward that end
let me show you going in the back

42
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
let me show you going in the back
 

43
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,670
let me show you going in the back
because if you're in front he's gonna be

44
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
because if you're in front he's gonna be
 

45
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,910
because if you're in front he's gonna be
able to turn in

46
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
able to turn in
 

47
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,910
able to turn in
so get in the back stay in the back

48
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
so get in the back stay in the back
 

49
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,750
so get in the back stay in the back
two points to contact right here

50
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
two points to contact right here
 

51
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,990
two points to contact right here
and then step inside whatever turn he

52
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
and then step inside whatever turn he
 

53
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,469
and then step inside whatever turn he
wants to do you see how he did that

54
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
wants to do you see how he did that
 

55
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,270
wants to do you see how he did that
so

56
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
so
 

57
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:25,749
so
this is not it

58
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759

 

59
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,510

puts a triangle

60
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520

 

61
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,069

right into his base okay

62
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
right into his base okay
 

63
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,910
right into his base okay
so

64
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
so
 

65
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,270
so
let's just work on the transition to

66
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
let's just work on the transition to
 

67
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,190
let's just work on the transition to
the two points of concept so

68
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200

 

69
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,350

don't worry about the adv right

70
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
don't worry about the adv right
 

71
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:57,190
don't worry about the adv right
oh

72
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200

 

73
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,550

here i was

74
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
here i was
 

75
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,469
here i was
let go you see

76
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
let go you see
 

77
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,469
let go you see
and i use that energy

78
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479

 

79
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,910

you see that

80
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
you see that
 

81
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,990
you see that
you don't need the hand to fall head

82
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
you don't need the hand to fall head
 

83
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,309
you don't need the hand to fall head
pull the hand you're gonna help him turn

84
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
pull the hand you're gonna help him turn
 

85
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,589
pull the hand you're gonna help him turn
okay

86
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
okay
 

87
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,589
okay
try it again okay so what are you

88
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
try it again okay so what are you
 

89
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,150
try it again okay so what are you
looking for once you touch what am i

90
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
looking for once you touch what am i
 

91
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,070
looking for once you touch what am i
doing in the reconciliation what's my

92
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
doing in the reconciliation what's my
 

93
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,309
doing in the reconciliation what's my
aim my tactical aim there

94
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
aim my tactical aim there
 

95
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,270
aim my tactical aim there
what am i trying to get

96
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
what am i trying to get
 

97
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,869
what am i trying to get
the body law you're trying to get the

98
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
the body law you're trying to get the
 

99
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,070
the body law you're trying to get the
body lock

100
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
body lock
 

101
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,949
body lock
okay

102
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
okay
 

103
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,910
okay
so the body lock is that i'm going to

104
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
so the body lock is that i'm going to
 

105
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,030
so the body lock is that i'm going to
tip him

106
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
tip him
 

107
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,430
tip him
and then spin him

108
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
and then spin him
 

109
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,910
and then spin him
and then have him traverse the sagittal

110
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
and then have him traverse the sagittal
 

111
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,270
and then have him traverse the sagittal

got it then you add the stance i'm going

114
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
got it then you add the stance i'm going
 

115
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,589
got it then you add the stance i'm going
to make his space

116
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
to make his space
 

117
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,710
to make his space
do that

118
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
do that
 

119
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,830
do that
in a contrary direction okay we're not

120
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
in a contrary direction okay we're not
 

121
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,990
in a contrary direction okay we're not
dealing with the base i just want you to

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
dealing with the base i just want you to
 

123
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,150
dealing with the base i just want you to
see the body lock what we're not doing

124
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
see the body lock what we're not doing
 

125
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,229

00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
is you'll try to bend backwards
 

137
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,270
is you'll try to bend backwards
when someone has the body lock on you
