exercises so for
 

174
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,189
exercises so for
example in drill two where you're

175
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
example in drill two where you're
 

176
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,550
example in drill two where you're
standing in place you're grounding ukas

177
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,560
standing in place you're grounding ukas
 

178
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,749
standing in place you're grounding ukas
and energy on the back

179
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
and energy on the back
 

180
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,430
and energy on the back
foot but you can do that right our

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
foot but you can do that right our
 

182
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,230
foot but you can do that right our
metric for you doing that or not is only

183
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,240
metric for you doing that or not is only
 

184
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,670
metric for you doing that or not is only
did you get pushed over or not did you

185
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
did you get pushed over or not did you
 

186
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,029
did you get pushed over or not did you
feel muscle tension in you or not do you

187
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:46,039
feel muscle tension in you or not do you
 

188
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,749
feel muscle tension in you or not do you
see now some muscle tension is visible

189
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
see now some muscle tension is visible
 

190
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,029
see now some muscle tension is visible
that's

191
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:51,039
that's
 

192
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,629
that's
obvious and the teacher can spot

193
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
obvious and the teacher can spot
 

194
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,830
obvious and the teacher can spot
that but other muscle tension like your

195
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
that but other muscle tension like your
 

196
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,469
that but other muscle tension like your
bicep right your bicep getting tired or

197
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:01,479
bicep right your bicep getting tired or
 

198
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,469
bicep right your bicep getting tired or
even your mental tension you running a

199
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
even your mental tension you running a
 

200
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,029
even your mental tension you running a
bunch of thoughts in your

201
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
bunch of thoughts in your
 

202
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,710
bunch of thoughts in your
head that is not so visible to the

203
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:11,720
head that is not so visible to the
 

204
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,590
head that is not so visible to the
teacher and it's easily deniable by

205
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
teacher and it's easily deniable by
 

206
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,590
teacher and it's easily deniable by
you so we go to the next

207
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
you so we go to the next
 

208
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,270
you so we go to the next
exercise and the next exercise and

209
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
exercise and the next exercise and
 

210
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,309
exercise and the next exercise and
eventually we're on

211
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:23,319
eventually we're on
 

212
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,629
eventually we're on
exercise seven where you don't have a

213
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
exercise seven where you don't have a
 

214
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,909
exercise seven where you don't have a
back foot your feet are side by side

215
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
back foot your feet are side by side
 

216
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,590
back foot your feet are side by side
if you were grounding it doesn't matter

217
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
if you were grounding it doesn't matter
 

218
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,830
if you were grounding it doesn't matter
that your feet are side by side if the

219
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
that your feet are side by side if the
 

220
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,390
that your feet are side by side if the
Yami was being internalized and Vector

221
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
Yami was being internalized and Vector
 

222
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,350
Yami was being internalized and Vector
down you don't need a back

223
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
down you don't need a back
 

224
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,230
down you don't need a back
foot in fact you don't even need

225
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
foot in fact you don't even need
 

226
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,670
foot in fact you don't even need
midfoot which eventually we will get

227
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680

 

228
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,309

to but if you were doing it wrong all

229
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:52,319
to but if you were doing it wrong all
 

230
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,830
to but if you were doing it wrong all
the way up to seven you can't do seven

231
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
the way up to seven you can't do seven
 

232
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,110
the way up to seven you can't do seven
you just can't those are confirmation

233
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,120
you just can't those are confirmation
 

234
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,590
you just can't those are confirmation
exercises

235
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,600
exercises
 

236
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,350
exercises
and when you can't do seven we realize

237
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
and when you can't do seven we realize
 

238
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,469
and when you can't do seven we realize
you weren't doing drill one you weren't

239
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:05,479
you weren't doing drill one you weren't
 

240
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:13,749
you weren't doing drill one you weren't
doing drill two and so on and so on

241
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759

 

242
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,710

so reason works like

243
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
so reason works like
 

244
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,909
so reason works like
that but it has the underlying

245
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:20,919
that but it has the underlying
 

246
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,710
that but it has the underlying
assumption not doing it here not doing

247
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:23,720
assumption not doing it here not doing
 

248
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,230
assumption not doing it here not doing
it there that this is how the old

249
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,240
it there that this is how the old
 

250
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,150
it there that this is how the old
ancients used reason

251
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160

 

252
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,110

if you look at what Sigman was

253
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
if you look at what Sigman was
 

254
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,749
if you look at what Sigman was
saying he's going to do the boat rowing

255
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
saying he's going to do the boat rowing
 

256
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,550
saying he's going to do the boat rowing
exercise and he is going to use a bag

257
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:43,560
exercise and he is going to use a bag
 

258
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,629
exercise and he is going to use a bag
you see he's going to do a bag to get a

259
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:47,639
you see he's going to do a bag to get a
 

260
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,830
you see he's going to do a bag to get a
sense of it why because doing it in the

261
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:50,840
sense of it why because doing it in the
 

262
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,189
sense of it why because doing it in the
air it's just too easy to

263
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199

 

264
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,990

 the bag is really no different

265
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
the bag is really no different
 

266
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,950
the bag is really no different
from drills

267
00:06:59,950 --> 00:06:59,960
from drills
 

268
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,790
from drills
what do we have there three probably

269
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
what do we have there three probably
 

270
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,309
what do we have there three probably
three four five UK is the

271
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:07,319
three four five UK is the
 

272
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,189
three four five UK is the
bag but we go one further with six and

273
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
bag but we go one further with six and
 

274
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,189
bag but we go one further with six and
seven and take away the backf foot

275
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
seven and take away the backf foot
 

276
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,309
seven and take away the backf foot
entirely okay those are confirmation

277
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
entirely okay those are confirmation
 

278
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,309
entirely okay those are confirmation
exercises why do you need them because

279
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
exercises why do you need them because
 

280
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,350
exercises why do you need them because
we'll

281
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360

 

282
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,270

ourselves it's interesting I I there was

283
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,280
ourselves it's interesting I I there was
 

284
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,029
ourselves it's interesting I I there was
a recent podcast I'll share it

285
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039

 

286
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,749

um but I think it was uh Adam meisner's

292
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,749

exercises and why because I would say

exercises and why because I would say
 

294
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,430
exercises and why because I would say
it's because of this so even here we do

295
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
it's because of this so even here we do
 

296
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,189
it's because of this so even here we do
have drill one standing I tell you to do

okay that's what's going on

311
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:14,199

 

312
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,029

there we're going to do Zen it's not a

same in then you have mudra

1020
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:00,679
same in then you have mudra
 

1021
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:03,630

work which is proof positive that it's
 

1023
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,350
work which is proof positive that it's
not a therapeutic mental thing that it

1024

not a therapeutic mental thing that it
 

1025
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,190
not a therapeutic mental thing that it
is energy work otherwise no need for

1026
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,200
is energy work otherwise no need for
 

1027
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,190
is energy work otherwise no need for

Kona they work off each other so you you

1096
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,120
Kona they work off each other so you you
 

1097
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,070
Kona they work off each other so you you
can't just work

your hands your I key without poke you
 

1101
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,590
your hands your I key without poke you
and so they feed each other and so you

1102
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:10,600
and so they feed each other and so you
 

1103
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,870
and so they feed each other and so you
should feel the

1104
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:11,880
should feel the

so it's not that I

1114
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:31,639
so it's not that I
 

1115
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,029
so it's not that I
am keeping the

1121
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,269
work I'm rebounding the energy into my
hands and that shape is kept okay so if

1122
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
hands and that shape is kept okay so if
 

1123
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,430
hands and that shape is kept okay so if
I'm doing this stuff and it gets weak do

I'm doing this stuff and it gets weak do
you see that which often happens I'm not

1126
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,200
you see that which often happens I'm not
 

1127
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,269
you see that which often happens I'm not
doing the internal work I'm probably

1128
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:54,279
doing the internal work I'm probably
 

1129
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,070
doing the internal work I'm probably
just

1130
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,080
just
 

1131
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,710
just
relaxing okay what if I'm here like this

skill level because my what I'm doing
 

1767
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,270
skill level because my what I'm doing
here is the energetic aspect of release

1768
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
here is the energetic aspect of release
 

1769
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,109
here is the energetic aspect of release
okay because release is a skill if I

1770

failing right away and all it's
 

1781
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,589
failing right away and all it's
producing is self- reification and self

1782
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
producing is self- reification and self

okay um too many times we think it's a

1810
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
okay um too many times we think it's a
 

1811
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,470
okay um too many times we think it's a
psychological thing and hence we could

1812
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:38,480
psychological thing and hence we could
 

1813
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,230
psychological thing and hence we could
think about non- contestation you see or

1814

think about non- contestation you see or
 

1815
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,069
think about non- contestation you see or
we could think about

1816
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:45,079
we could think about
 

1817
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:47,470
we could think about
self-release and feel that we're going

1818
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:47,480
self-release and feel that we're going
 

1819
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,510
self-release and feel that we're going
to be able to do it in the world right

1949
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,190
of you holding me I match the Palm okay
so you you even lightened it a little

1950

1954
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
into it to get that equal uh uh y value
 

1955
