00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,050
Hello everyone

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,218
my name is Guillaume Erard

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:13,305
I'm the Media Manager and Archiving Director for the IAF

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,515
I'm in Tokyo Station

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,100
and I'm going to meet Irie Yoshinobu Shihan

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,686
We're going to board the Joetsu line of the Shinkansen

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,524
which should take us in a little less than an hour to the city of Takasaki.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,653
Takasaki is the city that will be hosting the next IAF Congress.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,385
in September 2016.

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,699
They're currently building a brand new sports facility

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,785
and we'll be the first ones to use it

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,578
which is pretty exciting.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,663
Now, that being said,

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,791
I'm pretty sure that many of you had never heard of Takasaki before

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,002
and basically, what Irie Sensei and I are going to do today,

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,172
is that we're going to find out what the city is about,

17
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,425
see how the construction work is going,

18
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,053
and also, try to find out what sort of activities

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,056
that attendees can take part in between classes.

20
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,599
I hope that you like what you see,

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,685
and we'll be looking forward to see you in Takasaki.
