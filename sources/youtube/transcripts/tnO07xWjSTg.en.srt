whatever it's just ever so slightly he
 

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,310
whatever it's just ever so slightly he
has like a a down there's more pressure

has like a a down there's more pressure
 

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,510
has like a a down there's more pressure
on this hand and there's a in okay so I

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,520
on this hand and there's a in okay so I
 

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,030
on this hand and there's a in okay so I
reconcile that

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
reconcile that
 

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,749
reconcile that
one and do that again okay so ever so

22
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:12,759
one and do that again okay so ever so
 

23
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,950
one and do that again okay so ever so
slightly I felt a down there's a

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:15,960
slightly I felt a down there's a
 

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,870
slightly I felt a down there's a
downward to it and there's an inwardness

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
downward to it and there's an inwardness
 

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,870
downward to it and there's an inwardness
to it and there was more pressure on

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
to it and there was more pressure on
 

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,830
to it and there was more pressure on
this hand okay so you see that I

30
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
this hand okay so you see that I
 

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,630
this hand okay so you see that I
yielding to

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
yielding to
 

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,710
yielding to
that he he's he's pushing me this way

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
that he he's he's pushing me this way
 

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,469
that he he's he's pushing me this way
cuz that hand coming this way so that's

36
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
cuz that hand coming this way so that's
 

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,870
cuz that hand coming this way so that's
why he goes that way you see he pushed

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
why he goes that way you see he pushed

that last M where that one worked you
 

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,270
that last M where that one worked you
see cuz you just have this move where

got here and now here's where I open up
yield one way project if I need to take

136
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:01,079
yield one way project if I need to take
 

137
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,350
yield one way project if I need to take
some Mass off of him

138

some Mass off of him
 

139
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,390
some Mass off of him
okay it's just even if it's slight

00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:13,879
don't move but I felt the tension I
 

147
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,430
don't move but I felt the tension I
don't want that okay or I felt my weight

148

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
that
 

153
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,150
that
happens yield at the end except at the

154
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
happens yield at the end except at the
 

155
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,189
happens yield at the end except at the
end even there but if you move away from

156
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:28,199
end even there but if you move away from
 

157
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,430
end even there but if you move away from
choreography and you're just just in a

158
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,440
choreography and you're just just in a
 

159
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,390
choreography and you're just just in a
relationship with

160
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,400
relationship with
 

161
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,950
relationship with
him it'll

162
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960

 

163
00:04:40,960 --> 00:05:07,830

work okay try it

164
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840

 

165
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,430

all right the the training is kind of

counterintuitive for B in that you're
 

169
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,830
counterintuitive for B in that you're
like goal oriented so you're like I

like goal oriented so you're like I
 

171
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,990
like goal oriented so you're like I
moved

172
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,000
moved
 

173
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,670
moved
him I moved him that that's not it the

training is skill development so uh

176
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
training is skill development so uh
 

177
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,230
training is skill development so uh
parameters are set yes move him but it's

178
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
parameters are set yes move him but it's
 

179
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,350
parameters are set yes move him but it's
how you're moving him okay and how is

180
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
how you're moving him okay and how is
 

181
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,510
how you're moving him okay and how is
determined by certain metrics that you

182

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,189
have so one of them is midfoot I
mentioned that in the last break so if I

186
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
mentioned that in the last break so if I
 

187
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,110
mentioned that in the last break so if I
felt heel weight you see even if I was

188
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,120
felt heel weight you see even if I was
 

189
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,950
felt heel weight you see even if I was
able to move him I would go no that's

190
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
able to move him I would go no that's
 

191
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,230
able to move him I would go no that's
not correct okay another one is your

251
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,830

um let's try to try to remember

252
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:26,840
um let's try to try to remember
 

253
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,670
um let's try to try to remember
this the arm arm is very very difficult

254
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
this the arm arm is very very difficult
 

255
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,909
this the arm arm is very very difficult
it happens but it's so low

256
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:34,919
it happens but it's so low
 

257
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,709
it happens but it's so low
percentage

258
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
percentage
 

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,149
percentage
um and it's

260
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:39,159
um and it's
 

261
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,149
um and it's
why when we deconstruct the posture

262
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
why when we deconstruct the posture
 

263
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,509
why when we deconstruct the posture
that's why my projection line is through

264
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:44,519
that's why my projection line is through
 

265
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,350
that's why my projection line is through
the center not not on the arms not in

507
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,670
it okay so uh a lot of you are having
this hand come down like your your yield

508
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:20,680
this hand come down like your your yield
 

509
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,189
this hand come down like your your yield
hand so you go here and then then you're

510
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199

 

511
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,470

projecting this hand doesn't just go

512
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,480
projecting this hand doesn't just go
 

513
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,590
projecting this hand doesn't just go
here this hand sticks so he could go the

514
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
here this hand sticks so he could go the
 

515
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,790
here this hand sticks so he could go the
other way you see it it has to stick has

516
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:39,800
other way you see it it has to stick has
 

517
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,990
other way you see it it has to stick has
to move

518
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,000

 

519
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,910

him you guys thought that and so a lot

520
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
him you guys thought that and so a lot
 

521
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,350
him you guys thought that and so a lot
of times it's going dead because you're

522
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,360
of times it's going dead because you're
 

523
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,949
of times it's going dead because you're
like got you you you come here on

524
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
like got you you you come here on
 

525
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,710
like got you you you come here on
the projection line but it's dead okay

526
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:53,720
the projection line but it's dead okay
 

527
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,670
the projection line but it's dead okay
and instead this is if we go back to my

528
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:56,680
and instead this is if we go back to my
 

529
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,710
and instead this is if we go back to my
what I eventually start doing

530
00:16:59,710 --> 00:16:59,720
what I eventually start doing
 

531
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,789
what I eventually start doing
I'm here you see and it's stick sticking

532
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:03,799
I'm here you see and it's stick sticking
 

533
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm here you see and it's stick sticking
sticking okay so if you don't if you

534
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,240
sticking okay so if you don't if you
 

535
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,789
sticking okay so if you don't if you
leave it in the grip it still has to do

536
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:09,799
leave it in the grip it still has to do
 

537
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,029
leave it in the grip it still has to do
it it still has to do it so even though

538
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:14,039
it it still has to do it so even though
 

539
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,150
it it still has to do it so even though
it looks like it's here it's it's

540
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
it looks like it's here it's it's
 

541
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,309
it looks like it's here it's it's
not it's sticking inside no different

542
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
not it's sticking inside no different
 

543
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,270
not it's sticking inside no different
than if you're if you're out here and

544
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,280
than if you're if you're out here and
 

545
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,230
than if you're if you're out here and
you're

546
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,240
you're
 

547
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,549
you're
sticking sticking or no different on the

548
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
sticking sticking or no different on the
 

549
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,270
sticking sticking or no different on the
project ection hand the projection hand

550
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
project ection hand the projection hand
 

551
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,990
project ection hand the projection hand
can't go through it has to stick so that

552
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,000
can't go through it has to stick so that
 

553
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,870
can't go through it has to stick so that
it has the projection

554
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:37,880
it has the projection
 

555
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,510
it has the projection
point so obviously in the yinong world

556
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
point so obviously in the yinong world
 

557
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,230
point so obviously in the yinong world
there's going to be some I in the C you

558
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,240
there's going to be some I in the C you
 

559
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,029
there's going to be some I in the C you
see that and in the in the yield in the

560
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:48,039
see that and in the in the yield in the
 

561
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,390
see that and in the in the yield in the
external yield there has to be an

562
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
external yield there has to be an
 

563
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,590
external yield there has to be an
internal aspect too so even though

564
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
internal aspect too so even though
 

565
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,390
internal aspect too so even though
you're

566
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400

 

567
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,350

dropping and then the more you have

568
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
dropping and then the more you have
 

569
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,270
dropping and then the more you have
that you don't have to make the big

570
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,280

 

571
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,190

yelds so I'm going to show you what I'm

572
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
yelds so I'm going to show you what I'm
 

573
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,789
yelds so I'm going to show you what I'm
did as I'm here and I stick there it is

574
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
did as I'm here and I stick there it is
 

575
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,750
did as I'm here and I stick there it is
and I turn that was it there's the Tilt

576
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:16,760
and I turn that was it there's the Tilt
 

577
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,710
and I turn that was it there's the Tilt
okay here's that rotating axle in the

578
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
okay here's that rotating axle in the
 

579
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,510
okay here's that rotating axle in the
spiral and keep thean and here's the

580
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:24,520
spiral and keep thean and here's the
 

581
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,190
spiral and keep thean and here's the
perpendicular projection line in the

582
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
perpendicular projection line in the
 

583
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,110
perpendicular projection line in the
center you guys see that so you're just

584
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,120
center you guys see that so you're just
 

585
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,390
center you guys see that so you're just
here and

586
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
here and
 

587
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,750
here and
just okay but it's all because even

588
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:36,760
just okay but it's all because even
 

589
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,110
just okay but it's all because even
though my arm is moving externally

590
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
though my arm is moving externally
 

591
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,270
though my arm is moving externally
through space inside the grip I don't

592
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,280
through space inside the grip I don't
 

593
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,430
through space inside the grip I don't
move it irrelevant of these internal

594
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
move it irrelevant of these internal
 

595
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:55,490
move it irrelevant of these internal
aspects okay all right try
