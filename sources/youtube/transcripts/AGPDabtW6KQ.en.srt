so in this clip Raj comes for a thrust

150
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,160
so in this clip Raj comes for a thrust
 

151
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,740
so in this clip Raj comes for a thrust
and I count it with a strike to his head

so I rarely use these strikes with foam

160
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:38,960
so I rarely use these strikes with foam
 

161
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,900
so I rarely use these strikes with foam
in this exchange I open up and try and

in this exchange I open up and try and
 

163
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,880
in this exchange I open up and try and
bait Raj to attack which he does with a
