170
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
see I can't tap his hand why would he
 

171
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,990

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,350
if he now does the ski
ski

176
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360

 

177
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,649

that's so so Roku can be done from skis

178
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:03,659
that's so so Roku can be done from skis
 

179
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,990
that's so so Roku can be done from skis
because they're turning

180
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
because they're turning
 

181
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,050
because they're turning
their hand usually

their hand usually
 

183
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,809
their hand usually
so I just I was thinking about this and

184
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:11,819
so I just I was thinking about this and
 

185
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,789
so I just I was thinking about this and
I thought well a lot of people don't get

186
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:13,799
I thought well a lot of people don't get
 

187
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,949
I thought well a lot of people don't get
that but if they start to learn the

188
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:15,959
that but if they start to learn the
 

189
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,550
that but if they start to learn the
angle they can actually see how

190
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
angle they can actually see how
 

191
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,990
angle they can actually see how

00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,350
so what is this what is this technique
what is this technique

196
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,360
what is this technique
 

197
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,450
what is this technique
Nick yeah
