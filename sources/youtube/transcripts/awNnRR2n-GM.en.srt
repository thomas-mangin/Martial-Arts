1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,310

all right so something to remember in

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:07,320
all right so something to remember in
 

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,669
all right so something to remember in
in um he has to pass through

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
in um he has to pass through
 

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,870
in um he has to pass through
Kad okay so when he comes down here and

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:15,880
Kad okay so when he comes down here and
 

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,349
Kad okay so when he comes down here and
stops go back one step he we are in

8
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359
stops go back one step he we are in
 

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,070
stops go back one step he we are in
K okay then he cuts down and he goes

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
K okay then he cuts down and he goes
 

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,790
K okay then he cuts down and he goes
around so any koshinaga you can do from

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
around so any koshinaga you can do from
 

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,830
around so any koshinaga you can do from
you can do from the beginning

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:34,840

 

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,790

of okay that's very much like for

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
of okay that's very much like for
 

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,549
of okay that's very much like for
example he comes for

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:41,559
example he comes for
 

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,350
example he comes for
k

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,360
k
 

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,910
k
See until he grabs it's

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
See until he grabs it's
 

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,510
See until he grabs it's
ski okay so for

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
ski okay so for
 

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,270
ski okay so for
example he grabs you probably have kot

26
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
example he grabs you probably have kot
 

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,189
example he grabs you probably have kot
from

28
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:56,199
from
 

29
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:03,110
from
Kat this is a dumb technique okay

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120

 

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,630

that's better to just treat it as

32
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
that's better to just treat it as
 

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,630
that's better to just treat it as
steep you'll have so

34
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
steep you'll have so
 

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,310
steep you'll have so
likewise you just have to reconcile this

36
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
likewise you just have to reconcile this
 

37
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,030
likewise you just have to reconcile this
part

38
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040

 

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,910

here okay so how do you do that I'm

40
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
here okay so how do you do that I'm
 

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,350
here okay so how do you do that I'm
going to fade and then come up and

42
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
going to fade and then come up and
 

43
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,830
going to fade and then come up and
inside his

44
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840

 

45
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,149

Circle take for an inside his

46
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:35,159

 

47
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,230

CC if he cuts it down you got to have to

48
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
CC if he cuts it down you got to have to
 

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,149
CC if he cuts it down you got to have to
fade more cuz you're going to

50
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
fade more cuz you're going to
 

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,990
fade more cuz you're going to
get

52
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,000
get
 

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,870
get
resistance so you fade Bo then it comes

54
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:45,880
resistance so you fade Bo then it comes
 

55
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,749
resistance so you fade Bo then it comes
back

56
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759

 

57
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,830

up fade home

58
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840

 

59
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:09,109

back

60
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119

 

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,430

okay let's

62
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
okay let's
 

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,750
okay let's
try all right the good thing about this

64
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
try all right the good thing about this
 

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,229
try all right the good thing about this
technique is that you're going to have

66
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
technique is that you're going to have
 

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,430
technique is that you're going to have
to learn and our camera can walk

68
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,440
to learn and our camera can walk
 

69
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,790
to learn and our camera can walk
wherever they need to

70
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800

 

71
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,830

go you are going to have to learn the be

72
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
go you are going to have to learn the be
 

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,309
go you are going to have to learn the be
to not do the beginner mistake where

74
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
to not do the beginner mistake where
 

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,030
to not do the beginner mistake where
your hips are parallel to

76
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
your hips are parallel to
 

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,150
your hips are parallel to
theirs your hips have to turn all the

78
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
theirs your hips have to turn all the
 

79
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,150
theirs your hips have to turn all the
way around

80
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
way around
 

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,589
way around
okay and if you look

82
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
okay and if you look
 

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,630
okay and if you look
up when he makes contact with that

84
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
up when he makes contact with that
 

85
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,430
up when he makes contact with that
pressure so that this hip is higher than

86
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
pressure so that this hip is higher than
 

87
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,030
pressure so that this hip is higher than
the other hip when I roll when he hits

88
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
the other hip when I roll when he hits
 

89
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,670
the other hip when I roll when he hits
me I can use the adhesion to get him up

90
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
me I can use the adhesion to get him up
 

91
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,070
me I can use the adhesion to get him up
when I bring my head

92
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,080

 

93
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,470

sorry here you grab

94
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
sorry here you grab
 

95
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,110
sorry here you grab
okay so I'm looking

96
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
okay so I'm looking
 

97
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,270
okay so I'm looking
up and then as I roll I bring him around

98
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280

 

99
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,589

me okay A lot of times beginners will

100
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
me okay A lot of times beginners will
 

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,190
me okay A lot of times beginners will
go

102
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
go
 

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,670
go
parallel and they'll try to get him on

104
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
parallel and they'll try to get him on
 

105
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,190
parallel and they'll try to get him on
un parallel to him

106
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
un parallel to him
 

107
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,710
un parallel to him
or they are just

108
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720
or they are just
 

109
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,190
or they are just
across and hoping that he gets on as

110
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
across and hoping that he gets on as
 

111
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,110
across and hoping that he gets on as
opposed to to make contact here and as

112
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,120
opposed to to make contact here and as
 

113
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,910
opposed to to make contact here and as
he rolls is bring your hips around he

114
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
he rolls is bring your hips around he
 

115
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,910
he rolls is bring your hips around he
rolls onto it okay so as I do this

116
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
rolls onto it okay so as I do this
 

117
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,830
rolls onto it okay so as I do this
technique you can see that my hip is up

118
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:46,840
technique you can see that my hip is up
 

119
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,550
technique you can see that my hip is up
not

120
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
not
 

121
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,789
not
down stay there

122
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
down stay there
 

123
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,069
down stay there
okay one and I make contact

124
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,079
okay one and I make contact
 

125
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,670
okay one and I make contact
there not

126
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
there not
 

127
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,390
there not
here

128
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400

 

129
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,110

and then as I

130
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,120
and then as I
 

131
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:13,429
and then as I
move he just easy pey okay I'll do it

132
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439

 

133
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,670

again contact

134
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
again contact
 

135
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,949
again contact
here then I roll my

136
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
here then I roll my
 

137
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,430
here then I roll my
hips feel good okay let's try that t so

138
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,440
hips feel good okay let's try that t so
 

139
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,469
hips feel good okay let's try that t so
I think that's the main thing is like

140
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
I think that's the main thing is like
 

141
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,790
I think that's the main thing is like
make sure you're perpendicular to the to

142
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
make sure you're perpendicular to the to
 

143
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,150
make sure you're perpendicular to the to
the Koshi don't be parallel to the kushy

144
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,160
the Koshi don't be parallel to the kushy
 

145
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,270
the Koshi don't be parallel to the kushy
you were you were parallel to the kushy

146
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
you were you were parallel to the kushy
 

147
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,749
you were you were parallel to the kushy
in the in the problem that you had um

148
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:36,759
in the in the problem that you had um
 

149
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,909
in the in the problem that you had um
and then uh wherever you can you can't

150
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
and then uh wherever you can you can't
 

151
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,029
and then uh wherever you can you can't
always and you don't always need to is

152
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,039
always and you don't always need to is
 

153

make
 

155
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,230
make
contact make an adhesion and then as you

156
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
contact make an adhesion and then as you
 

157
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,550
contact make an adhesion and then as you
turn your hips that's what brings him up

158
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,560
turn your hips that's what brings him up
 

159
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,390
turn your hips that's what brings him up
okay not the fact that he's taller than

160
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
okay not the fact that he's taller than
 

161
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,150
okay not the fact that he's taller than
you or you're lower than him or there's

162
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
you or you're lower than him or there's
 

163
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,150

application I'm not going to stay there

174
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,360
application I'm not going to stay there
 

175
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,710
application I'm not going to stay there
and I think for me um those the we do

176
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
and I think for me um those the we do
 

177
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,390
and I think for me um those the we do
judo throws but if I'm doing a a iido

178
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,400
judo throws but if I'm doing a a iido
 

179
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,909
judo throws but if I'm doing a a iido
throw I don't stay underneath the person

180
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
throw I don't stay underneath the person
 

181
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,230
throw I don't stay underneath the person
okay so some if you like currently I'm

182
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
okay so some if you like currently I'm
 

183
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,870
okay so some if you like currently I'm
staying underneath him cuz I'm just

184
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
staying underneath him cuz I'm just
 

185
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,710
staying underneath him cuz I'm just
going to lower him I'm working on the

186
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:35,720
going to lower him I'm working on the
 

187
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,150
going to lower him I'm working on the
Koshi to Koshi angle okay um which is

188
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,160
Koshi to Koshi angle okay um which is
 

189
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,710
Koshi to Koshi angle okay um which is
what I think you should work on but the

190
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
what I think you should work on but the
 

191
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,029
what I think you should work on but the
there's a you have to be careful because

192
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
there's a you have to be careful because
 

193
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,110
there's a you have to be careful because
a lot of people will go like this with

194
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
a lot of people will go like this with
 

195
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,629
a lot of people will go like this with
this big steep stance okay and then they

196
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
this big steep stance okay and then they
 

197
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,110
this big steep stance okay and then they
go here and he's on that corner do you

198
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,120
go here and he's on that corner do you
 

199
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,749
go here and he's on that corner do you
feel that TR and I can kind of muscle

200
00:05:58,749 --> 00:05:58,759
feel that TR and I can kind of muscle
 

201
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,510
feel that TR and I can kind of muscle
him around

202
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520

 

203
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,830

it's not as clean to me as a technique

204
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
it's not as clean to me as a technique
 

205
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,469
it's not as clean to me as a technique
cuz you're so wide now as opposed to

206
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:07,479
cuz you're so wide now as opposed to
 

207
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,469
cuz you're so wide now as opposed to
you're here then I have to put my Koshi

208
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
you're here then I have to put my Koshi
 

209
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,950
you're here then I have to put my Koshi
in the right place but the better part

210
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
in the right place but the better part
 

211
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,189
in the right place but the better part
of this is that as I do the technique I

212
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,199
of this is that as I do the technique I
 

213
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,870
of this is that as I do the technique I
don't have to stay here so as I roll I'm

214
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:19,880
don't have to stay here so as I roll I'm
 

215
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,430
don't have to stay here so as I roll I'm
going to move out so that he falls more

216
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
going to move out so that he falls more
 

217
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,230
going to move out so that he falls more
vertical and there's less chance that he

218
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
vertical and there's less chance that he
 

219
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,830
vertical and there's less chance that he
can pull me into the residual

220
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:28,840
can pull me into the residual
 

221
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,510
can pull me into the residual
centrifugal energy and if you're wide

222
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
centrifugal energy and if you're wide
 

223
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,909
centrifugal energy and if you're wide
you can't step out but if you're in

224
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
you can't step out but if you're in
 

225
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,230
you can't step out but if you're in
shenti home you can and he will fall

226
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,240
shenti home you can and he will fall
 

227
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,350
shenti home you can and he will fall
more vertically less centrifugally you

228
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,360
more vertically less centrifugally you
 

229
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,469
more vertically less centrifugally you
can't counter you

230
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
can't counter you
 

231
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,430
can't counter you
okay

232
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:44,440
okay
 

233
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,629
okay
um we'll go on so as he comes around to

234
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
um we'll go on so as he comes around to
 

235
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,909
um we'll go on so as he comes around to
a Shido anywhere that you can get your

236
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
a Shido anywhere that you can get your
 

237
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,189
a Shido anywhere that you can get your
hips in that position you have the throw

238
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
hips in that position you have the throw
 

239
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,950
hips in that position you have the throw
now this is a much harder Emi so I'm

240
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
now this is a much harder Emi so I'm
 

241
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,189
now this is a much harder Emi so I'm
going to let go so and he can grab

242
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
going to let go so and he can grab
 

243
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,749
going to let go so and he can grab
whatever okay but you can see it's

244
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
whatever okay but you can see it's
 

245
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,430
whatever okay but you can see it's
exactly the same grabing with

246
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440

 

247
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,070

this I'm loading those hips he's coming

248
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
this I'm loading those hips he's coming
 

249
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,350
this I'm loading those hips he's coming
around boom and it's right there okay

250
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,360
around boom and it's right there okay
 

251
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,589
around boom and it's right there okay
and the same thing you can move under

252
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
and the same thing you can move under
 

253
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,070
and the same thing you can move under
him as you're doing

254
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080

 

255
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,110

this and

256
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120

 

257
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,390

because boom this way and you would pass

258
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
because boom this way and you would pass
 

259
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,070
because boom this way and you would pass
under

260
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
under
 

261
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:58,309
under
him

262
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

263
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:28,230

this

264
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240

 

265
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:48,470

okay

266
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480

 

267
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,470

so it's a kind of vicious fall because

268
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:51,480
so it's a kind of vicious fall because
 

269
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,829
so it's a kind of vicious fall because
he can't grab me unless I let him grab

270
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
he can't grab me unless I let him grab
 

271
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,269
he can't grab me unless I let him grab
me and then when you apply my version

272
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
me and then when you apply my version
 

273
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,350
me and then when you apply my version
where I'm going under him he's pretty

274
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
where I'm going under him he's pretty
 

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,990
where I'm going under him he's pretty
much Fallen 100% at that point okay so a

276
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,000
much Fallen 100% at that point okay so a
 

277
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,430
much Fallen 100% at that point okay so a
safe way to do the technique is going to

278
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
safe way to do the technique is going to
 

279
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,069
safe way to do the technique is going to
turn it into exactly the the first

280
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:08,079
turn it into exactly the the first
 

281
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,790
turn it into exactly the the first
technique that we did okay so I'll give

282
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:11,800
technique that we did okay so I'll give
 

283
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,990
technique that we did okay so I'll give
you reference points okay so he's going

284
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
you reference points okay so he's going
 

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,150
you reference points okay so he's going
to come

286
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
to come
 

287
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,110
to come
around all right and I go here and he's

288
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,120
around all right and I go here and he's
 

289
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,269
around all right and I go here and he's
going to let go of the outside hand and

290
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
going to let go of the outside hand and
 

291
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,110
going to let go of the outside hand and
now he grabs there okay and so you would

292
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
now he grabs there okay and so you would
 

293
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,470
now he grabs there okay and so you would
pass under him this hand will go here

294
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
pass under him this hand will go here
 

295
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,710
pass under him this hand will go here
and hit the legs as you do everything

296
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,720
and hit the legs as you do everything
 

297
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,670
and hit the legs as you do everything
okay so

298
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
okay so
 

299
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,710
okay so
boom you can hold them

300
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,720

 

301
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,190

up do that side

302
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,200
up do that side
 

303
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,790
up do that side
again long from here as I take his hand

304
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:45,800
again long from here as I take his hand
 

305
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,150
again long from here as I take his hand
he just goes follow it let me just go

306
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
he just goes follow it let me just go
 

307
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,910
he just goes follow it let me just go
over the top okay doesn't

308
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920

 

309
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,430

matter if you're more comfortable is you

310
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
matter if you're more comfortable is you
 

311
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,110
matter if you're more comfortable is you
go

312
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120

 

313
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,310

earlier to underneath doesn't matter

314
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320

 

315
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,640

okay okay try
