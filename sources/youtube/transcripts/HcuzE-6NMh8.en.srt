117
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,990

think of a motorbike throttle

118
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000

 

119
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,949

and block

120
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959

 

121
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,949

i think for motorbike throttle and block

122
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959

 

123
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,990

these are the stages but this is still

124
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000

part of the same number
 

127
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,430
part of the same number
of two so this is where it's confusing

128
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
of two so this is where it's confusing
 

129
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,789
of two so this is where it's confusing
because the carter

130
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
because the carter
 

131
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,589
because the carter
