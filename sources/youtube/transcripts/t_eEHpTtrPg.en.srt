00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,430
very
common like you don't understand the

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
common like you don't understand the
 

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,470
common like you don't understand the
angles that you're trying to do on the

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:11,480
angles that you're trying to do on the
 

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,990
angles that you're trying to do on the
body you just do some footwork it's not

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,000
body you just do some footwork it's not
 

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,790
body you just do some footwork it's not
really an angle change here if you pay

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
really an angle change here if you pay
 

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,950
really an angle change here if you pay
attention do you see what I mean like

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
attention do you see what I mean like
 

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,630
attention do you see what I mean like
you can still turn and hit me you see

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
you can still turn and hit me you see
 

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,790
you can still turn and hit me you see
what I'm trying to do is hide hide over

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
what I'm trying to do is hide hide over
 

17
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,630
what I'm trying to do is hide hide over
here you see your shoulder is way over

18
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
here you see your shoulder is way over
 

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,269
here you see your shoulder is way over
there you get it we go like this and

20
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
there you get it we go like this and
 

21
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,190
there you get it we go like this and
then look your shoulder is not way over

22
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,200
then look your shoulder is not way over
 

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,110
then look your shoulder is not way over
there so my my angle can be very small

24
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
there so my my angle can be very small
 

25
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,229
there so my my angle can be very small
can be very small I'm in it you see I

26
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:43,239
can be very small I'm in it you see I
 

27
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,510
can be very small I'm in it you see I
got in it again and maybe the camera

28
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
got in it again and maybe the camera
 

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,670
got in it again and maybe the camera
needs to go here and hid it

30
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,680

 

31
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,229

out it's not it's not in that you just

32
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:53,239
out it's not it's not in that you just
 

33
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,189
out it's not it's not in that you just
step out that way you're looking for

34
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
step out that way you're looking for
 

35
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,910
step out that way you're looking for
angles okay

36
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920

 

37
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,429

so likewise I need an angle for my entry

38
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
so likewise I need an angle for my entry
 

39
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,789
so likewise I need an angle for my entry
okay if I'm going to do a Mot I need a

40
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:11,799
okay if I'm going to do a Mot I need a
 

41
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,630
okay if I'm going to do a Mot I need a
particular opening for the entry if I'm

42
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
particular opening for the entry if I'm
 

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,030
particular opening for the entry if I'm
going to do Ura I need a different

44
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,040
going to do Ura I need a different
 

45
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,030
going to do Ura I need a different
opening so I can't do the same

46
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,040
opening so I can't do the same
 

47
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,270
opening so I can't do the same
shikaku over here I'm not going to get a

48
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
shikaku over here I'm not going to get a
 

49
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,310
shikaku over here I'm not going to get a
m this this elbow's way on that side

50
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
m this this elbow's way on that side
 

51
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,950
m this this elbow's way on that side
okay so I have to want to do a mul look

52
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:35,960
okay so I have to want to do a mul look
 

53
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,510
okay so I have to want to do a mul look
you see I put that elbow on this side of

54
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
you see I put that elbow on this side of
 

55
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,310
you see I put that elbow on this side of
me so it's easy for me to get on the

56
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
me so it's easy for me to get on the
 

57
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,990
me so it's easy for me to get on the
back side with one entry you

58
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,000
back side with one entry you
 

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,270
back side with one entry you
see Margaret

60
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280

 

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,429

say but

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,990

it so although my hand is doing the same

72
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
it so although my hand is doing the same
 

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,710
it so although my hand is doing the same
thing and I'm still on that angle I'm

74
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
thing and I'm still on that angle I'm
 

75
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,750
thing and I'm still on that angle I'm
going to move you in a

76
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
going to move you in a
 

77
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,630
going to move you in a
way that it'll

78
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,640

work so I'm going to give you a

80
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
work so I'm going to give you a
 

81
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,270
work so I'm going to give you a
reference a Mor is going to take your

82
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,280
reference a Mor is going to take your
 

83
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,790
reference a Mor is going to take your
whole body and move

whole body and move
 

85
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,910
whole body and move
it as if I'm throwing you

86
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
it as if I'm throwing you
 

87
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,030
it as if I'm throwing you
away or this takes the front of your

88
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
away or this takes the front of your
 

89
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,830
away or this takes the front of your
body the front of your body only the

90
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
body the front of your body only the
 

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,869
body the front of your body only the
front you see then I can get

92
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879

 

93
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,110

behind doing the same

94
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,120
behind doing the same
 

95
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,790
behind doing the same
thing is eventually going to be in the

96
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
thing is eventually going to be in the
 

97
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,149
thing is eventually going to be in the
wrong place then it's the wrong

98
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159

 

99
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,110

thing so you have you have an external

100
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,120
thing so you have you have an external
 

101
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,190
thing so you have you have an external
solution to what I did okay so you come

102
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
solution to what I did okay so you come
 

103
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,949
solution to what I did okay so you come
over here and you push the core okay and

104
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
over here and you push the core okay and
 

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,110
over here and you push the core okay and
then you now I can't get to ur unless I

106
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
then you now I can't get to ur unless I
 

107
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,990
then you now I can't get to ur unless I
move your arm where I would have wanted

108
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
move your arm where I would have wanted
 

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,589
move your arm where I would have wanted
it in the first place so you see that so

110
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:22,599
it in the first place so you see that so
 

111
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,430
it in the first place so you see that so
you go you go here why don't you step

112
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
you go you go here why don't you step
 

113
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,229
you go you go here why don't you step
and then I won't have to push you okay

114
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
and then I won't have to push you okay
 

115
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,509
and then I won't have to push you okay
so

116
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:30,519
so
 

117
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,429
so
's close stay there I'm supposed to be

118
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:34,439
's close stay there I'm supposed to be
 

119
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,750
's close stay there I'm supposed to be
here but I'm not so what you do is you

120
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
here but I'm not so what you do is you
 

121
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,390
here but I'm not so what you do is you
now grab the arm and now you moved it to

122
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
now grab the arm and now you moved it to
 

123
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,869
now grab the arm and now you moved it to
where it is you see that that's

124
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:45,879

 

125
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:53,030

external so uh when I come

126
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040

 

127
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,190

around instead of pushing into your core

128
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,200
around instead of pushing into your core
 

129
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,030
around instead of pushing into your core
like that you see I push into your core

130
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040

 

131
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,229

I just touch this surface

132
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,239
I just touch this surface
 

133
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,190
I just touch this surface
here this part just this part okay and

134
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
here this part just this part okay and
 

135
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,710
here this part just this part okay and
look where you're going to

136
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
look where you're going to
 

137
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,349
look where you're going to
go you see there we

138
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:18,359

 

139
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,909

go just the just the surface

140
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919

 

141
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,550

around

142
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,560
around
 

143
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,870
around
surface there

144
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
surface there
 

145
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,310
surface there
okay not everything is pushed through

146
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,320
okay not everything is pushed through
 

147
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,029
okay not everything is pushed through
okay try it

148
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,039

 

149
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,430

again so um I have a yyong

150
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
again so um I have a yyong
 

151
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,350
again so um I have a yyong
theory okay and by that theory all

152
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,360
theory okay and by that theory all
 

153
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,830
theory okay and by that theory all
things are

154
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
things are
 

155
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,150
things are
categorized Yin or Y and I also know

156
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,160
categorized Yin or Y and I also know
 

157
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,710
categorized Yin or Y and I also know
that within every Yin there's some y

158
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
that within every Yin there's some y
 

159
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,150
that within every Yin there's some y
just my theory okay all things

160
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
just my theory okay all things
 

161
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,790
just my theory okay all things
are categorized in

162
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:03,800
are categorized in
 

163
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,590
are categorized in
that dichotomy but that dichotomy is

164
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:08,600
that dichotomy but that dichotomy is
 

165
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,790
that dichotomy but that dichotomy is
relative okay it's Yin Yong to varying

166
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:13,800
relative okay it's Yin Yong to varying
 

167
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,029
relative okay it's Yin Yong to varying
degrees but it is Yin or

168
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
degrees but it is Yin or
 

169
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,150
degrees but it is Yin or
yangong from a particular perspective

170
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
yangong from a particular perspective
 

171
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,950
yangong from a particular perspective
every always

172
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
every always
 

173
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,550
every always
okay so I have an inward spiral and I

174
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
okay so I have an inward spiral and I
 

175
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,029
okay so I have an inward spiral and I
have an out spiral but that does not

176
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
have an out spiral but that does not
 

177
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,870
have an out spiral but that does not
mean

178
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:31,880

 

179
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,390

that I do my hand the same way every

180
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
that I do my hand the same way every
 

181
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,870
that I do my hand the same way every
time through

182
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
time through
 

183
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,350
time through
space is that's not how it works so just

184
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:40,360
space is that's not how it works so just
 

185
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,309
space is that's not how it works so just
as something is always Yin or

186
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:45,319
as something is always Yin or
 

187
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,070
as something is always Yin or
Yong and something always yin yangong to

188
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
Yong and something always yin yangong to
 

189
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,150
Yong and something always yin yangong to
varying degrees how much yin to how much

190
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
varying degrees how much yin to how much
 

191
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,790
varying degrees how much yin to how much
Yong do you see that all things are

192
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:53,800
Yong do you see that all things are
 

193
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,270
Yong do you see that all things are
that but inside is an infinite variation

194
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,280
that but inside is an infinite variation
 

195
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,550
that but inside is an infinite variation
potential and this same thing goes with

196
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
potential and this same thing goes with
 

197
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,230
potential and this same thing goes with
my inward or my outward spiral and I

198
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
my inward or my outward spiral and I
 

199
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,029
my inward or my outward spiral and I
don't do the same thing every time okay

200
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
don't do the same thing every time okay
 

201
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,230
don't do the same thing every time okay
so for example okay I can project him

202
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
so for example okay I can project him
 

203
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,230
so for example okay I can project him
out with this spiral and at no point

204
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
out with this spiral and at no point
 

205
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,110
out with this spiral and at no point
I'll do it again okay at no point can he

206
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll do it again okay at no point can he
 

207
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,749
I'll do it again okay at no point can he
come in with that spiral so even even if

208
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
come in with that spiral so even even if
 

209
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,110
come in with that spiral so even even if
he wanted to he can't come forward with

210
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
he wanted to he can't come forward with
 

211
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,309
he wanted to he can't come forward with
that spiral he can't come forward

212
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319

 

213
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,670

okay well I can do it in resp spiral

214
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
okay well I can do it in resp spiral
 

215
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,749
okay well I can do it in resp spiral
change it shape just a little is timing

216
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:38,759
change it shape just a little is timing
 

217
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,909
change it shape just a little is timing
on how it's passing through this and you

218
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:40,919
on how it's passing through this and you
 

219
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,670
on how it's passing through this and you
see I brought him forward and over

220
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680
see I brought him forward and over
 

221
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,270
see I brought him forward and over
towards my

222
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,280
towards my
 

223
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,070
towards my
left can do the same thing and

224
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
left can do the same thing and
 

225
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,790
left can do the same thing and
look he's going this

226
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
look he's going this
 

227
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,550
look he's going this
way still an inward spiral you guys get

228
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
way still an inward spiral you guys get
 

229
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,469
way still an inward spiral you guys get
that okay it's not that I do this and

230
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:57,479
that okay it's not that I do this and
 

231
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,270
that okay it's not that I do this and
then Uka decides what he's going to do

232
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,280
then Uka decides what he's going to do
 

233
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,589
then Uka decides what he's going to do
can't UK can't do something else UK

234
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
can't UK can't do something else UK
 

235
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,270
can't UK can't do something else UK
can't do something

236
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280

 

237
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,230

else okay so like let's say he he's

238
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
else okay so like let's say he he's
 

239
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,550
else okay so like let's say he he's
trying to to pull just going to come

240
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:15,560
trying to to pull just going to come
 

241
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,909
trying to to pull just going to come
more in that way okay on that one over

242
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
more in that way okay on that one over
 

243
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,710
more in that way okay on that one over
here so I can't I I'm telling you that

244
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:25,720
here so I can't I I'm telling you that
 

245
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,309
here so I can't I I'm telling you that
Ur the K is on the surface of him

246
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
Ur the K is on the surface of him
 

247
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,950
Ur the K is on the surface of him
you can't do the same inward spiral that

248
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
you can't do the same inward spiral that
 

249
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,189
you can't do the same inward spiral that
keeps him out and trying to be on the

250
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
keeps him out and trying to be on the
 

251
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,510
keeps him out and trying to be on the
surface with less penetration it doesn't

252
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
surface with less penetration it doesn't
 

253
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,990
surface with less penetration it doesn't
work you have to

254
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
work you have to
 

255
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,430
work you have to
change which inward spiral you do

256
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,440

 

257
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,230

okay meaning you have to change its

258
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
okay meaning you have to change its
 

259
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,110
okay meaning you have to change its
yinong values okay they're not

260
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
yinong values okay they're not
 

261
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,629
yinong values okay they're not
constant so the reason I do this is as

262
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
constant so the reason I do this is as
 

263
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,710
constant so the reason I do this is as
we already

264
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
we already
 

265
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,390
we already
mentioned I don't want to do an external

266
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:03,400
mentioned I don't want to do an external
 

267
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,550
mentioned I don't want to do an external
thing one there's no energetics to it

268
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,560
thing one there's no energetics to it
 

269
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,270
thing one there's no energetics to it
two grab hard I can't pull that off I

270
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
two grab hard I can't pull that off I
 

271
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,589
two grab hard I can't pull that off I
cannot pull that off it's not Marshall

272
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
cannot pull that off it's not Marshall
 

273
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,869
cannot pull that off it's not Marshall
okay and I don't want to use that outer

274
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
okay and I don't want to use that outer
 

275
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,149
okay and I don't want to use that outer
delto so when I go inside only on the

276
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:19,159
delto so when I go inside only on the
 

277
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,469
delto so when I go inside only on the
surface you can see that I'm moving I

278
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
surface you can see that I'm moving I
 

279
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,670
surface you can see that I'm moving I
can now enter around it push out of the

280
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
can now enter around it push out of the
 

281
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,430
can now enter around it push out of the
grip just like a m

282
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
grip just like a m
 

283
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,310
grip just like a m
does and then under the same

284
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
does and then under the same
 

285
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,029
does and then under the same
technique without using the outer

286
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
technique without using the outer
 

287
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,269

delto it's hand

288
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279
delto it's hand
 

289
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,110
delto it's hand
just

290
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,120
just
 

291
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,910
just
falls into my other

292
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:44,920

 

293
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920

hand okay
