1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,309

okay so we'll play the game again where

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
okay so we'll play the game again where
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,030
okay so we'll play the game again where
uh he's trying to touch my chest

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
uh he's trying to touch my chest
 

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,070
uh he's trying to touch my chest
okay

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
okay
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:21,990
okay
are we going

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000

 

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:51,830

so

10
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840

 

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:07,190

so

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200

 

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,350

all right so you said he kept getting

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
all right so you said he kept getting
 

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:33,350
all right so you said he kept getting
your chest all right let's see some go

16
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360

 

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,429

okay so some of these passes that you're

18
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
okay so some of these passes that you're
 

19
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,910
okay so some of these passes that you're
doing these these tessa bucky passes

20
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
doing these these tessa bucky passes
 

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
doing these these tessa bucky passes
you're doing they're they're okay

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
you're doing they're they're okay
 

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,670
you're doing they're they're okay
but you don't have uh

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
but you don't have uh
 

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,350
but you don't have uh
any of your ikea or your coq

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
any of your ikea or your coq
 

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,350
any of your ikea or your coq
taking his balance

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
taking his balance
 

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,510
taking his balance
so eventually he's going to get it

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
so eventually he's going to get it
 

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,270
so eventually he's going to get it
because he's offense he has the

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
because he's offense he has the
 

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,590
because he's offense he has the
initiative you're reactionary

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
initiative you're reactionary
 

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,350
initiative you're reactionary
at how you're doing it okay

36
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
at how you're doing it okay
 

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,910
at how you're doing it okay
so you for example uh he he pushed okay

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
so you for example uh he he pushed okay
 

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,070
so you for example uh he he pushed okay
and i saw you come around very nice okay

40
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
and i saw you come around very nice okay
 

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,790
and i saw you come around very nice okay
so

42
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
so
 

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,430
so
he pushed he didn't block him

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
he pushed he didn't block him
 

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,910
he pushed he didn't block him
you push you yielded and he came to this

46
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
you push you yielded and he came to this
 

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,229
you push you yielded and he came to this
one but then nothing happened to his

48
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
one but then nothing happened to his
 

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,110
one but then nothing happened to his
balance and there it is

50
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
balance and there it is
 

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,510
balance and there it is
so same thing he comes around you yield

52
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
so same thing he comes around you yield
 

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,470
so same thing he comes around you yield
but there

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480

 

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,110

so if we watch again there's two things

56
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
so if we watch again there's two things
 

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,350
so if we watch again there's two things
that are doing this hand is already

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
that are doing this hand is already
 

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,110
that are doing this hand is already
taken off balance so i could take this

60
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
taken off balance so i could take this
 

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,990
taken off balance so i could take this
one over

62
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000

 

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,910

but usually i go here this hands is dead

64
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
but usually i go here this hands is dead
 

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,229
but usually i go here this hands is dead
that's how he got in

66
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
that's how he got in
 

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,830
that's how he got in
so if he comes around i yield here this

68
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
so if he comes around i yield here this
 

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,150
so if he comes around i yield here this
hand was not dead even though this he's

70
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
hand was not dead even though this he's
 

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,830
hand was not dead even though this he's
pushing here this hand is still doing

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
pushing here this hand is still doing
 

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,910
pushing here this hand is still doing
something boom there it is right

74
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920

 

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,270

or you could he pushes you pass and it

76
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
or you could he pushes you pass and it
 

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,270
or you could he pushes you pass and it
goes right into there there's your

78
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
goes right into there there's your
 

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,949
goes right into there there's your
there's your concu

80
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
there's your concu
 

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,309
there's your concu
so you pass this

82
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319

 

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,670

and of course you can do the two

84
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
and of course you can do the two
 

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,190
and of course you can do the two
together

86
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200

 

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,830

but you can't just that your your

88
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
but you can't just that your your
 

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,750
but you can't just that your your
you have a coke you you have a

90
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
you have a coke you you have a
 

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,550
you have a coke you you have a
separating force right so well we're

92
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
separating force right so well we're
 

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,790
separating force right so well we're
here well a separating force and you

94
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
here well a separating force and you
 

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,670
here well a separating force and you
have an adhesion force you understand so

96
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
have an adhesion force you understand so
 

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,589
have an adhesion force you understand so
coccus separating force

98
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599

 

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,670

adhesion force but both of them

100
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
adhesion force but both of them
 

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,190
adhesion force but both of them
are working towards a kazushi

102
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
are working towards a kazushi
 

103
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,430
are working towards a kazushi

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,430
is that what we did i don't know what
you did

174
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
you did
 

175
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,270
you did
okay all right

176
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
okay all right
 

177
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,990
okay all right
uh yeah it was almost on the outside so

178
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
uh yeah it was almost on the outside so
 

179
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,469
uh yeah it was almost on the outside so
this hand has a coq at first

180
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
this hand has a coq at first
 

181
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,390
this hand has a coq at first
this hand will have an eye here at first

182
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
this hand will have an eye here at first
 

183
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,270
this hand will have an eye here at first
so this sound here it has an adhesion

184
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
so this sound here it has an adhesion
 

185
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,150
so this sound here it has an adhesion
going

186
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
going
 

187
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,710
going
oh it's not blocking him

188
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
oh it's not blocking him
 

189
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,110
oh it's not blocking him
this hand is blocking him

190
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
this hand is blocking him
 

191
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,350
this hand is blocking him
but as this hand

192
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
but as this hand
 

193
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,550
but as this hand
passes through the ikey face

194
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
passes through the ikey face
 

195
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,469
passes through the ikey face
it's now going to be in the cold cue

196
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
it's now going to be in the cold cue
 

197
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,629
it's now going to be in the cold cue
phase and you can see over here is the

198
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
phase and you can see over here is the
 

199
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,270
phase and you can see over here is the
adhesion

200
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
adhesion
 

201
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,310
adhesion
but both of them are working together to

202
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
but both of them are working together to
 

203
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,629
but both of them are working together to
take his balance

204
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
take his balance
 

205
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,189
take his balance
okay so you can't just be here

206
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
okay so you can't just be here
 

207
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,950
okay so you can't just be here
not take balance

208
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
not take balance
 

209
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,189
not take balance
you can only stick and follow for so

210
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
you can only stick and follow for so
 

211
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,749
you can only stick and follow for so
long it's gonna get you okay and it's

212
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
long it's gonna get you okay and it's
 

213
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,350
long it's gonna get you okay and it's
also not the drill

214
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
also not the drill
 

215
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,390
also not the drill
all right

216
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
all right
 

217
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,870
all right
let's try again

218
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
let's try again
 

219
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,390
let's try again
all right all right so you you're

220
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
all right all right so you you're
 

221
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,390
all right all right so you you're
talking about this world of power once

222
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
talking about this world of power once
 

223
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,790
talking about this world of power once
you feel like you can't get it you enter

224
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
you feel like you can't get it you enter
 

225
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,150
you feel like you can't get it you enter
into a contest stating mindset you

226
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
into a contest stating mindset you
 

227
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,830
into a contest stating mindset you
against her

228
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
against her
 

229
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,189
against her
okay so

230
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
okay so
 

231
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,230
okay so
what what ends up happening as i said is

232
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
what what ends up happening as i said is
 

233
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,390
what what ends up happening as i said is
now you're in dichotomy

234
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
now you're in dichotomy
 

235
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,469
now you're in dichotomy
but it's a dichotomy that's working

236
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
but it's a dichotomy that's working
 

237
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,390
but it's a dichotomy that's working
through the through fear and through a

238
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
through the through fear and through a
 

239
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,990
through the through fear and through a
will to power

240
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
will to power
 

241
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,230
will to power
and what ends up happening is you you

242
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
and what ends up happening is you you
 

243
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,469
and what ends up happening is you you
start this path of annihilating the

244
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
start this path of annihilating the
 

245
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,590
start this path of annihilating the
other okay so in this case is where

246
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
other okay so in this case is where
 

247
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,390
other okay so in this case is where
instead of one hand being yin one hand

248
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
instead of one hand being yin one hand
 

249
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,550
instead of one hand being yin one hand
being young or in other words one hand

250
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
being young or in other words one hand
 

251
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,350
being young or in other words one hand
being ikey in one hand in communion and

252
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
being ikey in one hand in communion and
 

253
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,590
being ikey in one hand in communion and
the other hand in separating force call

254
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
the other hand in separating force call
 

255
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,309
the other hand in separating force call
q

256
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
q
 

257
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,790
q
you have like two just pushing hands

258
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
you have like two just pushing hands
 

259
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,309
you have like two just pushing hands
okay so go

260
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319

 

261
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,390

right there it was

262
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400

 

263
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,990

two pushing hands

264
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000

 

265
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,909

pushing your thumb do you see your thumb

266
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
pushing your thumb do you see your thumb
 

267
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,189
pushing your thumb do you see your thumb
hooked her

268
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
hooked her
 

269
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,629
hooked her
you're just trying to stop her from

270
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
you're just trying to stop her from
 

271
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,589
you're just trying to stop her from
going

272
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
going
 

273
00:06:49,599 --> 00:07:02,309
going
okay

274
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319

 

275
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,909

okay and as you fluctuate in this

276
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
okay and as you fluctuate in this
 

277
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,309
okay and as you fluctuate in this
dichotomy and a lot of you're doing this

278
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
dichotomy and a lot of you're doing this
 

279
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,110
dichotomy and a lot of you're doing this
you you start to go on off

280
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
you you start to go on off
 

281
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,270
you you start to go on off
in the way that you're touching her

282
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
in the way that you're touching her
 

283
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,589
in the way that you're touching her
center like you're you're

284
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
center like you're you're
 

285
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,990
center like you're you're
sometimes you are then you go off

286
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
sometimes you are then you go off
 

287
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,990
sometimes you are then you go off
because you want to save yourself

288
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
because you want to save yourself
 

289
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,390
because you want to save yourself
and then you go back on and so and

290
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
and then you go back on and so and
 

291
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,950
and then you go back on and so and
because you go off that's what triggers

292
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
because you go off that's what triggers
 

293
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,270
because you go off that's what triggers
the fear response because now comes at

294
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
the fear response because now comes at
 

295
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,749
the fear response because now comes at
you and on rush or quickly or something

296
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
you and on rush or quickly or something
 

297
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,070
you and on rush or quickly or something
you feel behind you feel overpowered you

298
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
you feel behind you feel overpowered you
 

299
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,670
you feel behind you feel overpowered you
feel they're going to get you okay

300
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680

 

301
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,189

okay

302
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
okay
 

303
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,390
okay
so first thing to mention is uh

304
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
so first thing to mention is uh
 

305
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,189
so first thing to mention is uh
uh

306
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
uh
 

307
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,110
uh
then this is probably for the more

308
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
then this is probably for the more
 

309
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,790
then this is probably for the more
advanced okay

310
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
advanced okay
 

311
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,350
advanced okay
so yin yang is

312
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
so yin yang is
 

313
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,670
so yin yang is
a theory in relativity

314
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
a theory in relativity
 

315
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,390
a theory in relativity
so

316
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
so
 

317
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,830
so
that means

318
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
that means
 

319
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,430
that means
while it is true

320
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
while it is true
 

321
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,790
while it is true
it's only true from a point of view

322
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
it's only true from a point of view
 

323
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,950
it's only true from a point of view
which means it's false from another

324
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
which means it's false from another
 

325
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,029
which means it's false from another
point of view okay

326
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
point of view okay
 

327
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,309
point of view okay
so uh the way i described it

328
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
so uh the way i described it
 

329
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,830
so uh the way i described it
um

330
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
um
 

331
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,150
um
earlier it's very convenient and it's

332
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
earlier it's very convenient and it's
 

333
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,629
earlier it's very convenient and it's
very easy for someone to understand

334
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
very easy for someone to understand
 

335
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,270
very easy for someone to understand
because it's presented in a binary kind

336
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
because it's presented in a binary kind
 

337
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,790
because it's presented in a binary kind
of fashion but it's ultimately not true

338
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
of fashion but it's ultimately not true
 

339
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,909
of fashion but it's ultimately not true
okay because it's relative

340
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
okay because it's relative
 

341
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,510
okay because it's relative
um

342
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
um
 

343
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,430
um
i let's say you're not you're not

344
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
i let's say you're not you're not
 

345
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,670
i let's say you're not you're not
pushing on this hand there's no there's

346
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
pushing on this hand there's no there's
 

347
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,950
pushing on this hand there's no there's
no energy on this hand okay that that's

348
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
no energy on this hand okay that that's
 

349
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,589
no energy on this hand okay that that's
not true that's not a true statement

350
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
not true that's not a true statement
 

351
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,749
not true that's not a true statement
the energy on this hand whether there is

352
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
the energy on this hand whether there is
 

353
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,790
the energy on this hand whether there is
some or is not some is only relative to

354
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
some or is not some is only relative to
 

355
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,110
some or is not some is only relative to
in this case the energy of my hand

356
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
in this case the energy of my hand
 

357
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,589
in this case the energy of my hand
you see so if i'm trying to shove this

358
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
you see so if i'm trying to shove this
 

359
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,589
you see so if i'm trying to shove this
hand that feels like no energy in this

360
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
hand that feels like no energy in this
 

361
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,870
hand that feels like no energy in this
thing but if i match if i match that i'm

362
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
thing but if i match if i match that i'm
 

363
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,030
thing but if i match if i match that i'm
matching it i'm matching it matching it

364
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
matching it i'm matching it matching it
 

365
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,949
matching it i'm matching it matching it
matching

366
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
matching
 

367
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,310
matching
so

368
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
so
 

369
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,230
so
in other words

370
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
in other words
 

371
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,710
in other words
this will not project you if you relax

372
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
this will not project you if you relax
 

373
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,350
this will not project you if you relax
your hand you relax your super super yin

374
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
your hand you relax your super super yin
 

375
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,990
your hand you relax your super super yin
you super yin that will not project you

376
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
you super yin that will not project you
 

377
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,630
you super yin that will not project you
but if i go more yin than you

378
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
but if i go more yin than you
 

379
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,190
but if i go more yin than you
you see then this hand is now

380
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
you see then this hand is now
 

381
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,350
you see then this hand is now
young so you're going more yen i go more

382
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
young so you're going more yen i go more
 

383
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,990
young so you're going more yen i go more
yin you go more yin i go maury is you

trying to relax i i relax more you see
and then

388
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
and then
 

389
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,470
and then
you see all right it's still clearly on

390
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
you see all right it's still clearly on
 

391
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,590
you see all right it's still clearly on
him

392
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
him
 

393
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,870
him
do you understand that okay so

394
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
do you understand that okay so
 

395
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,829
do you understand that okay so
this is the downside of flexing and

396
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
this is the downside of flexing and
 

397
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,190
this is the downside of flexing and
pushing because you're going to make

398
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
pushing because you're going to make
 

399
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,389
pushing because you're going to make
their

400
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
their
 

401
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,389
their
energy yin by comparison okay and now

402
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
energy yin by comparison okay and now
 

403
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,110
energy yin by comparison okay and now
they're always yielding to what you're

it's partly not true
 

459
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,590
it's partly not true
okay because it's a theory in relativity

460
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
okay because it's a theory in relativity
 

461
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,550
okay because it's a theory in relativity
okay

462
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
okay

so
 

465
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,790
so
uh and that's important because what
