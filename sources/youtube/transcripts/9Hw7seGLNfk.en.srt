now this is a contradiction but it's

00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,120
now this is a contradiction but it's
 

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,430
now this is a contradiction but it's
another one in Tai CH it's called the

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,440
another one in Tai CH it's called the
 

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,990
another one in Tai CH it's called the
bird's beak where you put all your

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,000
bird's beak where you put all your
 

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,509
bird's beak where you put all your
fingers together and the thumb goes the

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
fingers together and the thumb goes the
 

9
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,830
fingers together and the thumb goes the
thumb goes in the

10
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:10,840
thumb goes in the
 

11
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,789
thumb goes in the
middle the bird's beak goes

12
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
middle the bird's beak goes
 

13
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,990
middle the bird's beak goes
over and it's the same as the open

14
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
over and it's the same as the open
 

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,590
over and it's the same as the open
hand so this is as long as you're all

hand so this is as long as you're all
right with contradictions you get on

18
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
right with contradictions you get on
 

19
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,630
right with contradictions you get on
well in

20
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,640
well in
 

21
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,870
well in
aikido right because this I'm saying the

22
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:27,880
aikido right because this I'm saying the
 

23
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,549
aikido right because this I'm saying the
complete opposite and I about the

24
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:31,559
complete opposite and I about the
 

25
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,510
complete opposite and I about the
fingers but you don't know what

26
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
fingers but you don't know what

can just I mean you've got to be to
 

35
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,470
can just I mean you've got to be to
adapt to any

00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
adapt to any
 

37
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,750
adapt to any
position it comes

38
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:48,760
position it comes
 

39
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,869
position it comes
up it goes

40
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
up it goes
 

41
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,069
up it goes
over and I'm going to go through all

42
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,079
over and I'm going to go through all

I say okay it's just backwards yeah I
know

54
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
know
 

55
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,030
know
okay so he's on the line his arms on the

56
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
okay so he's on the line his arms on the
 

57
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,030
okay so he's on the line his arms on the
line and this is what's happening those

58
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
line and this is what's happening those
 

59
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,350
line and this is what's happening those
who can see it you're sort of turning

60
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,360
who can see it you're sort of turning
 

61
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,149
who can see it you're sort of turning
over and it's going this side of the

62
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
over and it's going this side of the
 

63
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,149
over and it's going this side of the
line and then by the time you get there

64
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
line and then by the time you get there
 

65
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,630
line and then by the time you get there
it's G on that side of the

66
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
it's G on that side of the
 

67
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,190
it's G on that side of the
line and you you know you third down and

68
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,200
line and you you know you third down and
 

69
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,910
line and you you know you third down and
above really should be keeping it

70
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
above really should be keeping it
 

71
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,149
above really should be keeping it
exactly on the line and you should be

72
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,159
exactly on the line and you should be
 

73
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,830
exactly on the line and you should be
moving you should be

74
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
moving you should be
 

75
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,990
moving you should be
moving so bird's beak over out all right

76
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
moving so bird's beak over out all right
 

77
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,789
moving so bird's beak over out all right
so this now isn't that isn't

78
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:47,799
so this now isn't that isn't
 

79
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,830
so this now isn't that isn't
that so so don't get confused by going

80
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
that so so don't get confused by going
 

81
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,350
that so so don't get confused by going
here here oh I need to open my fingers

82
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
here here oh I need to open my fingers
 

83
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,590
here here oh I need to open my fingers
cuz it you know it's not going to be

84
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
cuz it you know it's not going to be
 

85
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,630
cuz it you know it's not going to be
right is

86
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640
right is
 

87
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,550
right is
it strong

88
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,560

 

89
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,029

that's when you open your

90
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039
that's when you open your
 

91
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,990
that's when you open your
fingers when you when you're going to

92
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
fingers when you when you're going to
 

93
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,990
fingers when you when you're going to
let your full tiger out of

94
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000

 

95
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,750

the can't get out is because I

96
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,760

 

97
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,869

again still on the

98
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879
again still on the
 

99
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,509
again still on the
line right the more they hold the more

100
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:27,519
line right the more they hold the more
 

101
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,750
line right the more they hold the more
you'll find that it will vary where it's

102
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:30,760
you'll find that it will vary where it's
 

103
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,710
you'll find that it will vary where it's
going keep it where it

104
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
going keep it where it
 

105
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,030
going keep it where it
is and you'll get it okay so the bird's

106
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
is and you'll get it okay so the bird's
 

107
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,270
is and you'll get it okay so the bird's
beak it goes over under and

108
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,280
beak it goes over under and
 

109
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,319
beak it goes over under and
out okay d
