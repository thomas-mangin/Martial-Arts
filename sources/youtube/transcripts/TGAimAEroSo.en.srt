1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:04,789

all right so you have your your PO set

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
all right so you have your your PO set
 

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,230
all right so you have your your PO set
right and now you're doing a uh on iido

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
right and now you're doing a uh on iido
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,709
right and now you're doing a uh on iido
technique and really what it adds is

6
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
technique and really what it adds is
 

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,589
technique and really what it adds is
keep the the same internal organization

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
keep the the same internal organization
 

9
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,029
keep the the same internal organization
the same internal mechanics so to speak

10
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
the same internal mechanics so to speak
 

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,550
the same internal mechanics so to speak
but add the my so the timing and the

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
but add the my so the timing and the
 

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,750
but add the my so the timing and the
space is now part of the technique okay

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
space is now part of the technique okay
 

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,470
space is now part of the technique okay
so don't do anything different don't

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
so don't do anything different don't
 

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,589
so don't do anything different don't
don't go back to weirdness okay like

18
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
don't go back to weirdness okay like
 

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,630
don't go back to weirdness okay like
you're your shoulders and that kind of

20
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:31,640
you're your shoulders and that kind of
 

21
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,150
you're your shoulders and that kind of
stuff so you still have your pns you do

22
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,160
stuff so you still have your pns you do
 

23
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,110
stuff so you still have your pns you do
your

24
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
your
 

25
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,750
your
patterns I have the inward spiral which

26
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:40,760
patterns I have the inward spiral which
 

27
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,990
patterns I have the inward spiral which
is wrist in elbow out but not further

28
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
is wrist in elbow out but not further
 

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,830
is wrist in elbow out but not further
than your Y Line and then the other one

30
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:46,840
than your Y Line and then the other one
 

31
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,869
than your Y Line and then the other one
is elbow in elbow

32
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:49,879
is elbow in elbow
 

33
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,270
is elbow in elbow
in wrist out so the outward

34
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,280
in wrist out so the outward
 

35
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,310
in wrist out so the outward
spir

36
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
spir
 

37
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,910
spir
then don't just push

38
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
then don't just push
 

39
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,189
then don't just push

handh holding because you're supposed to

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
handh holding because you're supposed to
 

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,109
handh holding because you're supposed to
create this spinal displacement okay

50
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:20,119
create this spinal displacement okay
 

51
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:28,910
create this spinal displacement okay
that's what I working

52
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920

 

53
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,030

with

54
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,040

 

55
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,630

moving so for example my your H my hand

56
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,640
moving so for example my your H my hand
 

57
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,870
moving so for example my your H my hand
should never get here cuz you changed

58
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
should never get here cuz you changed
 

59
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,069
should never get here cuz you changed
your articulation in your elbow and I

60
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
your articulation in your elbow and I
 

61
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,870
your articulation in your elbow and I
should have never got there on you

62
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:41,880
should have never got there on you
 

63
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,670
should have never got there on you
either because that means I'm in your

64
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
either because that means I'm in your
 

65
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,590
either because that means I'm in your
arm okay so from from touch I'm in that

66
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:52,600

 

67
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,990

Center and then now you have the foot

68
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,000
Center and then now you have the foot
 

69
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,389
Center and then now you have the foot
maneuver so you can't lose it so the

70
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
maneuver so you can't lose it so the
 

71
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,149
maneuver so you can't lose it so the
same

72
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
same
 

73
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,230
same
structure I don't lose as I

74
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,240
structure I don't lose as I
 

75
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,510
structure I don't lose as I
move don't don't lose it okay and then

76
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
move don't don't lose it okay and then
 

77
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,390
move don't don't lose it okay and then
now so now you have your

78
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
now so now you have your
 

79
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,910
now so now you have your
eys stay there so your hand has to be

80
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
eys stay there so your hand has to be
 

81
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,150
eys stay there so your hand has to be
head

83
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,030
head
level it's going to make your arm at a

84
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,040
level it's going to make your arm at a
 

85
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,190
level it's going to make your arm at a
45° angle okay and just like all coku

86
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
45° angle okay and just like all coku
 

87
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,390
45° angle okay and just like all coku
hole the energy is over here not here

88
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
hole the energy is over here not here
 

89
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,390
hole the energy is over here not here
under you

90
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
under you
 

91
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,550
under you
you over here but I'm not here okay so

I'm here like this and I release and
 

95
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,589
I'm here like this and I release and
drop the

96
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:40,599
drop the
 

97
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,309
drop the
cheek and that's what you're trying to

98
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319
cheek and that's what you're trying to
 

99
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,070
cheek and that's what you're trying to
push on and I drop you're done you're

100
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,080
push on and I drop you're done you're
 

101
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,030
push on and I drop you're done you're
done

102
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040

 

103
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,710

okay so some

104
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
okay so some
 

105
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,710
okay so some
mistakes you have

106
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
mistakes you have
 

107
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,430
mistakes you have
two Y moves in the elbows now

108
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
two Y moves in the elbows now
 

109
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,990
two Y moves in the elbows now
okay um once here in yielding is the I

110
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
okay um once here in yielding is the I
 

111
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,910
okay um once here in yielding is the I
key going this

112
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
key going this
 

113
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,149
key going this
way not need to be taken that far though

114
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
way not need to be taken that far though
 

115
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,589
way not need to be taken that far though
okay and then the C the I key boom loads

116
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
okay and then the C the I key boom loads
 

117
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,070
okay and then the C the I key boom loads
the C hand okay on the inward

118
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
the C hand okay on the inward
 

119
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,990
the C hand okay on the inward
side the

120
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
side the
 

121
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,470
side the
quock closed here on the right and

122
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
quock closed here on the right and
 

123
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,229
quock closed here on the right and
then it transfers over

124
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:31,239
then it transfers over
 

125
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:46,390
then it transfers over
boom drop the

126
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400

 

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:59,949

chi all right

128
00:03:59,949 --> 00:03:59,959

 

129
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,110

and you you're going to try to push back

130
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,120
and you you're going to try to push back
 

131
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,830
and you you're going to try to push back
on that okay Margaret you can even turn

132
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:04,840
on that okay Margaret you can even turn
 

133
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,229
on that okay Margaret you can even turn
your body back that

134
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:11,239

 

135
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,509

way yield more in that left

136
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
way yield more in that left
 

137
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,509
way yield more in that left
hand and then it goes off when you

138
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
hand and then it goes off when you
 

139
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:40,150
hand and then it goes off when you
move he

140
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160

 

141
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,270

okay

142
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280

 

143
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,670

ding see how she

144
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:50,680

 

145
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,629

falls hang here for forever okay you

146
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
falls hang here for forever okay you
 

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,830
falls hang here for forever okay you
have to have a yield

148
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840

 

149
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,350

it's just a controlled yield okay so if

150
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
it's just a controlled yield okay so if
 

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,830
it's just a controlled yield okay so if
she's if she's pulling you're still

152
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
she's if she's pulling you're still
 

153
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,990
she's if she's pulling you're still
going to do

154
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
going to do
 

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,710
going to do
it you get it it's not

156
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:11,720
it you get it it's not
 

157
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,029
it you get it it's not
it's meaning it's not mean just

158
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:16,039
it's meaning it's not mean just
 

159
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,230
it's meaning it's not mean just
collapsing there's a Integrity to it

160
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,240
collapsing there's a Integrity to it
 

161
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,430
collapsing there's a Integrity to it
such that you can't pull against it

162
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
such that you can't pull against it
 

163
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,749
such that you can't pull against it
pulls you in you see but it's not

164
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
pulls you in you see but it's not
 

165
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,670
pulls you in you see but it's not
holding you up the reason it's holding

166
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,680
holding you up the reason it's holding
 

167
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,110
holding you up the reason it's holding
her up on you is you have positive y on

168
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
her up on you is you have positive y on
 

169
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,790
her up on you is you have positive y on
there she's bracing on it you you'll

170
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:35,800
there she's bracing on it you you'll

pressure there okay and then I now
release

348
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
release
 

349
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,949
release
tension you see right that's that's the

350
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
tension you see right that's that's the
 

351
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,670
tension you see right that's that's the
G sinking now so once I release and now

352
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
G sinking now so once I release and now
 

353
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,670
G sinking now so once I release and now
you try to

354
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
you try to
 

355
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,710
you try to
lift and we're not going anywhere okay

356
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
lift and we're not going anywhere okay
 

357
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,430
lift and we're not going anywhere okay
I'll release seon

358
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,440
I'll release seon
 

359
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,310
I'll release seon
more you

360
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
more you
 

361
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,990
more you
see and that's what makes it cou

362
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
see and that's what makes it cou
 

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,150
see and that's what makes it cou
ho

364
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
ho
 

365
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,269
ho
okay and that's what you're doing in the

366
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
okay and that's what you're doing in the
 

367
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,269
okay and that's what you're doing in the
C you set that's what you're trying to

368
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279
C you set that's what you're trying to
 

369
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,590
C you set that's what you're trying to
release we're just standing you see

370
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
release we're just standing you see
 

371
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,550
release we're just standing you see
um that's what you do at all the end of

372
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
um that's what you do at all the end of
 

373
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,230
um that's what you do at all the end of
iido ke pins they're not pins they're C

374
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
iido ke pins they're not pins they're C
 

375
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,750
iido ke pins they're not pins they're C
you release

376
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
you release
 

377
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,150
you release
the the that way it just drops and

378
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,160
the the that way it just drops and
 

379
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,910
the the that way it just drops and
things get heavy okay

380
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
things get heavy okay
 

381
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,470
things get heavy okay
um it's not a pin I'm not pinning you I

382
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
um it's not a pin I'm not pinning you I
 

383
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,110
um it's not a pin I'm not pinning you I
am using

384
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,120
am using
 

385
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,509
am using
your

386
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:44,519
your
 

387
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,629
your
resistance to

388
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
resistance to
 

389
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,550
resistance to
trigger tension in the untrained so that

390
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
trigger tension in the untrained so that
 

391
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,230
trigger tension in the untrained so that
I can practice the trained response

392
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
I can practice the trained response
 

393
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,590
I can practice the trained response
which is drop and SN the cheek okay

394
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,600

 

395
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,949

um so we've left the C the pure

396
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
um so we've left the C the pure
 

397
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,470
um so we've left the C the pure
cultivation fields of the C set for

398
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,480
cultivation fields of the C set for
 

399
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,990
cultivation fields of the C set for
example the I

400
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
example the I
 

401
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,470
example the I
set um they're simplified fields and

402
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
set um they're simplified fields and
 

403
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,629
set um they're simplified fields and
simplified in what way there's no mind

404
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
simplified in what way there's no mind
 

405
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,949
simplified in what way there's no mind
to them that that's what there's no M

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,110
objective okay now that's a
lot that's three more factors that are

446
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
lot that's three more factors that are
 

447
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,829
lot that's three more factors that are
interrelated that you put into this so I

448
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:24,839
interrelated that you put into this so I
 

449
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,910
interrelated that you put into this so I
don't really consider this as good a

450
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:26,920
don't really consider this as good a
 

451
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,550
don't really consider this as good a
cultivation field as the

452
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:29,560
cultivation field as the
 

453
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,430
cultivation field as the
C set or the I set you're you're trying

454
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
C set or the I set you're you're trying
 

455
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,230
C set or the I set you're you're trying
to now take what you've learned in the

456
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,240
to now take what you've learned in the
 

457
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,389
to now take what you've learned in the
cultivation sets and add other things to

458
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:39,399
cultivation sets and add other things to
 

459
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,430
cultivation sets and add other things to
them my okay so when you add

460
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
them my okay so when you add
 

461
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,470
them my okay so when you add
my even though this looks pretty simple

462
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
my even though this looks pretty simple
 

463
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,710
my even though this looks pretty simple
and looks very much like

464
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:51,720
and looks very much like
 

465
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,110
and looks very much like
uh a cultivation field as in the koku

466
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,120
uh a cultivation field as in the koku
 

467
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,030
uh a cultivation field as in the koku
set or the II

468
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040
set or the II
 

469
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,189
set or the II
set it's not it's much closer to how EO

470
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:02,199
set it's not it's much closer to how EO
 

471
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,189
set it's not it's much closer to how EO
is or Shon like other

472
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
is or Shon like other
 

473
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,150
is or Shon like other
Kona and so it should be more consistent

474
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
Kona and so it should be more consistent
 

475
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,790
Kona and so it should be more consistent
with those kihon waza and something that

476
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
with those kihon waza and something that
 

477
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,910
with those kihon waza and something that
is consistent with that kihon waza in

478
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
is consistent with that kihon waza in
 

479
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,189
is consistent with that kihon waza in
terms of what my is is your angle of

480
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
terms of what my is is your angle of
 

481
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,470
terms of what my is is your angle of
deviation you have to have an angle of

482
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,480
deviation you have to have an angle of
 

483
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,550
deviation you have to have an angle of
deviation but yet here in this kofu hole

484
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:23,560
deviation but yet here in this kofu hole
 

485
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,430
deviation but yet here in this kofu hole
it looks like there's no angle deviation

486
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,440
it looks like there's no angle deviation
 

487
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,150
it looks like there's no angle deviation
but it's not true there is okay

488
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
but it's not true there is okay
 

489
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,550
but it's not true there is okay
um and that that th that angle is

490
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
um and that that th that angle is
 

491
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,269
um and that that th that angle is
connected in the qua movement okay so if

492
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:38,279
connected in the qua movement okay so if
 

493
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,749
connected in the qua movement okay so if
you look

494
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
you look
 

495
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,710
you look
at the relationship between my spine and

496
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
at the relationship between my spine and
 

497
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,470
at the relationship between my spine and
Sean's spine our noses here when I when

498
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
Sean's spine our noses here when I when
 

499
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,910
Sean's spine our noses here when I when
I open or close one claw you see how I'm

500
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:52,920
I open or close one claw you see how I'm
 

501
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,030
I open or close one claw you see how I'm
moving off the line of the T you see so

502
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
moving off the line of the T you see so
 

503
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,590
moving off the line of the T you see so
he comes to punch me in the nose right

504
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
he comes to punch me in the nose right
 

505
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,710
he comes to punch me in the nose right
and I that was enough then that's enough

506
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
and I that was enough then that's enough
 

507
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,309
and I that was enough then that's enough
for me to miss so I'll redo my quaw undo

508
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:11,319
for me to miss so I'll redo my quaw undo
 

509
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,309
for me to miss so I'll redo my quaw undo
my quaw and you see that's that's dead

510
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:14,319

wom and then V Okay so that makes this
 

535
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,760
wom and then V Okay so that makes this
movement one

536
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:02,770

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,150
basically winding
up that movement right

546
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
up that movement right

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,909
up that movement right
okay yes you're working on the quaw but

548
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:24,919
okay yes you're working on the quaw but
 

549
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,110
okay yes you're working on the quaw but
the quaw here because it's not a

generating your angle

554
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
generating your angle
 

555
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,110
generating your angle
deviation that your

556
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,120
deviation that your
 

557
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,669
deviation that your
tesak is you see how we've moved you

558
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
tesak is you see how we've moved you
 

559
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:45,270
tesak is you see how we've moved you
went left I went right

560
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280

 

561
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,549

okay and that's how that's what you're

562
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:47,559
okay and that's how that's what you're
 

563
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,350
okay and that's how that's what you're
seeing margar is that big

564
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360

 

565
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,190

movement okay but think of it as as and

566
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,200
movement okay but think of it as as and
 

567
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,789
movement okay but think of it as as and
and you mentioned that you get kind of

568
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
and you mentioned that you get kind of
 

569
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,630
and you mentioned that you get kind of
squeezed you see so here here I am

570
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
squeezed you see so here here I am
 

571
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,870
squeezed you see so here here I am
squeezed okay but if I just could move

572
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
squeezed okay but if I just could move
 

573
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,510
squeezed okay but if I just could move
this over I not squeez you see that even

574
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:12,520
this over I not squeez you see that even
 

575
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,950
this over I not squeez you see that even
though this is close to me it doesn't

576
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
though this is close to me it doesn't
 

577
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,149
though this is close to me it doesn't
really have anything on it you

578
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:18,159
really have anything on it you
 

579
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,830
really have anything on it you
see like if you before you get squeezed

580
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
see like if you before you get squeezed
 

581
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,070
see like if you before you get squeezed
if you moved off the line then there's

582
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,080
if you moved off the line then there's
 

583
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,750
if you moved off the line then there's
nothing on it you wouldn't have got

584
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:26,760
nothing on it you wouldn't have got
 

585
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,549
nothing on it you wouldn't have got
squeez you got squeeze CU you stayed on

586
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
squeez you got squeeze CU you stayed on
 

587
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,710
squeez you got squeeze CU you stayed on
the line okay and you didn't deviate you

588
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
the line okay and you didn't deviate you
 

589
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,549
the line okay and you didn't deviate you
didn't have the angle of deviation that

590
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
didn't have the angle of deviation that
 

591
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,430
didn't have the angle of deviation that
is built into the qua utilization in the

592
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,440
is built into the qua utilization in the
 

593
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,190
is built into the qua utilization in the
technique okay so let's try that bring

594
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
technique okay so let's try that bring
 

595
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
technique okay so let's try that bring
attention to that
