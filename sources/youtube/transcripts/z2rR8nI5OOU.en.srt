small when I bring this back the
 

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,670
small when I bring this back the
distance is Big you see and now there's

112
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:32,680
distance is Big you see and now there's
 

113
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,750
distance is Big you see and now there's
room for the hand a lot of times people

we're going to make sure we fix that and
 

123
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,789
we're going to make sure we fix that and
then we'll continue with correction

124
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
then we'll continue with correction
 

125
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,670

quickly but it is very good to have the
 

135
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,869
quickly but it is very good to have the
technique that I

136

showed
 

139
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,069
showed
here on this technique on when we did

140
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:15,079
here on this technique on when we did
 

141
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,030
here on this technique on when we did
the YouTube video on this one I showed

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
don't know how to do this because it's
 

199
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,950
don't know how to do this because it's
wrong we don't do it but I have had many

200
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:03,960
wrong we don't do it but I have had many
 

201
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,390
wrong we don't do it but I have had many
videos on

202
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,400
videos on
 

203
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,990
videos on
this that you cannot rotate your hips

204
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
this that you cannot rotate your hips
 

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,550
this that you cannot rotate your hips
most commonly in

206
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
most commonly in
 

207
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,309
most commonly in
Tenon

208
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:15,319
Tenon
 

209
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,029
Tenon
uh in a way that the reactionary force

210
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
uh in a way that the reactionary force
 

211
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,950
uh in a way that the reactionary force
is going to cut through your shikaku you

212
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
is going to cut through your shikaku you
 

213
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,350
is going to cut through your shikaku you
will lose balance okay so some common

214
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,360
will lose balance okay so some common
 

215
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,029
will lose balance okay so some common
ones is when the

216
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:32,039

 

217
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,790

the the N let me do it on this

218
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
the the N let me do it on this
 

219
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,790
the the N let me do it on this
side the

220
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
side the
 

221
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,309
side the
N is turning him on that ten con okay

222
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
N is turning him on that ten con okay
 

223
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,830
N is turning him on that ten con okay
or another one is where they go here and

224
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:48,840
or another one is where they go here and
 

225
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,029
or another one is where they go here and
turn here okay it doesn't matter if you

226
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
turn here okay it doesn't matter if you
 

227
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,830
turn here okay it doesn't matter if you
hop or you put your feet right or you

228
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
hop or you put your feet right or you
 

229
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,350
hop or you put your feet right or you
bend your knees all that is crap okay so

bend your knees all that is crap okay so
 

231
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,710
bend your knees all that is crap okay so
um the first one I want you to try is

232
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
um the first one I want you to try is
 

233
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,909
um the first one I want you to try is
where you try to turn me on the T okay

234
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
where you try to turn me on the T okay
 

235
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,950
where you try to turn me on the T okay
so let me just see if Taylor can do this

236
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
so let me just see if Taylor can do this
 

237
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,469
so let me just see if Taylor can do this
you're going to turn me on the T there

238
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:17,479
you're going to turn me on the T there
 

239
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,589
you're going to turn me on the T there
you go

240
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:20,599

 

241
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,430

okay so he

242
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440

 

243
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,309

goes and he can't he's not going to turn

244
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
goes and he can't he's not going to turn
 

245
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,469
goes and he can't he's not going to turn
me because the reaction Force cuts

246
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
me because the reaction Force cuts
 

247
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,710
me because the reaction Force cuts
through the middle of his two feet which

248
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
through the middle of his two feet which
 

249
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,510
through the middle of his two feet which
is shikaku and he's going to lose

250
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
is shikaku and he's going to lose
 

251
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,070
is shikaku and he's going to lose
balance okay the next one I want you to

252
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
balance okay the next one I want you to
 

253
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,629
balance okay the next one I want you to
do is don't turn me here but then come

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
do is don't turn me here but then come
 

255
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,070
do is don't turn me here but then come
forward and then turn me on this T

256
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
forward and then turn me on this T
 

257
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,070
forward and then turn me on this T
okay let me see if you can do it 10 con

258
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
okay let me see if you can do it 10 con
 

259
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,869
okay let me see if you can do it 10 con
10 con no and 10 con good then you go

260
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:55,879
10 con no and 10 con good then you go
 

261
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,990
10 con no and 10 con good then you go
forward and 10 con to turn you

262
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,000

 

263
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,990

okay There He

264
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000

 

265
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,230

Go

Okay
 

269
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,909
Okay
um this is a no no this does not work

270
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
um this is a no no this does not work
 

271
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,189
um this is a no no this does not work
okay

272
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:20,199
okay
 

273
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,790
okay
um so this this comes from people think

274
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
um so this this comes from people think
 

275
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,589
um so this this comes from people think
that iido is working through hip

276
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:28,599
that iido is working through hip
 

277
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,869
that iido is working through hip
rotation and they're like look you

278
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
rotation and they're like look you
 

279
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,630
rotation and they're like look you
rotated your hip look your emian your

280
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
rotated your hip look your emian your
 

281
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,389
rotated your hip look your emian your
Tenon you rotated your hips a lot it

282
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
Tenon you rotated your hips a lot it
 

283
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,230
Tenon you rotated your hips a lot it
does not come from hip rotation it it

284
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,240
does not come from hip rotation it it
 

285
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,389
does not come from hip rotation it it
comes from the qua uh Andrew's

286
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:43,399
comes from the qua uh Andrew's
 

287
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,630
comes from the qua uh Andrew's
15° okay that that's all you get that is

288
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:47,640
15° okay that that's all you get that is
 

289
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,829
15° okay that that's all you get that is
it it's here it's not my hips moving

290
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
it it's here it's not my hips moving
 

291
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,150
it it's here it's not my hips moving
through

292
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,160
through
 

293
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,550
through
space doesn't do that that hip that hip

294
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
space doesn't do that that hip that hip
 

295
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,990
space doesn't do that that hip that hip
rotation will always generate through

296
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
rotation will always generate through
 

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,069
rotation will always generate through
reactionary Force Through the middle of

298
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:02,079
reactionary Force Through the middle of
 

299
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,150
reactionary Force Through the middle of
his two feet that's the shikaku and you

300
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,160
his two feet that's the shikaku and you
 

301
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,710
his two feet that's the shikaku and you
will lose your balance

302
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:07,720
will lose your balance
 

303
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,430
will lose your balance
okay

304
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
okay
 

305
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,670
okay
so in this

306
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
so in this
 

307
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,910
so in this
technique you're not

308
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:14,920
technique you're not
 

309
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,910
technique you're not
going

310
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
going
 

311
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,710
going
here that would be

312
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
here that would be
 

313
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,990
here that would be
wrong but you're also not

314
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,000
wrong but you're also not
 

315
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,590
wrong but you're also not
going here that's wrong too that that

316
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
going here that's wrong too that that
 

317
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,030
going here that's wrong too that that
only works on the person who's going to

318
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
only works on the person who's going to
 

319
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,829
only works on the person who's going to
go with you and this technique is for

320
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
go with you and this technique is for
 

321
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,949
go with you and this technique is for
the UK who's not going with you okay the

322
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
the UK who's not going with you okay the
 

323
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,389
the UK who's not going with you okay the
person that doesn't have spinal

324
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
person that doesn't have spinal
 

325
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,310
person that doesn't have spinal
displacement that's going flying past

326
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
displacement that's going flying past
 

327
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,030
displacement that's going flying past
you okay all right

328
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
you okay all right
 

329
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,470
you okay all right
so uh let's watch

330
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:47,480

 

331
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,509

something

332
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
something
 

333
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,910
something
uh when I

334
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
uh when I
 

335
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,710
uh when I
move from where my hands can both touch

336
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
move from where my hands can both touch
 

337
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,990
move from where my hands can both touch
what I'm touching so the wui line the

338
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
what I'm touching so the wui line the
 

339
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,389
what I'm touching so the wui line the
W can make

340
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
W can make
 

341
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,110
W can make
up that 15° but if you pay

342
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
up that 15° but if you pay
 

343
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,150
up that 15° but if you pay
attention that meant the wui line moved

344
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
attention that meant the wui line moved
 

345
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,990
attention that meant the wui line moved
you see that I won't ever go here

346
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
you see that I won't ever go here
 

347
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,389
you see that I won't ever go here
okay this technique like every other

348
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:17,399
okay this technique like every other
 

349
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,870
okay this technique like every other
iida technique keeps on the wuji

350
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880

 

351
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,230

line for his power so when uh let's say

352
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
line for his power so when uh let's say
 

353
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,389
line for his power so when uh let's say
he's pushing now's he's doing spinal

354
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
he's pushing now's he's doing spinal
 

355
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,790
he's pushing now's he's doing spinal
displacement

356
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
displacement
 

357
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,230
displacement
okay and I know I want to touch with

358
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,240
okay and I know I want to touch with
 

359
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,069
okay and I know I want to touch with
this hand then I have to move to put

360
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
this hand then I have to move to put
 

361
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,750
this hand then I have to move to put
those this whole mechanism on the wui

362
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
those this whole mechanism on the wui
 

363
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,110
those this whole mechanism on the wui
line okay now when I do the throw I

364
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
line okay now when I do the throw I
 

365
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,790
line okay now when I do the throw I
don't want to bring it off the wui

366
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:53,800
don't want to bring it off the wui
 

367
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,190
don't want to bring it off the wui
line no matter how I do that cuz here I

368
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,200
line no matter how I do that cuz here I
 

369
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,230
line no matter how I do that cuz here I
am not strong

370
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
am not strong
 

371
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,230
am not strong
okay

372
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
okay
 

373
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,829
okay
so

374
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839

 

375
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,310

resist I am not strong there

376
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
resist I am not strong there
 

377
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,389
resist I am not strong there
okay um I am only strong or

378
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:15,399
okay um I am only strong or
 

379
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,990
okay um I am only strong or
strongest on the wui

380
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
strongest on the wui
 

381
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,910
strongest on the wui
line when we use the qua which some

382
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:20,920
line when we use the qua which some
 

383
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,590
line when we use the qua which some
people think is hip

384
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
people think is hip
 

385
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,269
people think is hip
rotation the whole mechanism moves with

386
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
rotation the whole mechanism moves with
 

387
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,230
rotation the whole mechanism moves with
the wui line boom

388
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
the wui line boom
 

389
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,110
the wui line boom
okay does that make sense my hands this

390
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
okay does that make sense my hands this
 

391
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,590
okay does that make sense my hands this
mechanism does not go left and right of

392
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
mechanism does not go left and right of
 

393
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,190
mechanism does not go left and right of
the wui line nor is there some hip

394
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
the wui line nor is there some hip
 

395
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,389
the wui line nor is there some hip
rotation that's doing this

396
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
rotation that's doing this
 

397
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,829
rotation that's doing this
okay so if you pay attention no matter

398
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
okay so if you pay attention no matter
 

399
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,910
okay so if you pay attention no matter
what I'm doing on this

400
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
what I'm doing on this
 

401
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,870
what I'm doing on this
technique it is on that wui line okay

402
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
technique it is on that wui line okay
 

403
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,629
technique it is on that wui line okay
every single

404
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
every single
 

405
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,110
every single
time here stay when I move here if I

406
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,120
time here stay when I move here if I
 

407
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,350
time here stay when I move here if I
need to it's cuz I need the wui line to

408
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
need to it's cuz I need the wui line to
 

409
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,509
need to it's cuz I need the wui line to
move here but he doesn't he's not

410
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:10,519
move here but he doesn't he's not
 

411
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,269
move here but he doesn't he's not
doing

412
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:12,279
doing
 

413
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,509
doing
that and I haven't really rotated my

414
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
that and I haven't really rotated my
 

415
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,350
that and I haven't really rotated my
hips so resist that pull you see and I'm

416
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,360
hips so resist that pull you see and I'm
 

417
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,949
hips so resist that pull you see and I'm
just grounding this foot and I

418
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
just grounding this foot and I
 

419
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,509
just grounding this foot and I
move does that make sense that is

420
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
move does that make sense that is
 

421
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,350
move does that make sense that is
different from resist and I'm trying to

422
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
different from resist and I'm trying to
 

423
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,750
different from resist and I'm trying to
bring him around like that I cannot do

424
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
bring him around like that I cannot do
 

425
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,389
bring him around like that I cannot do
that okay so this may look like a ten

426
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:37,399
that okay so this may look like a ten
 

427
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,629
that okay so this may look like a ten
con but if you pay attention my

428
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:41,639
con but if you pay attention my
 

429
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,509
con but if you pay attention my
hips aren't really rotating around each

430
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:44,519
hips aren't really rotating around each
 

431
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,030
hips aren't really rotating around each
other here's where the technique

432
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040

 

433
00:12:50,040 --> 00:13:06,829

is room

434
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:06,839

 

435
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,509

no okay let's try keep the technique

436
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:10,519
no okay let's try keep the technique
 

437
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,230
no okay let's try keep the technique
here the entire time okay all right so

438
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,240
here the entire time okay all right so
 

439
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,509
here the entire time okay all right so
the

440
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519

 

441
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,350

pin down and we're here okay

442
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
pin down and we're here okay
 

443
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,110
pin down and we're here okay
so here uh I have the arm

444
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,120
so here uh I have the arm
 

445
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,150
so here uh I have the arm
vent I don't have this thing like this

446
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
vent I don't have this thing like this
 

447
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,910
vent I don't have this thing like this
okay now I know if he stays

448
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
okay now I know if he stays
 

449
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,389
okay now I know if he stays
there uh I can get this EO right here

450
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:41,399
there uh I can get this EO right here
 

451
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,590
there uh I can get this EO right here
okay and I know if he stays there I can

452
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:44,600
okay and I know if he stays there I can
 

453
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,670
okay and I know if he stays there I can
get that elbow but the the problem

454
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:48,680
get that elbow but the the problem
 

455
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,269
get that elbow but the the problem
is that he doesn't have to stay there he

456
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
is that he doesn't have to stay there he
 

457
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,470
is that he doesn't have to stay there he
can Shuffle

458
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
can Shuffle
 

459
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,790
can Shuffle
forward and I lose that okay so go back

460
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:57,800
forward and I lose that okay so go back
 

461
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,710
forward and I lose that okay so go back
to my point that the iido pins are not

462
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
to my point that the iido pins are not
 

463
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,189
to my point that the iido pins are not
pins okay they're not

464
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
pins okay they're not
 

465
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,110
pins okay they're not
pins um and this one's not a

466
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
pins um and this one's not a
 

467
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,150
pins um and this one's not a
pin I'm here like this

468
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,160
pin I'm here like this
 

469
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,590
pin I'm here like this
okay there's my this is what I

470
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
okay there's my this is what I
 

471
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,389
okay there's my this is what I
want and then I'm going to attack what I

472
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:19,399
want and then I'm going to attack what I
 

473
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,509
want and then I'm going to attack what I
call the scapula mechanism there's going

474
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
call the scapula mechanism there's going
 

475
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,269
call the scapula mechanism there's going
to be immense weight

476
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:24,279
to be immense weight
 

477
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,150
to be immense weight
here

478
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
here
 

479
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,790
here
shoving down that way

480
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:29,800
shoving down that way
 

481
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,949
shoving down that way
I want that pin or that pressure to take

482
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:33,959
I want that pin or that pressure to take
 

483
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,949
I want that pin or that pressure to take
slack out so look at all the slack I

484
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
slack out so look at all the slack I
 

485
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,189
slack out so look at all the slack I
want it

486
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:38,199
want it
 

487
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,790
want it
gone now when I move his arm this way

488
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:43,800
gone now when I move his arm this way
 

489
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,030
gone now when I move his arm this way
he'll feel it

490
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
he'll feel it
 

491
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,590
he'll feel it
immediately so tap when you don't like

492
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
immediately so tap when you don't like
 

493
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,150
immediately so tap when you don't like
it that's how much movement I could get

494
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
it that's how much movement I could get
 

495
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,110
it that's how much movement I could get
out of it okay um so that

496
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
out of it okay um so that
 

497
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,350
out of it okay um so that
means that when I go let's do the

498
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
means that when I go let's do the
 

499
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,030
means that when I go let's do the
technique

500
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040

 

501
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,430

here when I'm

502
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440

 

503
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,790

here that's that technique there's no

504
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:13,800
here that's that technique there's no
 

505
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,949
here that's that technique there's no
time for him to go forward okay that's

506
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
time for him to go forward okay that's
 

507
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,990
time for him to go forward okay that's
what I'm doing so keep that in

508
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
what I'm doing so keep that in
 

509
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,389
what I'm doing so keep that in
mind that it's not a

510
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:25,399
mind that it's not a
 

511
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,110
mind that it's not a
pin it's a dislocation

512
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
pin it's a dislocation
 

513
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,829
pin it's a dislocation
okay that's what you're trying to

514
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
okay that's what you're trying to
 

515
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,629
okay that's what you're trying to
do

516
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:33,639
do
 

517
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,150
do
um

518
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
um
 

519
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,350
um
secondarily note

520
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,360
secondarily note
 

521
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,550
secondarily note
how his tapping

522
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
how his tapping
 

523
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,150
how his tapping
signal is pre perceptible movement to

524
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
signal is pre perceptible movement to
 

525
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,949
signal is pre perceptible movement to
anybody out there and that is telling

526
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
anybody out there and that is telling
 

527
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,749
anybody out there and that is telling
you that he's already at the cusp of

528
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:52,759
you that he's already at the cusp of
 

529
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,829
you that he's already at the cusp of
this

530
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
this
 

531
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,590
this
location so when we're

532
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,600
location so when we're
 

533
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,430
location so when we're
here like this okay he's not at the

534
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,440
here like this okay he's not at the
 

535
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,110
here like this okay he's not at the
cusp you see how long that took to get

536
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
cusp you see how long that took to get
 

537
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,309
cusp you see how long that took to get
there

538
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:06,319
there
 

539
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,590
there
okay so that's not

540
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
okay so that's not
 

541
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,550
okay so that's not
correct uh the other the next point

542
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
correct uh the other the next point
 

543
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,030
correct uh the other the next point
about this is not its

544
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,040
about this is not its
 

545
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,470
about this is not its
immediatey but what is my actual range

546
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:19,480
immediatey but what is my actual range
 

547
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,670
immediatey but what is my actual range
of motion towards the dislocation it's

548
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:22,680
of motion towards the dislocation it's
 

549
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,069
of motion towards the dislocation it's
related so if he's already at the

550
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,079
related so if he's already at the
 

551
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,790
related so if he's already at the
cusp and I have the

552
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:29,800
cusp and I have the
 

553
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,670
cusp and I have the
ability to not only move to the

554
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
ability to not only move to the
 

555
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,389
ability to not only move to the
cusp but weigh the F down there that

556
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:37,399
cusp but weigh the F down there that
 

557
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,629
cusp but weigh the F down there that
thing's

558
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
thing's
 

559
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,550
thing's
dislocated if my ability I get I don't

560
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
dislocated if my ability I get I don't
 

561
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,910
dislocated if my ability I get I don't
get to the cusp it's not dislocated if I

562
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
get to the cusp it's not dislocated if I
 

563
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,829
get to the cusp it's not dislocated if I
can only get to the cusp it's not

564
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
can only get to the cusp it's not
 

565
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,710
can only get to the cusp it's not
dislocated if I get a little past the

566
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:51,720
dislocated if I get a little past the
 

567
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,749
dislocated if I get a little past the
cusp it might be dislocated okay it need

568
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
cusp it might be dislocated okay it need
 

569
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,829
cusp it might be dislocated okay it need
to be way down there so if we are

570
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:00,839
to be way down there so if we are
 

571
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,549
to be way down there so if we are
here and I won't get it in place but you

572
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
here and I won't get it in place but you
 

573
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,630
here and I won't get it in place but you
can

574
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:07,640
can
 

575
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,350
can
see how far I can move from where I

576
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,360
see how far I can move from where I
 

577
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,590
see how far I can move from where I
didn't move at all so here is where the

578
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
didn't move at all so here is where the
 

579
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,429
didn't move at all so here is where the
cus was and I moved my hands and my

580
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
cus was and I moved my hands and my
 

581
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,669
cus was and I moved my hands and my
Center a good foot and a half more that

582
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
Center a good foot and a half more that
 

583
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,909
Center a good foot and a half more that
thing's coming off

584
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:26,919
thing's coming off
 

585
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,830
thing's coming off
okay if we look at

586
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
okay if we look at
 

587
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,750
okay if we look at
this okay and I'm doing this

588
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
this okay and I'm doing this
 

589
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,950
this okay and I'm doing this
one I'm I am not the cusp of my wrist

590
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:37,960
one I'm I am not the cusp of my wrist
 

591
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,029

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
movement if you pay attention right you
 

593
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,750
movement if you pay attention right you
see and I am at the cusp of my energy

594
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:44,760
see and I am at the cusp of my energy
 

595
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,230
see and I am at the cusp of my energy
output he's strong strong enough on me

596
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,240
output he's strong strong enough on me
 

597
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,390
output he's strong strong enough on me
to actually Force his wrist back

598
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,400
to actually Force his wrist back
 

599
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,029
to actually Force his wrist back
up okay if he combines that with

600
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
up okay if he combines that with
 

601
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,070
up okay if he combines that with
if he combines that with moving forward

602
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
if he combines that with moving forward
 

603
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,750
if he combines that with moving forward
it's easy peasy to get out okay

604
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:06,760
it's easy peasy to get out okay
 

605
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,830
it's easy peasy to get out okay
so adopt the pin that we had and not a

606
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
so adopt the pin that we had and not a
 

607
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,190
so adopt the pin that we had and not a
ferite pin where they tap your pins have

608
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,200
ferite pin where they tap your pins have
 

609
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,149
ferite pin where they tap your pins have
to well better said your

610
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:19,159
to well better said your
 

611
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,630
to well better said your
dislocations have to feel like there is

612
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,640
dislocations have to feel like there is
 

613
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,830
dislocations have to feel like there is
no way I can't rip this Lim off they

614
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
no way I can't rip this Lim off they
 

615
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,870
no way I can't rip this Lim off they
cannot be just a guy tapped out

616
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:31,880
cannot be just a guy tapped out
 

617
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,630
cannot be just a guy tapped out
eventually because it was the OE on him

618
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:35,640
eventually because it was the OE on him
 

619
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,909
eventually because it was the OE on him
okay you that's not it at all okay um

620
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
okay you that's not it at all okay um
 

621
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,230
okay you that's not it at all okay um
there's a lot of people that cannot take

622
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,240
there's a lot of people that cannot take
 

623
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,310
there's a lot of people that cannot take
pain they're in

624
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:45,320
pain they're in
 

625
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,029
pain they're in
iido right so they're going to tap out

626
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,039
iido right so they're going to tap out
 

627
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,830
iido right so they're going to tap out
super early you you don't judge by that

628
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
super early you you don't judge by that
 

629
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,669
super early you you don't judge by that
crowd tapping out you judge by the

630
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:54,679
crowd tapping out you judge by the
 

631
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,270
crowd tapping out you judge by the
mechanics do you have the joint

632
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,280
mechanics do you have the joint
 

633
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,310
mechanics do you have the joint
compromise

634
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
compromise
 

635
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,110
compromise
to such a degree in light of what your

636
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,120
to such a degree in light of what your
 

637
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,390
to such a degree in light of what your
range of motion is and your potential

638
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
range of motion is and your potential
 

639
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,029

power output that you can rip it off yes

640
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
power output that you can rip it off yes
 

641
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,430
power output that you can rip it off yes
or no you don't need the tap to tell you

642
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
or no you don't need the tap to tell you
 

643
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,870
or no you don't need the tap to tell you
that okay I don't pay attention to the

644
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
that okay I don't pay attention to the
 

645
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,510
that okay I don't pay attention to the
tap if you if you pay attention a lot of

646
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:14,520
tap if you if you pay attention a lot of
 

647
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,110
tap if you if you pay attention a lot of
times I already started the next rep

648
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
times I already started the next rep
 

649
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,270
times I already started the next rep
before they tap because I knew all the

650
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
before they tap because I knew all the
 

651
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,710
before they tap because I knew all the
mechanics were in place to do whatever I
