00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,510
of this you know there's me thinking
that

74
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
that
 

75
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,990

88
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
you to give a hundred percent
 

89
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,389

unless i do it through technique

290

unless i do it through technique
 

291
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,070
unless i do it through technique
so the technique would be

292
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
so the technique would be
 

293
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,870
so the technique would be
to

the technique would

298
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
the technique would
 

299
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:27,189
the technique would
be from the rear

300
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199

 

301
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,390

but your mind may not be fooled enough
 

685
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,750
but your mind may not be fooled enough
thinking

686
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
thinking
 

687
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,350
thinking
or even

688
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
or even
 

689
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,389
or even
mad enough to think it

690
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399

 

691
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,790

let's say that you're

692
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
let's say that you're
 

693
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,470
let's say that you're
a cat

694
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
a cat
 

695
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,430
a cat
a mouse

696
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440

 

697
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,870

let's say that the scientists tell us

698
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
let's say that the scientists tell us
 

699
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,509
let's say that the scientists tell us
that we are just matter

700
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
that we are just matter
 

701
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,829
that we are just matter
where

702
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
where
 

703
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,389
where
particles when i feel my myself i feel

704
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
particles when i feel my myself i feel
 

705
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,430
particles when i feel my myself i feel
solid

706
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
solid
 

707
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,069
solid
so it's very difficult for me to

708
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
so it's very difficult for me to
 

709
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,590
so it's very difficult for me to
believe

710

713
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,910

to me that something like

714
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
to me that something like
 

715
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,150
to me that something like
is there an end to the universe it's

716
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
is there an end to the universe it's
 

717
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,990
is there an end to the universe it's
more than my mind can

718
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
more than my mind can
 

719
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,150
more than my mind can
take in and accept

720
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160

 

721
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,350

but let's just for a moment say okay so

722
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
but let's just for a moment say okay so
 

723
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,470
but let's just for a moment say okay so
i'm really

724
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
i'm really
 

725
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,310
i'm really
just a load of particles

726
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320

 

727
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,069

say i'm a mouse

728
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
say i'm a mouse
 

729
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,430
say i'm a mouse
and i need to get under a door

730
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
and i need to get under a door
 

731
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,710
and i need to get under a door
and the door

732
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
and the door
 

733
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,590
and the door
has

734
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
has
 

735
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,389
has
that's a centimeter

736
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
that's a centimeter
 

737
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,230
that's a centimeter
of space

738
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
of space
 

739
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,389
of space
i don't know how much a mouse really

740
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
i don't know how much a mouse really
 

741
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,629
i don't know how much a mouse really
needs but let's just for just for this

742
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
needs but let's just for just for this
 

743
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,870
needs but let's just for just for this
film

744
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
film
 

745
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,670
film
how does that mouse what is the same as

746
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
how does that mouse what is the same as
 

747
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,870
how does that mouse what is the same as
you and me

748
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
you and me
 

749
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,150
you and me
got bone structure

750
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
got bone structure
 

751
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,189
got bone structure
and if

752
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
and if
 

753
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,590
and if
let's say

754
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
let's say
 

755
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,870
let's say
one died

756
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
one died
 

757
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,069
one died
decomposed

758
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079

 

759
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,430

you would be left with a skeleton

760
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
you would be left with a skeleton
 

761
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,870
you would be left with a skeleton
and the skeleton would be in one solid

762
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
and the skeleton would be in one solid
 

763
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,710
and the skeleton would be in one solid
piece one frame

764
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720

 

765
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,230

and the frame would show its head

766
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
and the frame would show its head
 

767
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,269
and the frame would show its head
neck

768
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
neck
 

769
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,310
neck
and then it's large body tailing off

770
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320

 

771
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,189

if you're looking at it from a side view

772
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
if you're looking at it from a side view
 

773
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,470
if you're looking at it from a side view
and yet it's the the side view

774
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
and yet it's the the side view
 

775
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,150
and yet it's the the side view
that that mouse

776
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
that that mouse
 

777
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,749
that that mouse
collapses

778
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
collapses
 

779
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,430
collapses
it doesn't

780
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
it doesn't
 

781
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,910
it doesn't
tip itself on its side doesn't keep its

782
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
tip itself on its side doesn't keep its
 

783
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,749
tip itself on its side doesn't keep its
neck straight

784
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
neck straight
 

785
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,069
neck straight
it just

786
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
it just
 

787
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,749
it just
goes down

788
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
goes down
 

789
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,150
goes down
through the other side

790
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
through the other side
 

791
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,429
through the other side
comes back to normal size

792
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
comes back to normal size
 

793
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,510
comes back to normal size
and a cat does it as well

794
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
and a cat does it as well
 

795
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,669
and a cat does it as well
and you may know this

796
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
and you may know this
 

797
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,029
and you may know this
but i've never thought about it

798
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
but i've never thought about it
 

799
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,949
but i've never thought about it
so what i decided to do many years ago

800
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
so what i decided to do many years ago
 

801
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,270
so what i decided to do many years ago
was to go through different stages to

802
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
was to go through different stages to
 

803
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,870
was to go through different stages to
find where i

804
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
find where i
 

805
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,270
find where i
where i am at now

806
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280

 

807
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,189

and this is what i'm hoping this is a

808
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
and this is what i'm hoping this is a
 

809
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,309
and this is what i'm hoping this is a
real

810
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
real
 

811
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,870
real
secret but it's whether your mind will

812
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
secret but it's whether your mind will
 

813
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,750
secret but it's whether your mind will
allow you to understand it

814
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
allow you to understand it
 

815
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,310
allow you to understand it
that's the question

816
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
that's the question
 

817
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,110
that's the question
so the question

818
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
so the question
 

819
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,789
so the question
will take time

820
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
will take time
 

821
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,590
will take time
to get an answer and the answer may

822
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
to get an answer and the answer may
 

823
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,630
to get an answer and the answer may
never come because your mind

824
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
never come because your mind
 

825
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,430
never come because your mind
may

826
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
may
 

827
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,510
may
it may allude you to

828
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
it may allude you to
 

829
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,070
it may allude you to
find the answer because you can't

830
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
find the answer because you can't
 

831
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,990
find the answer because you can't
believe that where's the end of the

832
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
believe that where's the end of the
 

833
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,430
believe that where's the end of the
universe

834
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
universe
 

835
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,830
universe
you know your mind will not allow you to

836
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
you know your mind will not allow you to
 

837
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,430
you know your mind will not allow you to
compromise and

838
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
compromise and
 

839
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,990
compromise and
go into

840
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000

 

841
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,549

a weird way of thinking

842
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
a weird way of thinking
 

843
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,750
a weird way of thinking
so when

844
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
so when
 

845
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,390
so when
i tried over the years at first

846
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
i tried over the years at first
 

847
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,029
i tried over the years at first
i was really powerful and strong

848
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
i was really powerful and strong
 

849
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,750
i was really powerful and strong
so it doesn't matter who held me

850
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
so it doesn't matter who held me
 

851
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,390
so it doesn't matter who held me
very rarely anywhere in the world

852
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
very rarely anywhere in the world
 

853
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,630
very rarely anywhere in the world
one or two people could

854
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
one or two people could
 

855
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,710
one or two people could
and i just i can't do it

856
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
and i just i can't do it
 

857
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,110
and i just i can't do it
and gave up

858
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
and gave up
 

859
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,950
and gave up
as they got better

860
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
as they got better
 

861
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,150
as they got better
i learn tricks and the tricks are as

862
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
i learn tricks and the tricks are as
 

863
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,669
i learn tricks and the tricks are as
they come to

864
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
they come to
 

865
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,789
they come to
squeeze you you puff up

866
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
squeeze you you puff up
 

867
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,870
squeeze you you puff up
and you like a

868

and you like a
 

869
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,830
and you like a
puffer fish you puff up it may be only

870
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
puffer fish you puff up it may be only
 

871
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,430
puffer fish you puff up it may be only
centimeters but you put

872
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
centimeters but you put
 

873
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,870
centimeters but you put
they puff up

874
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
they puff up
 

875
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,710
they puff up
then you think to yourself

876
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
then you think to yourself
 

877
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,029
then you think to yourself
i know i'm cheating but that's the only

878
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
i know i'm cheating but that's the only
 

879
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,029
i know i'm cheating but that's the only
way i can do it

880
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
way i can do it
 

881
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,070
way i can do it
so you try to become more subtle

882
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
so you try to become more subtle
 

883
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,470
so you try to become more subtle
and instead of puffing up you try to

884
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
and instead of puffing up you try to
 

885
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,430
and instead of puffing up you try to
build a wall that your body is not going

886
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
build a wall that your body is not going
 

887
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,870
build a wall that your body is not going
to reduce any more than when they grab

888
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
to reduce any more than when they grab
 

889
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,310
to reduce any more than when they grab
you so

890
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
you so
 

891
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,310
you so
to them they feel a firm body the arms

892
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
to them they feel a firm body the arms
 

893
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,029
to them they feel a firm body the arms
you know the whole thing feels like a

894
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
you know the whole thing feels like a
 

895
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,750
you know the whole thing feels like a
solid lump to them

896
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
solid lump to them
 

897
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,870
solid lump to them
and then

898
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
and then
 

899
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,830
and then
what you would do is you would relax and

900
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
what you would do is you would relax and
 

901
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,150
what you would do is you would relax and
while you relax and

902
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
while you relax and
 

903
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,230
while you relax and
and just relax all your muscles and all

904
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
and just relax all your muscles and all
 

905
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,029
and just relax all your muscles and all
your body that gives you enough time

906
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
your body that gives you enough time
 

907
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,830
your body that gives you enough time
to stamp on their foot

908
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
to stamp on their foot
 

909
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,549
to stamp on their foot
so you stamp relax escape

910
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559

 

911
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,270

so that's the that's the second stage i

912
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
so that's the that's the second stage i
 

913
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,270
so that's the that's the second stage i
went through

914
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
went through
 

915
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,950
went through
um then i thought i'm having to be quick

916
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
um then i thought i'm having to be quick
 

917
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,510
um then i thought i'm having to be quick
enough and some people were out speeding

918
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
enough and some people were out speeding
 

919
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,909
enough and some people were out speeding
me and they were getting

920
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
me and they were getting
 

921
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,909
me and they were getting
before i could

922
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
before i could
 

923
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,390
before i could
relax

924
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
relax
 

925
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,630
relax
and when i went to stamp a couple of

926
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
and when i went to stamp a couple of
 

927
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,950
and when i went to stamp a couple of
times their foot wasn't there they they

928
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
times their foot wasn't there they they
 

929
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,630
times their foot wasn't there they they
worked out that their foot was going to

930
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
worked out that their foot was going to
 

931
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,270
worked out that their foot was going to
be stamped on and they didn't like it

932
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
be stamped on and they didn't like it
 

933
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,149
be stamped on and they didn't like it
so they they move their foot where you

934
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
so they they move their foot where you
 

935
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,070
so they they move their foot where you
can't see behind you without either

936
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
can't see behind you without either
 

937
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,390
can't see behind you without either
looking down or and then you can't see a

938
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
looking down or and then you can't see a
 

939
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,470
looking down or and then you can't see a
lot

940
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
lot
 

941
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,909
lot
and you're going to tear me with the

942
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
and you're going to tear me with the
 

943
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,830
and you're going to tear me with the
buttocks but when a bear hug they're

944
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
buttocks but when a bear hug they're
 

945
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,789
buttocks but when a bear hug they're
holding you so close that their pubic

946
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
holding you so close that their pubic
 

947
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,669
holding you so close that their pubic
bone or stomach is so close to your

948
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
bone or stomach is so close to your
 

949
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,470
bone or stomach is so close to your
buttocks that you can't attempt

950
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
buttocks that you can't attempt
 

951
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,750
buttocks that you can't attempt
to get any

952
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
to get any
 

953
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,549
to get any
atemi from the butter all you do is

954
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
atemi from the butter all you do is
 

955
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,149
atemi from the butter all you do is
bend them

956
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
bend them
 

957
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,190
bend them
but they're still holding you tightly

958
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200

 

959
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,029

so what i now know is from the day we

960
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
so what i now know is from the day we
 

961
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,149
so what i now know is from the day we
held cytosensei against the wall

962
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
held cytosensei against the wall
 

963
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,950
held cytosensei against the wall
he done something different

964
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
he done something different
 

965
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,149
he done something different
and the difference is i now

966
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
and the difference is i now
 

967
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,630
and the difference is i now
have tried various ways

968
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
have tried various ways
 

969
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,350
have tried various ways
somebody will hold my wrist and they may

970
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
somebody will hold my wrist and they may
 

971
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,750
somebody will hold my wrist and they may
find it feels powerful

972
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
find it feels powerful
 

973
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,909
find it feels powerful
and as you get better you often the

974
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
and as you get better you often the
 

975
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,270
and as you get better you often the
wrist you offer them the shape that it's

976
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
wrist you offer them the shape that it's
 

977
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,149
wrist you offer them the shape that it's
alive and dynamic it's actually just

978
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
alive and dynamic it's actually just
 

979
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,430
alive and dynamic it's actually just
open

980
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
open
 

981
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,669
open
that then makes it

982
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
that then makes it
 

983
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,110
that then makes it
more mushy

984
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
more mushy
 

985
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,310
more mushy
so this is called controlled relaxation

986
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320

 

987
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,029

the next stage is when they go to grip

988
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
the next stage is when they go to grip
 

989
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,430
the next stage is when they go to grip
you absorb them in as if

990
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
you absorb them in as if
 

991
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,909
you absorb them in as if
you're sucking a drink out of a straw as

992
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
you're sucking a drink out of a straw as
 

993
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,270
you're sucking a drink out of a straw as
they squeeze

994
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
they squeeze
 

995
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,470
they squeeze
you don't

996
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
you don't
 

997
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,149
you don't
change this to a limp

998
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
change this to a limp
 

999
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,190
change this to a limp
so that they're holding nothing

1000
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
so that they're holding nothing
 

1001
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,470
so that they're holding nothing
because

1002
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
because
 

1003
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,950
because
they will get to a point they'll squeeze

1004
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
they will get to a point they'll squeeze
 

1005
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,789
they will get to a point they'll squeeze
now i know they're holding nothing but

1006
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
now i know they're holding nothing but
 

1007
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,350
now i know they're holding nothing but
they've still got their mind firmly on

1008
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
they've still got their mind firmly on
 

1009
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,070
they've still got their mind firmly on
that hold

1010
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
that hold
 

1011
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,630
that hold
so what i now do whether it's the

1012
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
so what i now do whether it's the
 

1013
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,350
so what i now do whether it's the
gripping of the rest

1014
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
gripping of the rest
 

1015
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,549
gripping of the rest
or anything

1016
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559

 

1017
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,669

i

1018
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
i
 

1019
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,630
i
become the mouse or the cat

1020
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
become the mouse or the cat
 

1021
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,830
become the mouse or the cat
and i truly believe that i can

1022
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
and i truly believe that i can
 

1023
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,070
and i truly believe that i can
reduce

1024
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
reduce
 

1025
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,950
reduce
my internal frame

1026
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
my internal frame
 

1027
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,669
my internal frame
so that i can escape

1028
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
so that i can escape
 

1029
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,950
so that i can escape
from

1030
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
from
 

1031
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,590
from
their external frame

1032
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
their external frame
 

1033
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,390
their external frame
so they become the door

1034
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
so they become the door
 

1035
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,230
so they become the door
i become the mouse

1036
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
i become the mouse
 

1037
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,549
i become the mouse
and that bit might be the bit that's

1038
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
and that bit might be the bit that's
 

1039
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,510
and that bit might be the bit that's
blown your way or you just can't

1040
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
blown your way or you just can't
 

1041
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,430
blown your way or you just can't
understand

1042
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
understand
 

1043
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,230
understand
this concept

1044
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240

 

1045
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,470

any more questions or if you've
 

1053
