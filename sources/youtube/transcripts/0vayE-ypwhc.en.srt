00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,980
hi guys in today's video we're going to
be covering football playing hand

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,289
be covering football playing hand
transfers it'll help if you understand

6
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:06,299
transfers it'll help if you understand
 

7
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,849
transfers it'll help if you understand
pendulum swings if you haven't already

8
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:07,859
pendulum swings if you haven't already
 

9
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,879
pendulum swings if you haven't already
seen my video on that I'll post a link

10
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:10,889
seen my video on that I'll post a link
 

11
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,640
seen my video on that I'll post a link
in the description below also watch the

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,320
in the description below also watch the
end this is a variation that I thought

14
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,330
end this is a variation that I thought
 

15
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,269
end this is a variation that I thought
that you might like to try okay so I'll

16
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
that you might like to try okay so I'll
 

17
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,830
that you might like to try okay so I'll
start this movement off with a pendulum

18
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:24,840
start this movement off with a pendulum
 

19
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,170
start this movement off with a pendulum
swing my hand stops at the base of the

20
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
swing my hand stops at the base of the
 

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,970
swing my hand stops at the base of the
pendulum and the momentum of the club

22
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:28,980
pendulum and the momentum of the club
 

23
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,370
pendulum and the momentum of the club
causes a rotation around my wrist the

24
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,380
causes a rotation around my wrist the
 

25
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,569
causes a rotation around my wrist the
transition through a point where the

26
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:32,579
transition through a point where the
 

27
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,490
transition through a point where the
club faces upwards where the laments

28
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,500
club faces upwards where the laments
 

29
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,600
club faces upwards where the laments
have continuing that they're called

30
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:35,610
have continuing that they're called
 

31
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,340
have continuing that they're called
carry on repeat this a few times and try

32
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,350
carry on repeat this a few times and try
 

33
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,260
carry on repeat this a few times and try
and let the club and carry on to do a

34
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,270
and let the club and carry on to do a
 

35
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,639
and let the club and carry on to do a
full pendulum swing the momentum of the

36
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:46,649
full pendulum swing the momentum of the
 

37
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,819
full pendulum swing the momentum of the
club should help you do this also try be

38
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:49,829
club should help you do this also try be
 

39
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,260
club should help you do this also try be
conscious of the three key points that

40
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,270
conscious of the three key points that
 

41
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,670
conscious of the three key points that
you're hitting which is left and right

42
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
you're hitting which is left and right
 

43
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,310
you're hitting which is left and right
and at the bottom of the swing so after

44
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
and at the bottom of the swing so after
 

45
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,810
and at the bottom of the swing so after
doing that a few times the movement

46
00:00:59,810 --> 00:00:59,820
doing that a few times the movement
 

47
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,209
doing that a few times the movement
should be quite smooth here I'm doing it

48
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:02,219
should be quite smooth here I'm doing it
 

49
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,340
should be quite smooth here I'm doing it
from right to left at this moment in

50
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,350
from right to left at this moment in
 

51
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,359
from right to left at this moment in
time I'm not getting the other hand

52
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
time I'm not getting the other hand
 

53
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,990
time I'm not getting the other hand
involved so after getting comfortable

54
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
involved so after getting comfortable
 

55
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
involved so after getting comfortable
with that we can then look at changing

56
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:10,770
with that we can then look at changing
 

57
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,350
with that we can then look at changing
hands okay so this is now with my left

58
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
hands okay so this is now with my left
 

59
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,060
hands okay so this is now with my left
hand doing the movement going left to

60
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,070
hand doing the movement going left to
 

61
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,420
hand doing the movement going left to
right this is basically a mirror of what

62
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,430
right this is basically a mirror of what
 

63
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,460
right this is basically a mirror of what
was previously done from right to left

64
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,470
was previously done from right to left
 

65
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,670
was previously done from right to left
so once you're happy with that we're

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
so once you're happy with that we're
 

67
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,970
so once you're happy with that we're
going to look at transferring the club

68
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:31,980

 

69
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,380

so as I mentioned earlier the club will

70
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,390
so as I mentioned earlier the club will
 

71
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,520
so as I mentioned earlier the club will
transition through a point where it

72
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:35,530
transition through a point where it
 

73
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,470
transition through a point where it
faces upwards is that this point you

74
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:37,480
faces upwards is that this point you
 

75
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,370
faces upwards is that this point you
want to transfer to the other hand

76
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,380
want to transfer to the other hand
 

77
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,930
want to transfer to the other hand
repeat this process a few times where

78
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:42,940
repeat this process a few times where
 

79
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,490
repeat this process a few times where
you continue checking the alignment of

80
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:44,500
you continue checking the alignment of
 

81
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,570
you continue checking the alignment of
the club and also relax and try and feel

82
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:48,580
the club and also relax and try and feel
 

83
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,790
the club and also relax and try and feel
the momentum of the club as that should

84
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:50,800
the momentum of the club as that should
 

85
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,210
the momentum of the club as that should
be what's doing all the work as you can

86
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,220
be what's doing all the work as you can
 

87
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,010
be what's doing all the work as you can
see there's very little bend in my elbow

88
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,020
see there's very little bend in my elbow
 

89
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,840
see there's very little bend in my elbow
my arms are pretty much extended most of

90
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:57,850
my arms are pretty much extended most of
 

91
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,550
my arms are pretty much extended most of
the time

92
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
the time
 

93
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,320
the time
also I try roll my shoulders back and

94
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,330
also I try roll my shoulders back and
 

95
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,749
also I try roll my shoulders back and
open my chest out particularly on the

96
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
open my chest out particularly on the
 

97
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,420
open my chest out particularly on the
upswing otherwise this could cause

98
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,430
upswing otherwise this could cause
 

99
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,770
upswing otherwise this could cause
several shorter problems so this is a

100
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:10,780
several shorter problems so this is a
 

101
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,510
several shorter problems so this is a
full movement alternating between left

102
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:12,520
full movement alternating between left
 

103
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,729
full movement alternating between left
and right we'll have a look at it a bit

104
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:14,739
and right we'll have a look at it a bit
 

105
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:22,620
and right we'll have a look at it a bit
more in detail now close up as you can

106
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:22,630
more in detail now close up as you can
 

107
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,570
more in detail now close up as you can
see here the receiving hand goes

108
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,580
see here the receiving hand goes
 

109
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,820
see here the receiving hand goes
slightly higher than the hand holding

110
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:26,830
slightly higher than the hand holding
 

111
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,330
slightly higher than the hand holding
the club if it's done correctly the club

112
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,340
the club if it's done correctly the club
 

113
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,620
the club if it's done correctly the club
should feel quite light as it

114
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:31,630
should feel quite light as it
 

115
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,550
should feel quite light as it
transitions through the movement I've

116
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
transitions through the movement I've
 

117
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
transitions through the movement I've
slowed down the video so you can see a

118
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,090
slowed down the video so you can see a
 

119
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,630
slowed down the video so you can see a
bit more in detail if you watch here you

120
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
bit more in detail if you watch here you
 

121
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,430
bit more in detail if you watch here you
can see the transition point is when the

122
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
can see the transition point is when the
 

123
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:53,480
can see the transition point is when the
club's facing upwards

124
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,490

 

125
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,020

a lot of method you could use to learn

126
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,030
a lot of method you could use to learn
 

127
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,090
a lot of method you could use to learn
this is to create a larger circle in

128
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,100
this is to create a larger circle in
 

129
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,830
this is to create a larger circle in
front of you which gives you more time

130
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
front of you which gives you more time
 

131
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,370
front of you which gives you more time
to transfer from Hunter hunt as you

132
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,380
to transfer from Hunter hunt as you
 

133
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,020
to transfer from Hunter hunt as you
become more comfortable of this movement

134
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,030
become more comfortable of this movement
 

135
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,450
become more comfortable of this movement
you can tighten up the circle so

136
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:08,460
you can tighten up the circle so
 

137
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,160
you can tighten up the circle so
eventually your hand becomes the pivot

138
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
eventually your hand becomes the pivot
 

139
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,130
eventually your hand becomes the pivot
point this will also speed up the

140
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,140
point this will also speed up the
 

141
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,670
point this will also speed up the
transition to the other hand ok so I

142
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
transition to the other hand ok so I
 

143
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,050
transition to the other hand ok so I
already mentioned about the shoulders

144
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,060
already mentioned about the shoulders
 

145
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,910
already mentioned about the shoulders
being rolled back another thing to think

146
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:22,920
being rolled back another thing to think
 

147
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,740
being rolled back another thing to think
about is your plains and making sure

148
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:24,750
about is your plains and making sure
 

149
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,350
about is your plains and making sure
that they're straight you can see here

150
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
that they're straight you can see here
 

151
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,060
that they're straight you can see here
I'm leaning slightly forward and looking

152
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm leaning slightly forward and looking
 

153
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm leaning slightly forward and looking
down this can easily throw off your

154
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,050
down this can easily throw off your
 

155
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,210
down this can easily throw off your
plains so this can be rectified by

156
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,220
plains so this can be rectified by
 

157
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,120
plains so this can be rectified by
standing up straight and also spotting

158
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,130
standing up straight and also spotting
 

159
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,680
standing up straight and also spotting
the club on the left and right points as

160
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:42,690
the club on the left and right points as
 

161
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,240
the club on the left and right points as
I mentioned before you want to make that

162
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,250
I mentioned before you want to make that
 

163
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,030
I mentioned before you want to make that
plane as straight as possible this will

164
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
plane as straight as possible this will
 

165
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,970
plane as straight as possible this will
enable a smoother transition ok so just

166
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:52,980
enable a smoother transition ok so just
 

167
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,830
enable a smoother transition ok so just
to recap we've done an outwards version

168
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,840
to recap we've done an outwards version
 

169
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,140
to recap we've done an outwards version
of that movement there is also the

170
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
of that movement there is also the
 

171
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,140
of that movement there is also the
opportunity to do an in words variation

172
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,150
opportunity to do an in words variation
 

173
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,570
opportunity to do an in words variation
so as you can see here the pendulum

174
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
so as you can see here the pendulum
 

175
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,210
so as you can see here the pendulum
starts from across my body essentially

176
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,220
starts from across my body essentially
 

177
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,070
starts from across my body essentially
you just do the same thing but just in

178
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
you just do the same thing but just in
 

179
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,250
you just do the same thing but just in
Reverse to switch between variations you

180
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,260
Reverse to switch between variations you
 

181
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,930
Reverse to switch between variations you
can let the club swing without changing

182
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:11,940
can let the club swing without changing
 

183
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,470
can let the club swing without changing
hands and here you can see we're back to

184
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,480
hands and here you can see we're back to
 

185
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,539
hands and here you can see we're back to
the outwards variation which is

186
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:17,549
the outwards variation which is
 

187
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,070
the outwards variation which is
identified with the club that extended

188
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,080
identified with the club that extended
 

189
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,650
identified with the club that extended
outwards personally I don't use the

190
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:21,660
outwards personally I don't use the
 

191
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,200
outwards personally I don't use the
inward variation that much myself but

192
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,210
inward variation that much myself but
 

193
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,790
inward variation that much myself but
anyway never play with it let me know

194
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
anyway never play with it let me know
 

195
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,880
anyway never play with it let me know
what you think and as always thanks

196
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:28,890
what you think and as always thanks
 

197
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,910
what you think and as always thanks
again for watching

198
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:30,920
again for watching
 

199
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:45,839
again for watching
