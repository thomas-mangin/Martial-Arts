1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,550

I'll give you a bit more detail

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560

 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,369

you have to explode expression with the

4
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:07,379
you have to explode expression with the
 

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,770
you have to explode expression with the
hand so my hand is at right angles

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:09,780
hand so my hand is at right angles
 

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,790
hand so my hand is at right angles
really

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
really
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,249
really
right if it's not a right angles and

10
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:13,259
right if it's not a right angles and
 

11
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,289
right if it's not a right angles and
it's sort of like halfway there I've

12
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:15,299
it's sort of like halfway there I've
 

13
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,410
it's sort of like halfway there I've
started closing up this Gap here

14
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
started closing up this Gap here
 

15
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,210
started closing up this Gap here
so

16
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,220
so
 

17
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,150
so
what happens is his wrist doesn't turn

18
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
what happens is his wrist doesn't turn
 

19
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,269
what happens is his wrist doesn't turn
all the way over it stays uh if I had a

20
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:26,279
all the way over it stays uh if I had a
 

21
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,630
all the way over it stays uh if I had a
Joe it would be like at that angle

22
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:29,640
Joe it would be like at that angle
 

23
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,790
Joe it would be like at that angle
I need it

24
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
I need it
 

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,450
I need it
parallel is it parallel flat I need it

26
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,460
parallel is it parallel flat I need it
 

27
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,830
parallel is it parallel flat I need it
this way so the thumb can go in there

28
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,840
this way so the thumb can go in there
 

29
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,690
this way so the thumb can go in there
now now it might seem a small thing but

30
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:41,700
now now it might seem a small thing but
 

31
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,330
now now it might seem a small thing but
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb

32
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb
 

33
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,910
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb
gets a grip

34
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:46,920
gets a grip
 

35
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,729
gets a grip
but it never gets at the flat the flat

36
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:49,739
but it never gets at the flat the flat
 

37
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,310
but it never gets at the flat the flat
can't of the thumb can't get on it

38
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,320

 

39
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,729

I get a bit there but the thumb now has

40
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:58,739
I get a bit there but the thumb now has
 

41
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,910
I get a bit there but the thumb now has
to bend to get there if I turn it I just

42
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
to bend to get there if I turn it I just
 

43
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,770
to bend to get there if I turn it I just
put the thumb in and it fits can you all

44
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:03,780
put the thumb in and it fits can you all
 

45
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,390
put the thumb in and it fits can you all
see that

46
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
see that
 

47
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,969
see that
okay

48
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:06,979
okay
 

49
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,990
okay
that's what makes it strong

50
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000

 

51
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,130

so you've got to crank it round

52
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,140
so you've got to crank it round
 

53
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,410
so you've got to crank it round
you've got to crank that round until

54
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
you've got to crank that round until
 

55
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,670
you've got to crank that round until
that thumb

56
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
that thumb
 

57
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,370
that thumb
has got that family

58
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
has got that family
 

59
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,050
has got that family
because what we're going to do is we're

60
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,060
because what we're going to do is we're
 

61
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,690
because what we're going to do is we're
not going to just do she and Aggie and

62
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
not going to just do she and Aggie and
 

63
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,070
not going to just do she and Aggie and
this thumb is going to be really

64
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
this thumb is going to be really
 

65
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,929
this thumb is going to be really
important to where where it's placed

66
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939

 

67
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,649

when we get doing higher forms like Yoko

68
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:36,659
when we get doing higher forms like Yoko
 

69
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,569
when we get doing higher forms like Yoko
mnuchi and that you're going to be

70
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
mnuchi and that you're going to be
 

71
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,609
mnuchi and that you're going to be
finding it's really difficult to get

72
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619
finding it's really difficult to get
 

73
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,850
finding it's really difficult to get
that Thumb in in time

74
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:43,860
that Thumb in in time
 

75
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,550
that Thumb in in time
because your other hand gets busy to to

76
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
because your other hand gets busy to to
 

77
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,310

81
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,530
with a small one but this isn't turned
enough look so I've got to crank it

82
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540

 

83
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,870

as hard as I can crank it I need to
