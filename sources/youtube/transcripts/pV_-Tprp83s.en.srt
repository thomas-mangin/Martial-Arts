1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,269

so they're doing whatever right so I

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
so they're doing whatever right so I
 

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,749
so they're doing whatever right so I
can't be like this I don't know what's

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
can't be like this I don't know what's
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,709
can't be like this I don't know what's
happening that he already move when he

6
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:09,719
happening that he already move when he
 

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,549
happening that he already move when he
brought his foot back right I'm already

8
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
brought his foot back right I'm already
 

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,629
brought his foot back right I'm already
moving this way so let's do again

10
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
moving this way so let's do again
 

11
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,029
moving this way so let's do again
there's a lot of pre-movement a lot of

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
there's a lot of pre-movement a lot of
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,230
there's a lot of pre-movement a lot of
pre movement and there's also a lot of

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
pre movement and there's also a lot of
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,150
pre movement and there's also a lot of
pay attention to the opening yes okay so

16
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
pay attention to the opening yes okay so
 

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,710
pay attention to the opening yes okay so
I'm not going like this

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720

 

19
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,269

right a lot of preo right

20
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279

 

21
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:41,389

lot of pre

22
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399

 

23
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,709

movement pre movement all right every

24
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
movement pre movement all right every
 

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,430
movement pre movement all right every
time

26
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440

 

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,910

pre

28
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920

 

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,189

movement move

30
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199

 

31
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:17,510

it move

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520

 

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,789

it

34
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

 

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:52,030

move moov

36
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,040

 

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,950

moving now I like this

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:01:59,960

 

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,830

so

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
so
 

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,630
so
boom

42
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
boom
 

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,790
boom
boom

44
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:09,800

 

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,470

boom look for the openings and add your

46
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
boom look for the openings and add your
 

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:28,830
boom look for the openings and add your
pre

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840

 

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:58,830

movement

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840

 

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:28,750

e

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,760

 

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:58,710

e

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720

 

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:28,710

e

56
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720

 

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:05:07,189

e e

58
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199

 

59
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,590

so if I do keyan right and you go like

60
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,600
so if I do keyan right and you go like
 

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,950
so if I do keyan right and you go like
this and I don't know what you think

62
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
this and I don't know what you think
 

63
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,710
this and I don't know what you think
that is but there should be a a

64
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,720
that is but there should be a a
 

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,430
that is but there should be a a
disturbance of this

66
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
disturbance of this
 

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,629
disturbance of this
balance right at contact okay so now

68
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
balance right at contact okay so now
 

69
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,390
balance right at contact okay so now
we're

70
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,400
we're
 

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,189
we're
ballistic go it doesn't matter that's

72
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:24,199
ballistic go it doesn't matter that's
 

73
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,790
ballistic go it doesn't matter that's
not

74
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
not
 

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,990
not
it notice this this isn't it right

76
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,000
it notice this this isn't it right
 

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,390
it notice this this isn't it right
that that's only that if he takes one

78
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,400
that that's only that if he takes one
 

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,270
that that's only that if he takes one
step right then I can pull him off down

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
step right then I can pull him off down
 

81
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,469
step right then I can pull him off down
but in this situation he's Dynamic so

82
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:39,479
but in this situation he's Dynamic so
 

83
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,510
but in this situation he's Dynamic so
he's just walking through you see and I

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
he's just walking through you see and I
 

85
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,350
he's just walking through you see and I
just have a guy standing

86
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
just have a guy standing
 

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,070
just have a guy standing
up so I'm not deviating for the sake of

88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
up so I'm not deviating for the sake of
 

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,870
up so I'm not deviating for the sake of
deviation I'm not that's not why make a

90
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
deviation I'm not that's not why make a
 

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,469
deviation I'm not that's not why make a
principle out of it just say get out of

92
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
principle out of it just say get out of
 

93
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,309
principle out of it just say get out of
the

94
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:53,319
the
 

95
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,390
the
way then secondly same thing I'm not

96
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:57,400
way then secondly same thing I'm not
 

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,230
way then secondly same thing I'm not
blocking just for deflection

98
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,240
blocking just for deflection
 

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,430
blocking just for deflection
again there's no need for a principle if

100
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
again there's no need for a principle if
 

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,469
again there's no need for a principle if
you're just going to say stop it from

102
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:05,479
you're just going to say stop it from
 

103
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,870
you're just going to say stop it from
hitting you okay so my movement has to

104
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:09,880
hitting you okay so my movement has to
 

105
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,670
hitting you okay so my movement has to
do things to

106
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
do things to
 

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,550
do things to
him and that is achieved through the yin

108
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
him and that is achieved through the yin
 

109
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,110
him and that is achieved through the yin
space the yin space so I let him

110
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120

 

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,870

in that that same movement is what's

112
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:25,880
in that that same movement is what's
 

113
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,150
in that that same movement is what's
allowing me to hit him that you saw in

114
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
allowing me to hit him that you saw in
 

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,350
allowing me to hit him that you saw in
the last break right right so as

116
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
the last break right right so as
 

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,230
the last break right right so as
supposed to go like

118
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
supposed to go like
 

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,550
supposed to go like
this like that no the movement is here

120
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,560
this like that no the movement is here
 

121
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,510
this like that no the movement is here
boom and you

122
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
boom and you
 

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,749
boom and you
hit even when I don't hit right so again

124
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
hit even when I don't hit right so again
 

125
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,909
hit even when I don't hit right so again
right boom keep him going forward you

126
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:48,919
right boom keep him going forward you
 

127
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,790
right boom keep him going forward you
see and he hits the

128
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
see and he hits the
 

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,270
see and he hits the
forearm if I need help boom

130
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280

 

131
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,230

hit but not this

132
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240

 

133
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,150

be

134
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,160
be
 

135
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,990
be
closer boom whatever doesn't work that's

136
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
closer boom whatever doesn't work that's
 

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,749
closer boom whatever doesn't work that's
your TMI because you'll have a Yin space

138
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759
your TMI because you'll have a Yin space
 

139
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,189
your TMI because you'll have a Yin space
so he has a lot of balance okay cool

140
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
so he has a lot of balance okay cool
 

141
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,909
so he has a lot of balance okay cool
boom that's your Yin

142
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
boom that's your Yin
 

143
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,790
boom that's your Yin
space but the art

144
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
space but the art
 

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,309
space but the art
move move and let through move and let

146
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319

 

147
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,309

through you can mix it up

148
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:27,319

 

149
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:34,589

right move

150
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:34,599

 

151
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,070

don't stop

152
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
don't stop
 

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,990
don't stop
him you're stabilizing

154
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
him you're stabilizing
 

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,230
him you're stabilizing
him keep him

156
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
him keep him
 

157
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,710
him keep him
going he's right here look look so you

158
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
going he's right here look look so you
 

159
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,830
going he's right here look look so you
can see the

160
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
can see the
 

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,110
can see the
force back again to same strike yog in

162
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
force back again to same strike yog in
 

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,909
force back again to same strike yog in
so you see right here he keeps going on

164
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
so you see right here he keeps going on
 

165
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,469
so you see right here he keeps going on
the circle and he's starting this

166
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
the circle and he's starting this
 

167
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,510
the circle and he's starting this
balance going that's the deviation Boom

168
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:58,520
balance going that's the deviation Boom
 

169
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,309
balance going that's the deviation Boom
for the strike

170
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:01,319
for the strike
 

171
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,589
for the strike
it's all right there

172
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
it's all right there
 

173
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:28,430
it's all right there
boom okay put it all together

174
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440

 

175
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:58,430

go

176
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440

 

177
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:50,949

e e

178
