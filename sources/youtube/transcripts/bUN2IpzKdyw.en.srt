1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,669

so you have a

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
so you have a
 

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,669
so you have a
viki tyso

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
viki tyso
 

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,910
viki tyso
so it is a drill

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
so it is a drill
 

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,990
so it is a drill
a micro drill of another micro drill

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
a micro drill of another micro drill
 

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,429
a micro drill of another micro drill

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
but inside the micro drill bike tyson
 

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,589
but inside the micro drill bike tyson
there's tiny tiny parts you can just

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
there's tiny tiny parts you can just
 

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,870
there's tiny tiny parts you can just
micro drilled

16
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
micro drilled
 

17
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,509
micro drilled
those parts okay

18
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
those parts okay
 

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,229
those parts okay
you have to have these parts

20
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
you have to have these parts
 

21
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,590
you have to have these parts
because they're the master key moves

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
because they're the master key moves
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,350
because they're the master key moves
they're the parts that open all the

24
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
they're the parts that open all the
 

25
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,590
they're the parts that open all the
other stuff that make it a micro drill

26
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
other stuff that make it a micro drill
 

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,389
other stuff that make it a micro drill
okay that you can take this these tiny

28
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
okay that you can take this these tiny
 

29
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,110
okay that you can take this these tiny
parts and use them in an abundance of

30
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
parts and use them in an abundance of
 

31
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,830
parts and use them in an abundance of
places okay

32
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
places okay
 

33
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,190
places okay
so

34
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
so
 

35
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,670
so
in tai nohenko

36
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
in tai nohenko
 

37
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,950
in tai nohenko
uh

38
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
uh
 

39
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,389
uh
it's not it's not any of this

it's not it's not any of this
 

41
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,110
it's not it's not any of this
you do inward spirals like everywhere so

42
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
you do inward spirals like everywhere so
 

43
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,709
you do inward spirals like everywhere so
why do

44
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
why do
 

45
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,709
why do
you encounter okay

46
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
you encounter okay
 

47
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,230
you encounter okay
uh you do rotation you you do a

48
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
uh you do rotation you you do a
 

49
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,630
uh you do rotation you you do a
spiraling geometry everywhere why do you

50
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
spiraling geometry everywhere why do you
 

51
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,830
spiraling geometry everywhere why do you
tie your ankle okay

52
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
tie your ankle okay
 

53
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,550
tie your ankle okay
um you reconcile ribs and energy

54
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
um you reconcile ribs and energy
 

55
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,350
um you reconcile ribs and energy
everywhere so why do there's no point

56
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
everywhere so why do there's no point
 

57
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,390
everywhere so why do there's no point
okay

58
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
okay
 

59
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,350
okay
the point that you have

60
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
the point that you have
 

61
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,429
the point that you have
is that you're going to we'll do it this

62
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
is that you're going to we'll do it this
 

63
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,109
is that you're going to we'll do it this
way

64
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
way
 

65
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,870
way
you're going to have multiple

66
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
you're going to have multiple
 

67
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,710
you're going to have multiple
repetitions

68
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
repetitions
 

69
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,550
repetitions
on

70
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,560
on
 

71
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,230
on
establishing a

72
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
establishing a
 

73
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,990
establishing a
single pivot point

74
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
single pivot point
 

75
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,230
single pivot point
that foot i'm lifting this foot so you

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
that foot i'm lifting this foot so you
 

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,350
that foot i'm lifting this foot so you
can see

78
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
can see
 

79
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,510
can see
the difference so you're going to do

80
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
the difference so you're going to do
 

81
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,030
the difference so you're going to do
you're leaving you're going to

82
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
you're leaving you're going to
 

83
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,760
you're leaving you're going to
transition

84
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:43,770
transition
 

85
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,350
transition
[Music]

86
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
[Music]
 

87
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,109
[Music]
and rotate

88
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
and rotate
 

89
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,389
and rotate
home

90
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
home
 

91
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,429
home
on that single pivot point

92
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439

 

93
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,910

so if you're going to rotate

94
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
so if you're going to rotate
 

95
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,630
so if you're going to rotate
on double points do you see

96
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
on double points do you see
 

97
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,190
on double points do you see
there's no point that's not it you can't

98
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
there's no point that's not it you can't
 

99
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,590
there's no point that's not it you can't
use that anywhere okay

100
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
use that anywhere okay
 

101
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,590
use that anywhere okay
single pivot point you're going to use

102
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
single pivot point you're going to use
 

103
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,670
single pivot point you're going to use
everywhere okay

104
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
everywhere okay
 

105
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,710
everywhere okay
so

106
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
so
 

107
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,150
so
in

108
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
in
 

109
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,390
in
every single pivot point

110
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400

 

111
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,830

you need me

112
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
you need me
 

113
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,830
you need me
single pivot point

114
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
single pivot point

117
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,750

so you could buy you a drill a single

118
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
so you could buy you a drill a single
 

119
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,949
so you could buy you a drill a single
figure point

120

what do you think my

146
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
what do you think my
 

147
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,470
what do you think my
center is doing

148
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
center is doing
 

149
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,390
center is doing
it's going down okay

150
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
it's going down okay
 

151
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,790
it's going down okay
so the micro drill

152
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
so the micro drill
 

153
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,390
so the micro drill
aspect you want

154
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
aspect you want
 

155
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,270
aspect you want
is

156
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
is
 

157
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,350
is
how to put your center

158
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
how to put your center
 

159
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,470
how to put your center
underneath his center

160
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
underneath his center
 

161
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,710
underneath his center
not how to push your center

162
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
not how to push your center
 

163
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,910
not how to push your center
straight back

164
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
straight back
 

165
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,789
straight back
you see

166
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
you see
 

167
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,589
you see
so

168
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
so
 

169
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,470
so
uh

170
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
uh
 

171
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,789
uh
any drill

172
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799

 

173
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,910

so

174
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
so
 

175
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,670
so
i don't just go in

176
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
i don't just go in
 

177
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,670
i don't just go in
and go here

178
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680

 

179
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,390

center goes on not just down

180
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
center goes on not just down
 

181
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,110
center goes on not just down
under your center okay if you're really

182
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
under your center okay if you're really
 

183
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
under your center okay if you're really
if you're much shorter than me i'm gonna

184
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
if you're much shorter than me i'm gonna
 

185
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,270
if you're much shorter than me i'm gonna
get really low so

186
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
get really low so
 

187
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,070
get really low so
under your center

188
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080

 

189
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,309

here

190
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
here
 

191
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,990
here
you see that difference

192
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
you see that difference
 

193
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,869
you see that difference
so

194
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
so
 

195
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,390
so
under his center

196
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400

 

197
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,070

and so same thing

198
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
and so same thing
 

199
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,190
and so same thing
you could micro drill under a center

200
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
you could micro drill under a center
 

201
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,310
you could micro drill under a center
under center

202
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320

 

203
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,110

you could do that you probably should

204
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
you could do that you probably should
 

205
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,790
you could do that you probably should
okay

206
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
okay
 

207
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,230
okay
so make sure you have these two things

208
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
so make sure you have these two things
 

209
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,870
so make sure you have these two things
in your iv tie tyson for tai no henko

210
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
in your iv tie tyson for tai no henko
 

211
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,350
in your iv tie tyson for tai no henko
and he didn't

212
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360

 

213
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,950

um

214
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
um
 

215
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,390
um
so i want to get under your center

216
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
so i want to get under your center
 

217
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,749
so i want to get under your center
that's true that's true

218
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
that's true that's true
 

219
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,189
that's true that's true
but what i do with that positioning is

220
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
but what i do with that positioning is
 

221
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,590
but what i do with that positioning is
not a free-for-all

222
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
not a free-for-all
 

223
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,749
not a free-for-all
so i still have to do the internal

224
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
so i still have to do the internal
 

225
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,790
so i still have to do the internal
aspect so your energy still has to go

226
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
aspect so your energy still has to go
 

227
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,990
aspect so your energy still has to go
through me and then in this case i have

228
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
through me and then in this case i have
 

229
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,909
through me and then in this case i have
a cochu projection

230
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
a cochu projection
 

231
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,469
a cochu projection
so it has to go through me twice it has

232
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
so it has to go through me twice it has
 

233
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,710
so it has to go through me twice it has
to hit the ground it has to come back

234
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
to hit the ground it has to come back
 

235
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,230
to hit the ground it has to come back
out okay

236
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
out okay
 

237
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,950
out okay
uh so i'm not gonna go over here and

238
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
uh so i'm not gonna go over here and
 

239
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,590
uh so i'm not gonna go over here and
that's that's not it okay

240
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
that's that's not it okay
 

241
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,950
that's that's not it okay
so it's going through me boom

242
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960

 

243
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,790

of course i don't want to just push her

244
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
of course i don't want to just push her
 

245
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,590
of course i don't want to just push her
over here on this plane i'm getting

246
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
over here on this plane i'm getting
 

247
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,909
over here on this plane i'm getting
under her you see

248
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
under her you see
 

249
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,909
under her you see
under her

250
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
under her
 

251
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:40,250
under her
but this energy

252
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,260

 

253
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,150

[Music]

254
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
[Music]
 

255
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,230
[Music]
even if i want the other arm positioning

256
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
even if i want the other arm positioning
 

257
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,550
even if i want the other arm positioning
i have to be under her

258
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
i have to be under her
 

259
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,430
i have to be under her
not

260
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
not
 

261
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,629
not
even definitely not higher but it's

262
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
even definitely not higher but it's
 

263
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,629
even definitely not higher but it's
still

264
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639

 

265
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,710

internal okay

266
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
internal okay
 

267
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,909
internal okay
now

268
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919

 

269
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,390

some idiot comment

270
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
some idiot comment
 

271
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,309
some idiot comment
oh i don't like to see techniques done

272
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
oh i don't like to see techniques done
 

273
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,830
oh i don't like to see techniques done
on women

274
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
on women
 

275
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,990
on women
i guess you got no right to be trained

276
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
i guess you got no right to be trained
 

277
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,950
i guess you got no right to be trained
and feel your teacher's technique

278
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
and feel your teacher's technique
 

279
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,990
and feel your teacher's technique
um

280
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
um
 

281
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,629
um
but it brings up the point

282
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
but it brings up the point
 

283
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,590
but it brings up the point
that

284
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
that
 

285
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,430
that
i i'm not pushing on you okay

286
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
i i'm not pushing on you okay
 

287
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,189
i i'm not pushing on you okay
so

288
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
so
 

289
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,590
so
uh she goes

290
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600

 

291
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,629

um

292
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
um
 

293
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,150
um
of course

294
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160

 

295
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,550

it doesn't it doesn't matter

296
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
it doesn't it doesn't matter
 

297
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,629
it doesn't it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter it does not mind

298
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639

 

299
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,309

if you're doing it internally

300
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
if you're doing it internally
 

301
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,749
if you're doing it internally
do you get it

302
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
do you get it
 

303
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,790
do you get it
which is why

304
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800

 

305
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,270

energetically

306
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280

 

307
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,830

it's not

308
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840

 

309
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,550

okay
people are idiots

314
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
people are idiots
 

315
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,469
people are idiots
okay

316
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
okay
 

317
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,469
okay
so don't be one

don't try to outpower someone
 

321
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,390
don't try to outpower someone
try to do the arts internal aspects okay

322
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
try to do the arts internal aspects okay
 

323
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,189
try to do the arts internal aspects okay
so yes under okay but what do i do once

324
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
so yes under okay but what do i do once
 

325
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,270
so yes under okay but what do i do once
i'm under i'm not just trying to lift

326
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
i'm under i'm not just trying to lift
 

327
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,670
i'm under i'm not just trying to lift
this thing from the bottom that's not it

328
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
this thing from the bottom that's not it
 

329
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,400
this thing from the bottom that's not it
that's wrong okay
