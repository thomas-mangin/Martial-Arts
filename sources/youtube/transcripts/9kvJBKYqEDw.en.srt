1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,610
We have stuff like aloe, eggplants, the tomato will be ready soon.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,350
Lots of celery, there is a lot of stuff, right?

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,566
[Guillaume] Sensei, do you cook?

4
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:18,094
I don't cook, I eat [laughs]

5
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:21,895
All the herbs will bloom like this.

6
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,899
I'm glad that we're meeting today!

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,001
[Guillaume] It's a gorgeous day, right?

8
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,334
Yes.

9
00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:17,846
[Guillaume] Sensei, when were you born?

10
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:22,983
I was born on January 1st, 1940.

11
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:34,169
Even though I was born in Tokyo, we moved to the countryside during War.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:47,589
I could play in the mountain, and in rivers since I was small until I was about 7 years old, so I love nature.

13
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:50,820
When it got better, we moved.

14
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,029
My parents didn't practice budo. 

15
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:02,730
My sibling didn't practice it either.

16
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:13,140
It started for me because I liked to do many things by myself like swordplay or swimming.

17
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:19,467
I liked to walk in the mountain and swim in the river. 

18
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:25,336
You went back to Tōkyō at age 7, how was life there after the war?

19
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:30,979
Yes, I went back to Tokyo since I was 7 years old, yes.

20
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,881
Japan had lost the war,

21
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:43,400
it was a period of reconstruction so there was no food,

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,911
it was very difficult.

23
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:59,075
However, I feel that it turned out to be a good thing because I was able to experience a simple life, so I'm grateful.

24
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,519
We became one with nature

25
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,819
so I think that these were happy times.

26
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,739
[Guillaume] Were you able to attend school for long?

27
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,439
I didn't.

28
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:20,058
I couldn't go to up to university.

29
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:31,160
Everyone was poor, so most children weren't be able to afford higher education.

30
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,403
I stopped at junior high.

31
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:48,239
My mother and father didn't have money so I could not stay idle.

32
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,124
I did a lot of part time jobs such as delivering milk...

33
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:57,459
Do you know about fermented soy beans?

34
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,117
[Guillaume] Yes, I do.

35
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:04,888
I went to pick it up and to sell it, it was fun.

36
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:14,929
Natto is at the top of the food pyramid because it's the healthiest, so on the contrary, I was very happy.

37
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,750
[Guillaume] Do you still eat it?

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,563
Yes still I eat it now.

39
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:26,317
Brown rice too, I'm fortunate because I learned to appreciate simple foods.

40
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:32,820
[Guillaume] Did you first start practicing budō at school?

41
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:42,440
Yes, I started with Judo during junior high school,

42
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,345
around 14 or 16 years old.

43
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:55,199
I just did a little bit at school, but I didn't like the aspects of winning or losing.

44
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
After that I did Kendo, I found it really interesting.

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,206
Kendo was fun. 

46
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:09,584
The teacher gave me a very strange feeling.

47
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:13,433
The shinai is made of soft bamboo, right?

48
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:19,350
Even though he hit me lightly, the tip of the shinai reached all the way to my back.

49
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,837
He was a high ranked teacher.

50
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:24,447
When I saw that I thought that it was really interesting.

51
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,318
Even with minimal strength, it went all the way around.

52
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:29,918
My back hurt! [laughs]

53
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:31,721
It was fun.

54
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:36,459
From that point I read a lot of old books and I saw that

55
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:49,763
the old warriors would throw 60kg rice bags using the tip of their spear, like this.

56
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:59,844
It seems that such a thing really happened, and I thought it was interesting to see that, and that's how I became interested in martial arts.

57
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:06,000
[Guillaume] From there, you got into aikidō?

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:20,780
Yes. During that time, I was doing lots of sports, athletics, swimming, and I was having fun,

59
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:36,115
but was wondering if I could learn something more like budo like what I've described like the stuff with the spear or the shinai.

60
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:45,781
At that time I read an advertisement about Aikido that had come out in a newspaper.

61
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:50,419
It was rather mysterious stuff.

62
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:56,164
So I went there straight away.

63
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:59,025
[Guillaume] Were there any photos in that ad?

64
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:02,519
No there weren't any, just writing.

65
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,360
[Guillaume] So that made it mysterious...

66
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,002
Yes, that's it, mysterious!

67
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:17,213
How was the atmosphere during practice back then?

68
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:22,705
It was very interesting even though I didn't know anything about it! 

69
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,940
Aikido wasn't very popular yet, 

70
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,894
so there weren't many students, but the teachers were amazing.

71
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:43,374
People like the now-deceased Tamura Sensei who then went to France, many of them were still beginners, shodan max.

72
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:48,922
There were people like the Ki No Kenkyukai's Tohei Koichi Sensei,

73
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:52,399
Yamaguchi Sensei as well, and also people like Tada Sensei.

74
00:07:52,399 --> 00:08:01,945
Tada Sensei said that he decided to do Aikido professionally after he finished university.

75
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:06,223
It was that generation, it was a really happy time.

76
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:09,542
Yes, Arikawa Sensei too was there. [laughs]

77
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:12,000
[Guillaume] You learnt many different styles, right?

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,619
There were a lot of great teachers.

79
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:24,000
They didn't care if you were poor and had no money, they just loved Aikido.

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,653
[Guillaume] Where was the dojo located in Tokyo?

81
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:27,345
The Sankei Dojo?

82
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:27,963
[Guillaume] Yes.

83
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:29,766
It was... do you know Yurakucho?

84
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,001
[Guillaume] Yes I do.

85
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:38,867
It was just underground from where the bullet train starts running.

86
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,870
[Guillaume] I was a popular place, right?

87
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,374
That's right it was in...

88
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:44,128
[Guillaume] There were many office workers?

89
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,211
It was in Ginza.

90
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,000
[Guillaume] A busy place...

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,738
Yes, there were many interesting people there.

92
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:58,609
I heard that famous people like the famous writer Nishima Yukio and the sumōtori turned wrestler Rikidōzan were training there at the time.

93
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:04,411
They weren't in that dojo, I mean that they were in the room next door.

94
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,169
They did it there.

95
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,647
[Guillaume] It wasn't Aikido?

96
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:12,108
No. It was Rikitozan, so he did that sort of [physical] training.

97
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,108
[Guillaume] The sumo...

98
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,089
Nishima Yukio was doing "hey!", "hey!" with a thick wooden sword.

99
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,194
[Guillaume] Ah, you never practiced together...

100
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:27,777
I never did, they were from a completely different world.

101
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,200
[Guillaume] Did you ever speak to them?

102
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,752
Yes, but just things like "hello" or "good morning".

103
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,305
[Guillaume] What sort of impression did you get from those people?

104
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:42,550
Hmm... I don't know really. I thought they were strange people.

105
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,836
Rikutozan was a famous person, a "national hero"

106
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:51,664
I didn't know much about Nishima Yukio yet.

107
00:09:51,664 --> 00:10:05,344
He had some private soldiers from the Self Defense Force around him.

108
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:09,703
He was training to fight with a real enemy using real swords.

109
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:16,556
At same time though, he wrote some wonderful and beautiful books.

110
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:19,990
I thought that he looked interesting.

111
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,580
[Guillaume] We have this image of Mishima as a sensitive writer, but also as a rather enthusiastic right-wing martial artist. I wonder whether those two aspects of his personality as a Japanese were distinct depending on the context he was in.

112
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:37,650
It was the same. Even though he did "hey!" In Japan we think that you have to take care of your heart and your spirit.

113
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:45,896
Japan lost the Second World War but it also defeated the heart of the Japanese people. They said that it shouldn't be.

114
00:10:45,896 --> 00:11:00,760
The Emperor always said that we should all get along with the people of the world but the Japanese forgot that.

115
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,138
It was during the time when the Americans said that Japanese people were no good.

116
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:12,577
But he wrote beautiful novels, really beautiful novels.

117
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:18,000
[Guillaume] I thought that budō had a bad image among the Japanese population for a long time because of its ties to what happened during the war.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,414
In fact, I don't think Japanese people thought about martial arts much because martial arts had already become part of their normal lives, 

119
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:36,721
but due to the fact that the General Headquarters, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers forbade kendo and the rest

120
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:48,420
We forgot the good things about kendo, that it wasn't about killing each other.

121
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,910
That's a bit unfortunate.

122
00:11:50,910 --> 00:12:05,318
It's not a technique to kill each other, it's originally meant to clean the soul.

123
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:10,254
How is it that the meaning of budō got to be so misused or misunderstood?

124
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:13,527
I don't know how it used to be, 

125
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:17,492
but originally, Japanese people didn't really like killing people

126
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:23,503
but it was the war so train their body so that they wouldn't lose, right?

127
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:26,300
That was the reason.

128
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,834
[Guillaume] The Second Dōshu actually considered the positive aspects of budō as a way to restore Japanese self-esteem.

129
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:38,464
It's about self-esteem, not material things.

130
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,684
I really think so.

131
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:50,380
Well, food is important, but we threw away our self-esteem and spirit

132
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,558
and even though I was just a child, it saddened me.

133
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,558
[Guillaume] About Rikidōzan, there seem to have been a connection between him and Tōhei Sensei. I always wonder whether other famous people like him were interested in aikidō.

134
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:17,113
Well, in fact, over there, many people practiced things like Judo or Karate were able to enter and do Aikido and they found it wonderful.

135
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:24,000
People like O Sensei or Tohei Sensei were there

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,067
and even though they grabbed them strongly, they got thrown.

137
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,703
It made them wonder a lot.

138
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:34,450
Besides that, I don't really know.

139
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,296
There was also the baseball's most famous player, Sadaharu Oh.

140
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,296
He was a super hero.

141
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:53,277
He had a specific way to bat, on one leg.

142
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:56,343
He hit with one leg up and really threw far.

143
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:59,804
He learned that from studying Aikido.

144
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:00,793
[Guillaume] Not from kenjutsu?

145
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,793
No, not that.

146
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:06,741
It was interesting, a lot of different people were doing it.
