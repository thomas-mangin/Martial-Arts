00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
okay so remember he's trying to finally

okay so remember he's trying to finally
displace see he's not grabbing in there

4
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
displace see he's not grabbing in there
 

5
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,270
displace see he's not grabbing in there
and just stand them there because you're

6
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and just stand them there because you're
 

7
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,109
and just stand them there because you're
you would go

8
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119

 

9
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,230

forward forward right you go

10
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,240
forward forward right you go
 

11
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,789
forward forward right you go
forward you guys understand so it's not

12
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
forward you guys understand so it's not
 

13
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,109
forward you guys understand so it's not
a grip you you e to get off the grip and

14
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:48,119
a grip you you e to get off the grip and
 

15
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,109
a grip you you e to get off the grip and
and you're attacking back okay he's

16
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
and you're attacking back okay he's
 

17
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,950
and you're attacking back okay he's
pushing forward for followup

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:55,960

 

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,550

attacks so as he's going your t cling

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560

 

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,389

that and watch my shoulder in space

22
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
that and watch my shoulder in space
 

23
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,910
that and watch my shoulder in space
plotted in space it's going you see just

24
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
plotted in space it's going you see just
 

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,710
plotted in space it's going you see just
right out of his

26
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,720

 

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,350

reach

28
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
reach
 

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,470
reach
boom

30
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,480
boom
 

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,710
boom
okay so that he falls into that

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
okay so that he falls into that
 

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,830
okay so that he falls into that
void and his shoulder goes forward of

34
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
void and his shoulder goes forward of
 

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,790
void and his shoulder goes forward of
his

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
his
 

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,750
his
hand now you project his on

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
hand now you project his on
 

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,150
hand now you project his on
then and then the arm is vulnerable so

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,160
then and then the arm is vulnerable so
 

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,190
then and then the arm is vulnerable so
you take the arm pinning the

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,200

 

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,190

shoulder this first part is

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200

 

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,750

timing shoulder

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760

 

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,750

down we have to match his

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760

 

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:11,430

r

50
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440

 

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,190

so my shoulder can't go straight out to

52
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,200
so my shoulder can't go straight out to
 

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,550
so my shoulder can't go straight out to
the

54
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560

not straight out to the side you're
 

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,710
not straight out to the side you're
going to get

yangong energy go back one little step
and he goes

96
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
and he goes
 

97
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,150
and he goes
forward boom that's what I push so he's

98
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
forward boom that's what I push so he's
 

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,309

107
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:58,469

understand around and pop then I'm

108

you have to see past the shapes of
 

129
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,350
you have to see past the shapes of
things okay so uh let's just do the

130
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
things okay so uh let's just do the
 

131
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,389
things okay so uh let's just do the
first one again so he's got that spinal

132
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:31,399
first one again so he's got that spinal
 

133
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,709

Circle do you see okay and so I'm at the

140
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
Circle do you see okay and so I'm at the
 

141
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,350
Circle do you see okay and so I'm at the
edge of his power that's there's nothing

142
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
edge of his power that's there's nothing
 

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,110
edge of his power that's there's nothing
on this arm right here as opposed to

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,120
on this arm right here as opposed to
 

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,949
on this arm right here as opposed to
stay there stay where he was that's

146
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:53,959
stay there stay where he was that's
 

147
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,389
stay there stay where he was that's
where his intention was instead of me

148
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
where his intention was instead of me
 

149
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,670
where his intention was instead of me
being here you're still pushable on

150
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
being here you're still pushable on
 

151
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,430
being here you're still pushable on
there I can feel that so I

152
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,440
there I can feel that so I
 

153
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,030
there I can feel that so I
rotate right I rotate to where it's off

154
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
rotate right I rotate to where it's off
 

155
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,310
rotate right I rotate to where it's off
now it's off and then I move around it

156
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,320
now it's off and then I move around it
 

157
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,590
now it's off and then I move around it
let him fall into it and then I

158
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,600

 

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,550

project everything happened

160
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:17,560
project everything happened
 

161
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,550
project everything happened
here right

162
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560

 

163
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,030

there everything that happened after

164
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,040
there everything that happened after
 

165
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,829
there everything that happened after
that was just because I wanted his

166
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
that was just because I wanted his
 

167
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,910
that was just because I wanted his
balance to go that way so the same thing

168
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:28,920
balance to go that way so the same thing
 

169
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,269
balance to go that way so the same thing
he he

170
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:30,279
he he
 

171
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,590
he he
goes and I'm taking it off again he's

172
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
goes and I'm taking it off again he's
 

173
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,389
goes and I'm taking it off again he's
taking it off cuz he's over

174
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
taking it off cuz he's over
 

175
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,870
taking it off cuz he's over
there so he's coming in

176
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:41,880

 

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,829

boom right where he's grabbing by

185
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:12,550

way

186
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560

but and but don't try try to make him go
that way it's a different pushi angle

196
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:33,800
that way it's a different pushi angle
 

197
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,470
that way it's a different pushi angle
the entry is just the

198
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480

 

199
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:58,030

same just

00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040

 

201
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,590

smaller

202
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,600
smaller
 

203
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,629
smaller
but you have to free your shoulder in

204
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:02,639
but you have to free your shoulder in
 

205

but you have to free your shoulder in
the other one you could keep that tent

206
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:04,639
the other one you could keep that tent
 

207
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,590
the other one you could keep that tent
shoulder you see you can keep it and you

208
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
shoulder you see you can keep it and you
 

209
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,990
shoulder you see you can keep it and you
move it to zero pressure and you keep it

210
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,000
move it to zero pressure and you keep it
 

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,269
move it to zero pressure and you keep it
and you go and it looks like it's the

212
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
and you go and it looks like it's the
 

213
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,949
and you go and it looks like it's the
same but you see it doesn't

214
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:17,959
same but you see it doesn't
 

215
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,509
same but you see it doesn't
project on this one you can't keep that

216
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:20,519
project on this one you can't keep that
 

217
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,310
project on this one you can't keep that
stiff shoulder you have to loosen the

218
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,320
stiff shoulder you have to loosen the
 

219
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,870
stiff shoulder you have to loosen the

223
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,710

and that's hard to do because you know

224
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,720
and that's hard to do because you know
 

225
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,230
and that's hard to do because you know
he's coming and wo and you tense up in

226
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
he's coming and wo and you tense up in
 

227
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,430
he's coming and wo and you tense up in
in anticipation of that but you have to

228
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
in anticipation of that but you have to
 

229
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:27,870
in anticipation of that but you have to
be soft

230
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880

 

231
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:45,389

what

232
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:45,399

 

233
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,870

okay not really what I wanted to work on

234
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:47,880
okay not really what I wanted to work on
 

235
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,509
okay not really what I wanted to work on
but uh you're killing me okay it doesn't

236
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
but uh you're killing me okay it doesn't
 

237
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,269
but uh you're killing me okay it doesn't
matter which version you

238
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:54,279
matter which version you
 

239
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,790
matter which version you
do you cannot step you know what you

240
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:57,800
do you cannot step you know what you
 

241
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,629
do you cannot step you know what you
have to do when your

242
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,639
have to do when your
 

243
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,350
have to do when your
arms so you cannot step any old place

244
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,360
arms so you cannot step any old place
 

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,550
arms so you cannot step any old place
because your arms are dictating where

246
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:07,560
because your arms are dictating where
 

247
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,069
because your arms are dictating where
your foot can go so that your Center

248
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079
your foot can go so that your Center
 

249
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,030
your foot can go so that your Center
stays with your arm so if I go over here

250
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040
stays with your arm so if I go over here
 

251
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,870
stays with your arm so if I go over here
you see I'm on the outside I go over

252
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
you see I'm on the outside I go over
 

253
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,030
you see I'm on the outside I go over
here I'm not my Center is over here so I

254
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,040
here I'm not my Center is over here so I
 

255
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,590
here I'm not my Center is over here so I
have to step in a place where my hands

256
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
have to step in a place where my hands
 

257
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,350
have to step in a place where my hands
are on my center line but I have to step

258
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
are on my center line but I have to step
 

259
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,389
are on my center line but I have to step
in a way in a rate that I also get the

260
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
in a way in a rate that I also get the
 

261
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,870
in a way in a rate that I also get the
angle cancellation on his shoulder go

262
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
angle cancellation on his shoulder go
 

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,990
angle cancellation on his shoulder go
back and then I go around this

264
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
back and then I go around this
 

265
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,990
back and then I go around this
hand you see as opposed to into this

266
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,000
hand you see as opposed to into this
 

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,710
hand you see as opposed to into this
hand I don't want to go into the hand a

268
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
hand I don't want to go into the hand a
 

269
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,350
hand I don't want to go into the hand a
second time I have to go around the hand

270
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,360
second time I have to go around the hand
 

271
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,590
second time I have to go around the hand
so I go I I have to figure out where

272
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
so I go I I have to figure out where
 

273
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,430
so I go I I have to figure out where
that is it's not a free-for-all it's not

274
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
that is it's not a free-for-all it's not
 

275
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,629
that is it's not a free-for-all it's not
guessing and you can't go got his

276
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
guessing and you can't go got his
 

277
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,550
guessing and you can't go got his
shoulder down

278
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:57,560
shoulder down
 

279
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,269
shoulder down
no okay okay everything has to be set

280
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:02,279
no okay okay everything has to be set
 

281
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,069
no okay okay everything has to be set
up and be and beside the space the

282
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:07,079
up and be and beside the space the
 

283
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,470
up and be and beside the space the
timing is also governed that's what my

284
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
timing is also governed that's what my
 

285
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,470
timing is also governed that's what my
is time and space so this kind of looks

286
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
is time and space so this kind of looks
 

287
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,509
is time and space so this kind of looks
like it's going to be all right but if I

288
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:14,519
like it's going to be all right but if I
 

289
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,590
like it's going to be all right but if I
leave my hands behind I just did the

290
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
leave my hands behind I just did the
 

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,030
leave my hands behind I just did the
same thing the same mistake it goes up

292
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,040
same thing the same mistake it goes up
 

293
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,150
same thing the same mistake it goes up
into my

294
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,160
into my
 

295
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,310
into my
shoulder let's start

296
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320

 

297
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,150

again okay

298
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
again okay
 

299
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,430
again okay
add a particular Vector with a

300
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
add a particular Vector with a
 

301
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,710
add a particular Vector with a
particular weight rate of rotation and I

302
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
particular weight rate of rotation and I
 

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,230
particular weight rate of rotation and I
have to accomplish shoulder down and get

304
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
have to accomplish shoulder down and get
 

305
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,949
have to accomplish shoulder down and get
around here so that's where I go and

306
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
around here so that's where I go and
 

307
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,670
around here so that's where I go and
then it's easy

308
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,680

 

309
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,030

peasy bring some Consciousness to that

310
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
peasy bring some Consciousness to that
 

311
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,670
peasy bring some Consciousness to that
don't just keep stepping

312
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680

 

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:28,430

wherever

314
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,440

 

315

you got all that to
accomplish here we

320
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,000
accomplish here we
 

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:48,350
accomplish here we
go all right we're just going to get

322
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,360

 

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,389

here you you keep trying to turn this

324
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,399
here you you keep trying to turn this
 

325
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,590
here you you keep trying to turn this
turn that wrist do do you understand

326

327
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,670

that

328
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680

 

329

shape you see that you you need to get
 

333
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,470
shape you see that you you need to get
this but you think you do it by turning

334
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,480
this but you think you do it by turning
 

335
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,389
this but you think you do it by turning
the

336
