right let his center go through

180
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
right let his center go through
 

181
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,909
right let his center go through
and then his arm is going to come around

182
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
and then his arm is going to come around
 

183
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,749
and then his arm is going to come around
this way

184
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
this way
 

185
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,749
this way
you see because this is where his

186
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
you see because this is where his
 

187
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,550
you see because this is where his
balance is you see

188
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
balance is you see
 

189
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,230
balance is you see
pushing him back here you're going to

190
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
pushing him back here you're going to
 

191
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,670
pushing him back here you're going to
have to be stronger than him

192
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
have to be stronger than him
 

193
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,150
have to be stronger than him
this is this is where he wants to fall

194
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
this is this is where he wants to fall
 

195
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,390
this is this is where he wants to fall
so he comes in

196
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
so he comes in
 

197
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,990
so he comes in
it goes up up and then

198
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
it goes up up and then
 

199
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,189
it goes up up and then
this way let it go forward

200
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
this way let it go forward
 

201
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,430
this way let it go forward
around you

203
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,870

so he goes up around me here

204
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
so he goes up around me here
 

205
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,150
so he goes up around me here
this is where he wants to fall

206
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
this is where he wants to fall
 

207
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,070
this is where he wants to fall
and i'm only interested right now in the
