1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,230

so I'm going to Lunge for those biceps

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,240
so I'm going to Lunge for those biceps
 

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,549
so I'm going to Lunge for those biceps
right away okay I lunge and I have to be

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:11,559
right away okay I lunge and I have to be
 

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,590
right away okay I lunge and I have to be
able to come up do you see in one

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:15,600
able to come up do you see in one
 

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,590
able to come up do you see in one
movement not going to

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600

 

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,150

go okay you have to figure out where

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
go okay you have to figure out where
 

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,310
go okay you have to figure out where
your masses that you can do this okay

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
your masses that you can do this okay
 

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,709
your masses that you can do this okay
and then you climb

14
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:31,719
and then you climb
 

15
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,910
and then you climb
so grab

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
so grab
 

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,709
so grab
me you see you're pushing down okay and

18
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
me you see you're pushing down okay and
 

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,830
me you see you're pushing down okay and
now you're going to pry but you got to

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
now you're going to pry but you got to
 

21
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,950
now you're going to pry but you got to
take away that base okay and you have to

22
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
take away that base okay and you have to
 

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,990
take away that base okay and you have to
take tension away so it

24
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,000
take tension away so it
 

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,990
take tension away so it
slips you

26
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000

 

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,229

see show you what I

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
see show you what I
 

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,229
see show you what I
mean okay there's a lot of tension I'm

30
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:57,239
mean okay there's a lot of tension I'm
 

31
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,790
mean okay there's a lot of tension I'm
holding them up in my legs okay

32
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
holding them up in my legs okay
 

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,670
holding them up in my legs okay
well I start bringing this in from its

34
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
well I start bringing this in from its
 

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,429
well I start bringing this in from its
leverage point and then I just kind of

36
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
leverage point and then I just kind of
 

37
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,910
leverage point and then I just kind of
relax do you see that did you feel it I

38
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:10,920
relax do you see that did you feel it I
 

39
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,390
relax do you see that did you feel it I
don't have to do it long I have to

40
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
don't have to do it long I have to
 

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,510
don't have to do it long I have to
reduce the

42
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
reduce the
 

43
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,630
reduce the
friction that comes from the tension do

44
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
friction that comes from the tension do
 

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,590
friction that comes from the tension do
you get it otherwise I got to push a lot

46
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
you get it otherwise I got to push a lot
 

47
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,069
you get it otherwise I got to push a lot
as opposed to just clear the

48
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:24,079
as opposed to just clear the
 

49
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,390
as opposed to just clear the
leg and control the leg for the

50
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:27,400
leg and control the leg for the
 

51
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,389
leg and control the leg for the
homolateral knee slice got it so I go

52
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:31,399
homolateral knee slice got it so I go
 

53
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,670

85
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,550
sir when I say I do the same thing is I
release the tension the friction will go

86
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,560
release the tension the friction will go
 

87
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,710
release the tension the friction will go
away and it just slips on

88
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
away and it just slips on
 

89
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,790
away and it just slips on
okay try again okay so what we're

90
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
okay try again okay so what we're
 

91
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,710
okay try again okay so what we're
working on is that release of of tension

92
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:35,720
working on is that release of of tension
 

93
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,070
working on is that release of of tension
okay that you you you use it so I'm

94
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
okay that you you you use it so I'm
 

95
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,869
okay that you you you use it so I'm
coming up boom release down I go and

96
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
coming up boom release down I go and
 

97
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,990
coming up boom release down I go and
he's he's not going to just let me die

98
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,000
he's he's not going to just let me die
 

99
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,030
he's he's not going to just let me die
for that you see okay so a couple things

100
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
for that you see okay so a couple things
 

101
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,509
for that you see okay so a couple things
to

102
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
to
 

103
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,830
to
realize you just want one frame do

104
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:52,840
realize you just want one frame do
 

105
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,710
realize you just want one frame do
whatever you whatever you okay so he has

106
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
whatever you whatever you okay so he has
 

107
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,869
whatever you whatever you okay so he has
two frames there you see okay the first

108
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
two frames there you see okay the first
 

109
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,350
two frames there you see okay the first
thing to realize is that his strength is

110
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,360
thing to realize is that his strength is
 

111
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,949
thing to realize is that his strength is
in his elbows this part of his arm okay

112
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
in his elbows this part of his arm okay
 

113
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,550
in his elbows this part of his arm okay
stay there here is where he's very

114
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
stay there here is where he's very
 

115
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,149
stay there here is where he's very
strong but here he's not very strong he

116
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:09,159
strong but here he's not very strong he
 

117
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,910
strong but here he's not very strong he
had he made the mistake of putting his

118
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
had he made the mistake of putting his
 

119
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,509
had he made the mistake of putting his
hands together so when I drop it over

120
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
hands together so when I drop it over
 

121
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,309
hands together so when I drop it over
here do you see you have it and now I

122
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:17,319
here do you see you have it and now I
 

123
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:24,630
here do you see you have it and now I
can come into that same

124
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

125
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,589

technique okay so let's go to for I'm

126
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
technique okay so let's go to for I'm
 

127
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,710
technique okay so let's go to for I'm
here here you framed don't you're going

128
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
here here you framed don't you're going
 

129
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,390
here here you framed don't you're going
to want to push on that don't push on it

130
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
to want to push on that don't push on it
 

131
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,070
to want to push on that don't push on it
don't push there yield there yield there

132
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
don't push there yield there yield there
 

133
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,630
don't push there yield there yield there
and then the other shoulder comes down

134
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:41,640
and then the other shoulder comes down
 

135
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,030
and then the other shoulder comes down
you go on the

136
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
you go on the
 

137
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,270
you go on the
hands and then you come

in
 

141
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,429
in
okay that's why like when he's up

okay that's why like when he's up
 

143
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,830
okay that's why like when he's up
up your your power is not in your hand

144
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:56,840
up your your power is not in your hand
 

145
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,990
up your your power is not in your hand
it's in the this upper arm your upper

146
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,000
it's in the this upper arm your upper
 

147
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,309
it's in the this upper arm your upper
arm is where

148

arm is where
 

149
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,710
arm is where
okay the upper arm the

150
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
okay the upper arm the
 

151
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,069
okay the upper arm the
upper okay got

152
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,079
upper okay got
 

153
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:14,670
upper okay got
it let's try it

154
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,680

 

155
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,949

again

156
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
again
 

157
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,670
again
okay you you could always knock it off

158
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
okay you you could always knock it off
 

159
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,350
okay you you could always knock it off
but I want you to to learn the yielding

160
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,360
but I want you to to learn the yielding
 

161
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,870
but I want you to to learn the yielding
okay see his fingers right

162
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
okay see his fingers right
 

163
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,790
okay see his fingers right
here just like his hands are to his
