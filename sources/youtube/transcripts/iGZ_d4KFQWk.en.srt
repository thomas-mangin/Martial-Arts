00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480

 

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,390

Got it. You're like really hard. There

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
Got it. You're like really hard. There
 

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,669
Got it. You're like really hard. There
you go. Okay. And boom. And yeah, that

6
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
you go. Okay. And boom. And yeah, that
 

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,070
you go. Okay. And boom. And yeah, that
felt the whole target the whole time on

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
felt the whole target the whole time on
 

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,950
felt the whole target the whole time on
that punch.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960

 

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,429

That final thing is what you're doing in

12
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
That final thing is what you're doing in
 

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,029
That final thing is what you're doing in
mchous is you're checking his height and

14
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
mchous is you're checking his height and
 

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,590
mchous is you're checking his height and
it generates resistance to the ski and

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
it generates resistance to the ski and
 

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,430
it generates resistance to the ski and
now he can't ride the ski. Everything's

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
now he can't ride the ski. Everything's
 

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,389
now he can't ride the ski. Everything's
going to go into his body. Okay. Um so

20
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
going to go into his body. Okay. Um so
 

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,110
going to go into his body. Okay. Um so
we'll do a a we're going to take that

22
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
we'll do a a we're going to take that
 

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,190
we'll do a a we're going to take that
concept which you use all the time in

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
concept which you use all the time in
 

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,630
concept which you use all the time in
fighting. We're going to take it out of

26
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
fighting. We're going to take it out of
 

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,790
fighting. We're going to take it out of
makosh and then let's see if we can get

28
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
makosh and then let's see if we can get
 

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,229
makosh and then let's see if we can get
back to makosh. We have we have these

30
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
back to makosh. We have we have these
 

31
00:00:50,239 --> 00:01:01,029
back to makosh. We have we have these
technique I me right

32
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039

 

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,549

and that's exactly that he is being

34
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
and that's exactly that he is being
 

35
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,710
and that's exactly that he is being
checked. I feel his center. Do you see

36
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
checked. I feel his center. Do you see
 

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,149
checked. I feel his center. Do you see
that his energy is coming in? I check

38
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
that his energy is coming in? I check
 

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,550
that his energy is coming in? I check
his height and I hit into his center not

40
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
his height and I hit into his center not
 

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,910
his height and I hit into his center not
around his body. Okay. So when I drop my

42
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
around his body. Okay. So when I drop my
 

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,469
around his body. Okay. So when I drop my
hand, that is where the energy, the yong

44
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
hand, that is where the energy, the yong
 

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,390
hand, that is where the energy, the yong
aspect is brought to the ground. Okay?

46
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
aspect is brought to the ground. Okay?
 

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:39,190
aspect is brought to the ground. Okay?
And it's effortless.

48
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200

 

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,429

And it feels like you're hitting a wall.

50
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
And it feels like you're hitting a wall.
 

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,149
And it feels like you're hitting a wall.
Okay, one more time. Just feels like a

52
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
Okay, one more time. Just feels like a
 

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:59,749
Okay, one more time. Just feels like a
wall.

54
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759

 

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,190

What did it feel like when you got hit?

56
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
What did it feel like when you got hit?
 

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,630
What did it feel like when you got hit?
Do you know what I mean? Right. Run into

58
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
Do you know what I mean? Right. Run into
 

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,190
Do you know what I mean? Right. Run into
a wall. Yeah. It just feels like a wall.

60
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
a wall. Yeah. It just feels like a wall.
 

61
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,070
a wall. Yeah. It just feels like a wall.
Okay. Um

62
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay. Um
 

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,910
Okay. Um
and that I know like uh There's also no,

64
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
and that I know like uh There's also no,
 

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,350
and that I know like uh There's also no,
just like the point you were made, the

66
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
just like the point you were made, the
 

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,470
just like the point you were made, the
principle you were making, there's no

68
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
principle you were making, there's no
 

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,070
principle you were making, there's no
way for me to slink my way around it or

70
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
way for me to slink my way around it or
 

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,470
way for me to slink my way around it or
bleed energy out. I'm also like I pop

72
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
bleed energy out. I'm also like I pop
 

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,110
bleed energy out. I'm also like I pop
off. Yes. Yeah. So, for example, I've

74
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
off. Yes. Yeah. So, for example, I've
 

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,110
off. Yes. Yeah. So, for example, I've
seen that done this way for a little

76
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
seen that done this way for a little
 

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,910
seen that done this way for a little
bit. It's not going to work. Okay. But

78
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
bit. It's not going to work. Okay. But
 

79
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,229
bit. It's not going to work. Okay. But
pretend it does work. But you you you

80
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
pretend it does work. But you you you
 

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,550
pretend it does work. But you you you
you see like this.

82
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560

 

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,150

Do you know have you you know what I'm

84
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
Do you know have you you know what I'm
 

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,710
Do you know have you you know what I'm
talking about? And uh and then the guy

86
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
talking about? And uh and then the guy
 

87
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,949
talking about? And uh and then the guy
does the back break fall. The guy does

88
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
does the back break fall. The guy does
 

89
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,309
does the back break fall. The guy does
the back brake fall from there.

90
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
the back brake fall from there.
 

91
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,670
the back brake fall from there.
You see that? But you're that's setting

92
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
You see that? But you're that's setting
 

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,309
You see that? But you're that's setting
up that problem. Nothing is providing

94
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
up that problem. Nothing is providing
 

95
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,110
up that problem. Nothing is providing
resistance to the thrust. And so he he

96
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
resistance to the thrust. And so he he
 

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,550
resistance to the thrust. And so he he
would he could just run out. Okay. He

98
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
would he could just run out. Okay. He
 

99
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,270
would he could just run out. Okay. He
doesn't have to do that fall.

100
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280

 

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,030

Do you guys see that? So it's like it

102
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
Do you guys see that? So it's like it
 

103
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,229
Do you guys see that? So it's like it
doesn't work because they don't

104
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
doesn't work because they don't
 

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,390
doesn't work because they don't
understand the concept of what how you

106
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
understand the concept of what how you
 

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,790
understand the concept of what how you
actually generate force at impact and

108
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
actually generate force at impact and
 

109
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,030
actually generate force at impact and
solve the problem that he has all these

110
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
solve the problem that he has all these
 

111
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,190
solve the problem that he has all these
hinges in his body and he's bipedal and

112
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
hinges in his body and he's bipedal and
 

113
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,350
hinges in his body and he's bipedal and
he could just walk out of all of this

114
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
he could just walk out of all of this
 

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,270
he could just walk out of all of this
stuff. Okay. Or try to yield off energy.

116
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
stuff. Okay. Or try to yield off energy.
 

117
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,670
stuff. Okay. Or try to yield off energy.
That's what real people do. Okay. All

118
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
That's what real people do. Okay. All
 

119
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
That's what real people do. Okay. All
right.
