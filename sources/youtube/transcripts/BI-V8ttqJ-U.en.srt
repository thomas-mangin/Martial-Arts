That's where I catch it. Okay. And

60
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
That's where I catch it. Okay. And
 

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,069
That's where I catch it. Okay. And
that's very wooue. I did my thing. Her

62
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
that's very wooue. I did my thing. Her
 

63
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,270
that's very wooue. I did my thing. Her
hand ended in my hand. chasing after it

64
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
hand ended in my hand. chasing after it
 

65
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,429
hand ended in my hand. chasing after it
is not wooue. So you're if wooi is my

66
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
is not wooue. So you're if wooi is my
 

67
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,710
is not wooue. So you're if wooi is my
path to the reconciling of yin and yang

68
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
path to the reconciling of yin and yang
 

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,030
path to the reconciling of yin and yang
non wooue is going to jack up my

70
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
non wooue is going to jack up my
 

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,830
non wooue is going to jack up my
yin-yang reconciliation and that hence

72
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
yin-yang reconciliation and that hence
 

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,830
yin-yang reconciliation and that hence
it's lifting it while I'm trying to push

74
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
it's lifting it while I'm trying to push
 

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,190
it's lifting it while I'm trying to push
down. Okay. So try it again.

76
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200

 

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,500

Don't worry about the hand.

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,309

And then we got to find the the form.

82
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
And then we got to find the the form.
 

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,190
And then we got to find the the form.
Okay,

84
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
Okay,
 

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,750
Okay,
>> the form the form is necessary to teach

86
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
>> the form the form is necessary to teach
 

87
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,270
>> the form the form is necessary to teach
nonform

88
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
nonform
 

89
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,910
nonform
these two aspects

90
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
these two aspects
 

91
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,830
these two aspects
of that triune cosmogamy,

92
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
of that triune cosmogamy,
 

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,910
of that triune cosmogamy,
right? the the the uh

94
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920

 

95
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,830

the unknowable,

96
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
the unknowable,
 

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,949
the unknowable,
right? Immaterial and knowable material.

98
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
right? Immaterial and knowable material.
 

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,830
right? Immaterial and knowable material.
Okay, you have to learn uh and navigate.

100
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
Okay, you have to learn uh and navigate.
 

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,190
Okay, you have to learn uh and navigate.
You have to learn how to navigate

102
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
You have to learn how to navigate
 

103
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,309
You have to learn how to navigate
through this dichotomy. So form will

104
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
through this dichotomy. So form will
 

105
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,190
through this dichotomy. So form will
teach you nonform, nonform will teach

106
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
teach you nonform, nonform will teach
 

107
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,030
teach you nonform, nonform will teach
you form.

108
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
you form.
 

109
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,110
you form.
Okay? And so you have to do the form.

110
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
Okay? And so you have to do the form.
 

111
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,149
Okay? And so you have to do the form.
You can't do whatever. So when I say

You can't do whatever. So when I say
 

113
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,869
You can't do whatever. So when I say
don't try for the hand,

114
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
don't try for the hand,
 

115
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,509
don't try for the hand,

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,350
it doesn't look like it's there. That's
why you're forcing it. Just leave it

166
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
why you're forcing it. Just leave it
 

167
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,990

171
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,030
inward spiral. His arm, his wrist ends

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,040
up right there. Okay? You don't you
 

173
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,270

don't need to do that stuff. That stuff

174
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
don't need to do that stuff. That stuff
 

175
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,590
don't need to do that stuff. That stuff
is not Marshall. You can't do that in

176
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
is not Marshall. You can't do that in
 

177
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,029
is not Marshall. You can't do that in
real life. It's energetically incorrect.

178
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
real life. It's energetically incorrect.
 

179
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,029
real life. It's energetically incorrect.
Um,

180
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
Um,
 

181
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,909
Um,
and whenever you see it working, you

182
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
and whenever you see it working, you
 

183
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,070
and whenever you see it working, you
have a uk who's leaving his hand up

184
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
have a uk who's leaving his hand up
 

185
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,469
have a uk who's leaving his hand up
there for you to do it. Do do you get

186
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
there for you to do it. Do do you get
 

187
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,950
there for you to do it. Do do you get
that? The reason it's not working on you

188
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
that? The reason it's not working on you
 

189
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,350
that? The reason it's not working on you
guys is because you're not trained to

190
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
guys is because you're not trained to
 

191
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,189
guys is because you're not trained to
leave your hand there. If you're pushing

192
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
leave your hand there. If you're pushing
 

193
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,430
leave your hand there. If you're pushing
my hand down, my hand goes down. So,

194
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
my hand down, my hand goes down. So,
 

195
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,510
my hand down, my hand goes down. So,
that's what's happening there. Okay. But

196
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
that's what's happening there. Okay. But
 

197
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,150
that's what's happening there. Okay. But
whenever you see, you know, Grandmaster

198
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
whenever you see, you know, Grandmaster
 

199
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,590
whenever you see, you know, Grandmaster
Shihan do it, you have some UK who

200
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
Shihan do it, you have some UK who
 

201
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,749
Shihan do it, you have some UK who
leaves his hand up there for him to do

202
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
leaves his hand up there for him to do
 

203
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,990
leaves his hand up there for him to do
that goofy thing. But no one fights like

204
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
that goofy thing. But no one fights like
 

205
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,870
that goofy thing. But no one fights like
that. Okay? And it doesn't it's a

206
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
that. Okay? And it doesn't it's a
 

207
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,749
that. Okay? And it doesn't it's a
violation of trapping rules. So trapping

208
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
violation of trapping rules. So trapping
 

209
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,189
violation of trapping rules. So trapping
rules are you end up in my trap. I

210
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
rules are you end up in my trap. I
 

211
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,830
rules are you end up in my trap. I
cannot chase you with my trap. You end

212
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
cannot chase you with my trap. You end
 

213
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,629
cannot chase you with my trap. You end
up in the trap. So imagine like a bear

214
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
up in the trap. So imagine like a bear
 

215
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,510
up in the trap. So imagine like a bear
trap and you leave the trap there and

216
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
trap and you leave the trap there and
 

217
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,350
trap and you leave the trap there and
the bear steps in the trap. You don't

218
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
the bear steps in the trap. You don't
 

219
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,430
the bear steps in the trap. You don't
walk around with the trap trying to

220
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
walk around with the trap trying to
 

221
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,070
walk around with the trap trying to
catch the bears. Okay? That's not how we

222
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
catch the bears. Okay? That's not how we
 

223
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,590
catch the bears. Okay? That's not how we
trap in any martial art except the la

224
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
trap in any martial art except the la
 

225
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
trap in any martial art except the la
land of modern iikido. Okay.
