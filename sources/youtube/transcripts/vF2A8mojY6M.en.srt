00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,550

so if if he's pushing on me right and I

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
so if if he's pushing on me right and I
 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,309
so if if he's pushing on me right and I
send his energy down to the ground he's

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
send his energy down to the ground he's
 

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,830
send his energy down to the ground he's
pushing on me

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:10,840

 

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,390

right all right same thing if I punch

8
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
right all right same thing if I punch
 

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,710
right all right same thing if I punch
him but not here that energy comes back

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
him but not here that energy comes back
 

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,109
him but not here that energy comes back
down to the

12
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:18,119
down to the
 

13
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,790
down to the
ground all right we're on the kick now

14
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:21,800
ground all right we're on the kick now
 

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,230
ground all right we're on the kick now
okay so we're we're going to do our KCK

16
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,240
okay so we're we're going to do our KCK
 

17
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,349
okay so we're we're going to do our KCK
here and my drill is contact and then

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
here and my drill is contact and then
 

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,950
here and my drill is contact and then
continue

that that mass is resistance it will

22
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
that that mass is resistance it will
 

23
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,630
that that mass is resistance it will
come down this way and I'll project it

24
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
come down this way and I'll project it
 

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,229
come down this way and I'll project it
out so I'm not kicking it going through

26
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
out so I'm not kicking it going through
 

27
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,150
out so I'm not kicking it going through
the Dynamics and then the ground

Vector okay so he's not picking up his

30
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:46,600
Vector okay so he's not picking up his
 

31
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,869
Vector okay so he's not picking up his
leg for me that's not what he's doing

leg for me that's not what he's doing
 

33
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,950
leg for me that's not what he's doing
I'm able to just move his leg from

34
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm able to just move his leg from
 

35
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,549
I'm able to just move his leg from
here okay that is enough base to

36
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:55,559
here okay that is enough base to
 

37
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,910
here okay that is enough base to
generate that energy let's

38
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
generate that energy let's
 

39
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,430
generate that energy let's
go

what I was trying to show he's pushing

94
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
what I was trying to show he's pushing
 

95
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,670
what I was trying to show he's pushing
you know these drills he's pushing he's

96
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:02,680
you know these drills he's pushing he's
 

97
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,470
you know these drills he's pushing he's
pushing he's pushing right you know

pushing he's pushing right you know
 

99
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,270
pushing he's pushing right you know
those drills okay you're just doing it

100
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,280
those drills okay you're just doing it
 

101
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,270
those drills okay you're just doing it
ballistically and from not that position

102
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
ballistically and from not that position
 

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,710
ballistically and from not that position
this is still energy I'm grounding

104
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
this is still energy I'm grounding
 

105
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,070
this is still energy I'm grounding
it trying to move that is energy I

106
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,080
it trying to move that is energy I
 

107
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,910
it trying to move that is energy I
ground it so I I take that resistance

108
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
ground it so I I take that resistance
 

109
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,390
ground it so I I take that resistance
put it in that foot and let it

110
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,400
put it in that foot and let it
 

111
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,670

right okay so keep going
way ground that energy in your foot

120
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
way ground that energy in your foot
 

121
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,149
way ground that energy in your foot
you're just trying to move it

122
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:45,159

 

123
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,869

ballistically ground that first feel it

124
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:47,879
ballistically ground that first feel it
 

125
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,390
ballistically ground that first feel it
into your foot

126
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
into your foot
 

127
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,470
into your foot
okay A little

128
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,480

 

129
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,670

better put this in your

130
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
better put this in your
 

131
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,670
better put this in your
foot a little better try to do it with

132
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
foot a little better try to do it with
 

133
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,149
foot a little better try to do it with
the kick though get rid of that

134
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159

 

135
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,910

hook and see you bounced off of it

136
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920

punch uh you can punch with shoulder oh

172
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,199
punch uh you can punch with shoulder oh
 

173
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,749
punch uh you can punch with shoulder oh
you punch with shoulder and hip rotation

174
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:12,759
you punch with shoulder and hip rotation
 

175
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,350
you punch with shoulder and hip rotation
that that punch feels different from

176
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
that that punch feels different from
 

177
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,070
that that punch feels different from
that punch you see it's not the same

178
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
that punch you see it's not the same
 

179
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,230
that punch you see it's not the same
punch so likewise we're doing this low

180
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
punch so likewise we're doing this low
 

181
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,830
punch so likewise we're doing this low
round you can hit this back pretty

round you can hit this back pretty
 

183
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,830
round you can hit this back pretty
pretty athletic that's not the same kick

184
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:26,840
pretty athletic that's not the same kick
 

185
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,309

it's not the same kick okay so I'm going

186
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:29,319
it's not the same kick okay so I'm going
 

187
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,749
it's not the same kick okay so I'm going
to have that resistance come into the

188
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
to have that resistance come into the
 

189
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,830
to have that resistance come into the
base totally displace his

190
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:38,840

 

191
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,309

good round the back foot boom good
that's

246
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:35,879
that's
 

247
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,670
that's
it

see your upper body comes back okay
 

265
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,390
see your upper body comes back okay
energy goes against the kick is taking

266
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
energy goes against the kick is taking
 

267
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,270
energy goes against the kick is taking
energy from the kick you'll feel strong

268
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
energy from the kick you'll feel strong
 

269
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,990
energy from the kick you'll feel strong
but you won't be

270
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,000

 

271
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,749

strong okay so energy goes across again

272
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:18,759
strong okay so energy goes across again
 

273
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,070
strong okay so energy goes across again
it's not how powerful I feel this makes

274
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
it's not how powerful I feel this makes
 

275
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,390
it's not how powerful I feel this makes
me feel a lot of torqueing here and it

276
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
me feel a lot of torqueing here and it
 

277
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,869
me feel a lot of torqueing here and it
makes me feel powerful but my Mass is

278
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
makes me feel powerful but my Mass is
 

279
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,589
makes me feel powerful but my Mass is
going out of the force equation it's not

280
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
going out of the force equation it's not
 

281
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,790
going out of the force equation it's not
actually powerful okay so uh everything

282
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:33,800
actually powerful okay so uh everything
 

283
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,269
actually powerful okay so uh everything
has to be going in the

284
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:36,279
has to be going in the
 

285
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,310
has to be going in the
direction that the kick is going except

286
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,320

is not not trying to fight anyone just
 

297
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,590
is not not trying to fight anyone just
trying to have all my energy you

298
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,600
trying to have all my energy you
 

299
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,310
trying to have all my energy you
go into this motion

300
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
go into this motion
 

301
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,630

not okay even a tiny
one that that little one that's going to

304
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
one that that little one that's going to
 

305
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,230
one that that little one that's going to
take energy out of the K so everything

306
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
take energy out of the K so everything
 

307
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,350
take energy out of the K so everything
is

308
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
is
 

309
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,230
