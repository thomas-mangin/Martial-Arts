00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,150

okay so you can see even in the

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
okay so you can see even in the

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,430
okay so you can see even in the
the triangle get up

00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440

 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,589

from a marshall point of view you start

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
from a marshall point of view you start
 

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,430
from a marshall point of view you start
doing weird things

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440

 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,710

but they don't feel weird to you because

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
but they don't feel weird to you because
 

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,189
but they don't feel weird to you because
you don't know the martial context you

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
you don't know the martial context you
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,230
you don't know the martial context you
can't

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
can't
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,109
can't
imagine all the things that an aggressor

16
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
imagine all the things that an aggressor
 

17
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,189
imagine all the things that an aggressor
can do to you

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
can do to you
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,509
can do to you
so you don't know when you deviate from

20
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
so you don't know when you deviate from
 

21
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,269
so you don't know when you deviate from
the form

22
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
the form
 

23
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,389
the form
that you are partially vulnerable

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
that you are partially vulnerable
 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,709
that you are partially vulnerable
there's no context for your movement

26
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
there's no context for your movement
 

27
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,030
there's no context for your movement
and the only thing you have to rely on

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
and the only thing you have to rely on
 

29
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,750
and the only thing you have to rely on
is your

30
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
is your
 

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,310
is your
capacity to replicate the teacher's form

32
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
capacity to replicate the teacher's form
 

33
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,830
capacity to replicate the teacher's form
but that's nearly impossible

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
but that's nearly impossible
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,389
but that's nearly impossible
it's it's and i'm not talking about your

36
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
it's it's and i'm not talking about your
 

37
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,150
it's it's and i'm not talking about your
body is different from your teacher's

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
body is different from your teacher's
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,590
body is different from your teacher's
body

40
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
body
 

41
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,389
body
that's that's not what it is that you

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
that's that's not what it is that you
 

43
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,350
that's that's not what it is that you
see

44
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
see
 

45
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,950
see
the technique from the ego tripartite

46
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
the technique from the ego tripartite
 

47
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,950
the technique from the ego tripartite
it is constantly being interpreted

48
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
it is constantly being interpreted
 

49
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,670
it is constantly being interpreted
and placed in your own egocentric

50
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
and placed in your own egocentric
 

51
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,630
and placed in your own egocentric
context so

52
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
context so
 

53
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,190
context so
it's placed in the context that

54
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
it's placed in the context that
 

55
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,990
it's placed in the context that
redefines

56
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
redefines
 

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,670
redefines
the eye and so

58
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
the eye and so
 

59
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,429
the eye and so
the art is outside of the ego tripeptide

60
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
the art is outside of the ego tripeptide
 

61
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,390
the art is outside of the ego tripeptide
so that

62
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
so that
 

63
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,469
so that
deviation is always that it's always a

64
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
deviation is always that it's always a
 

65
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,590
deviation is always that it's always a
deviation

66
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600

 

67
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,630

so you can either

68
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
so you can either
 

69
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,469
so you can either
take decades of

70
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
take decades of
 

71
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,350
take decades of
entering yourself into sparring context

72
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
entering yourself into sparring context
 

73
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,390
entering yourself into sparring context
where you realize

74
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
where you realize
 

75
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,510
where you realize
oh god my head's too low or oh

76
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
oh god my head's too low or oh
 

77
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,950
oh god my head's too low or oh
man i'm i'm heel weighted or oh

78
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
man i'm i'm heel weighted or oh
 

79
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,590
man i'm i'm heel weighted or oh
i shouldn't be going forward right now

80
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
i shouldn't be going forward right now
 

81
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,630
i shouldn't be going forward right now
um

82
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
um
 

83
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,109
um
or you could just replicate the

84
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
or you could just replicate the
 

85
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,069
or you could just replicate the
teacher's

86
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
teacher's
 

87
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,190
teacher's

91
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,030

but i find a happy medium between

but i find a happy medium between

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,550
but i find a happy medium between
understanding the martial context

94
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
understanding the martial context
 

95
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,389
understanding the martial context
it's very important that you understand

96
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
it's very important that you understand
 

97
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,389
it's very important that you understand
the martial context because

98
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
the martial context because
 

99
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,710
the martial context because
you're going to fill in the blank just

100
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
you're going to fill in the blank just
 

101
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,869
you're going to fill in the blank just
automatically you always will

102
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
automatically you always will
 

103
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,390
automatically you always will
you will fill in that blank that context

104
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
you will fill in that blank that context
 

105
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,030
you will fill in that blank that context
without the marshall experience it's

106
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
without the marshall experience it's
 

107
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,869
without the marshall experience it's
going to be wrong

108
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
going to be wrong
 

109
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,270
going to be wrong
it's going to be a deviation from the

110
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
it's going to be a deviation from the
 

111
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,550
it's going to be a deviation from the
get-go anyways it's going to be wrong

112
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
get-go anyways it's going to be wrong
 

113
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,589
get-go anyways it's going to be wrong
so let's look at

114
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
so let's look at
 

115
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,790
so let's look at
the tessabaki from yesterday okay

the tessabaki from yesterday okay
 

117
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,270
the tessabaki from yesterday okay
let's look at it marshally and the first

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
let's look at it marshally and the first
 

119
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,790
let's look at it marshally and the first
thing to note

120
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
thing to note
 

121
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,110

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
so you are working on that you do have
 

175
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,509
so you are working on that you do have
an angle cancellation on that arm you

176
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
an angle cancellation on that arm you
 

177
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,910
an angle cancellation on that arm you
have to understand basic concepts

178
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
have to understand basic concepts
 

179
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,589
have to understand basic concepts
of checking the guy out through

180
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
of checking the guy out through
 

181
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,509
of checking the guy out through
diagonals that cut through his height

182
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
diagonals that cut through his height
 

183
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,589
diagonals that cut through his height
width and depth

184
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
width and depth
 

185
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,309
width and depth
and then you also have this notion of

186
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
and then you also have this notion of
 

187
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,070
and then you also have this notion of

from two points
 

195
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,910
from two points
by controlling i mean that i am

196
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920

when you're doing contact you're going
to have that same angle

240
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
to have that same angle
 

241
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,070
to have that same angle
of cancellation you're going to have the

242
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
of cancellation you're going to have the
 

243
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,230
of cancellation you're going to have the
same adhesion

244
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
same adhesion
 

245
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,310
same adhesion
which you'll passing it from one arm to

246
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
which you'll passing it from one arm to
 

247
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,310
which you'll passing it from one arm to
the other arm to the head

the question was ask her are you are you
are you pulling him

262
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
are you pulling him
 

263
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,309
are you pulling him
no you're not calling him even though

264
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
no you're not calling him even though
 

265
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,550
no you're not calling him even though
he's gripping

266
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
he's gripping
 

267
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,950
he's gripping
i'm not using his script so i'm not

268
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
i'm not using his script so i'm not
 

269
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,710
i'm not using his script so i'm not
using this

270
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
using this
 

271
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,629
using this
picture move that he has here and the

272
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
picture move that he has here and the
 

273
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,189
picture move that he has here and the
width of my hand to make him move

274
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
width of my hand to make him move
 

275
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,230
width of my hand to make him move
so he can he can open his hand and

276
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
so he can he can open his hand and
 

277
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,510
so he can he can open his hand and
you can do it that's the i key

278
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
you can do it that's the i key
 

279
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,230
you can do it that's the i key
the internal aspect okay i have to be

280
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
the internal aspect okay i have to be
 

281
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,790
the internal aspect okay i have to be
able to adhere causes adhesion

282
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
able to adhere causes adhesion
 

283
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,390
able to adhere causes adhesion
and it was that that lets me

284
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
and it was that that lets me
 

285
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,350
and it was that that lets me
get the two points those two points are

286
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
get the two points those two points are
 

287
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,950
get the two points those two points are
controlling him

288
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
controlling him
 

289
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,189
controlling him
so i don't have to do this arm

290
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
so i don't have to do this arm
 

291
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,110
so i don't have to do this arm
manipulation

292
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
manipulation
 

293
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,510
manipulation
if i am required to do the arm

294
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
if i am required to do the arm
 

295
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,110
if i am required to do the arm
manipulation

296
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
manipulation
 

297
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,150
manipulation
that means i need to control his arms

298
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
that means i need to control his arms
 

299
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,110
that means i need to control his arms
combatively and that only makes sense to

300
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
combatively and that only makes sense to
 

301
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,230

somebody

302
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
somebody
 

303
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,309
somebody
who does not train combatively because

304
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
who does not train combatively because
 

305
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,550
who does not train combatively because
when you do you'll find out that is

306
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
when you do you'll find out that is
 

307
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,390
when you do you'll find out that is
extremely hard to do

308
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
extremely hard to do
 

309
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,589
extremely hard to do
to get someone's arm okay every

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
viability is going way down
 

345
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,830
viability is going way down
and that's not the

346
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
and that's not the
 

347
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,230
and that's not the
the strategy as i said is to manipulate

348
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
the strategy as i said is to manipulate
 

349
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,070
the strategy as i said is to manipulate
the relationship between his center of

350
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
the relationship between his center of
 

351
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,830
the relationship between his center of
gravity his line of gravity and his base

352

gravity his line of gravity and his base
 

353
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,029

of support

354
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039

355
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,550

not to manipulate his arm

356
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
not to manipulate his arm
 

357
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,869
not to manipulate his arm
so when we go to this technique

358
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
so when we go to this technique
 

359
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,710
so when we go to this technique
this is the same thing you have to have

360
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
this is the same thing you have to have
 

361
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,950
this is the same thing you have to have
that ik adhesion there you're not grip

362
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
that ik adhesion there you're not grip
 

363
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,830
that ik adhesion there you're not grip
dependent

364
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840

 

365
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,110

but on the other arm here you don't have

366
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
but on the other arm here you don't have
 

367
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,830
but on the other arm here you don't have
it

368
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
it
 

369
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,150
it
at all you don't you don't grab them

370
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
at all you don't you don't grab them
 

371
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,510
at all you don't you don't grab them
you're doing the same lifestyle adhesion

372
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520

 

373
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,709

so i decision adhesions

374
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719

 

375
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,350

and then i go back to the same thing

376
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
and then i go back to the same thing
 

377
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,750
and then i go back to the same thing
just

378
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
just
 

379
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,750
just
two points of control but not grabbing

380
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760

381
00:08:43,760 --> 00:09:02,150
two points of control but not grabbing
not opening from back here

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160

 

383
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:20,950

that was it you worked the drone

this part here is another thing you're

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,389
in a way concentric with the art so
it's got to abide by yin yang theory and

516
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:49,399
it's got to abide by yin yang theory and
 

517
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,829
it's got to abide by yin yang theory and
non-contestation

518
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
non-contestation
 

519
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,790
non-contestation
okay so because you have this forward

520
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
okay so because you have this forward
 

521
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,470
okay so because you have this forward
progress to him

522
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
progress to him
 

523
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,829
progress to him
when you do this little circle here

524
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
when you do this little circle here
 

525
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,269
when you do this little circle here
his forward progress

526
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
his forward progress
 

527
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,710
his forward progress
is going to start creating

528
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
is going to start creating
 

529
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,310
is going to start creating
um an adhesion on my hand

530
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
um an adhesion on my hand
 

531
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,910
um an adhesion on my hand
as is doing a kind of centripetal

532
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
as is doing a kind of centripetal
 

533
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,190
as is doing a kind of centripetal
pattern in this spiral okay so

534
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
pattern in this spiral okay so
 

535
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,710
pattern in this spiral okay so
it's not that i tilt his spine

536
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
it's not that i tilt his spine
 

537
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,389
it's not that i tilt his spine
it's that i'm going to do this

538
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
it's that i'm going to do this
 

539
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,430
it's that i'm going to do this
little thing like this you see

540
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
little thing like this you see
 

541
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,269
little thing like this you see
i want to feel his centrifugal energy

542
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
i want to feel his centrifugal energy
 

543
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,629
i want to feel his centrifugal energy
harmonizing or being capitalized upon

544
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
harmonizing or being capitalized upon
 

545
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,750
harmonizing or being capitalized upon
with my centripetal energy do you get

546
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
with my centripetal energy do you get
 

547
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,230
with my centripetal energy do you get
that

548
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
that
 

549
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,590
that
so that makes this one wrong

550
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600

 

551
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,710

right and that also

552
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
right and that also
 

553
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,990
right and that also
makes these tilting things right

554
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
makes these tilting things right
 

555
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,430
makes these tilting things right
and again if you spar you realize

556
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
and again if you spar you realize
 

557
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,269
and again if you spar you realize
oh i tilted the guy but i can't do

558
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
oh i tilted the guy but i can't do
 

559
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,110
oh i tilted the guy but i can't do
anything with it you know or

560
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
anything with it you know or
 

561
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,110
anything with it you know or
i can't tilt the guy because he just let

562
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
i can't tilt the guy because he just let
 

563
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,949
i can't tilt the guy because he just let
go of the arm control that i had

564
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
go of the arm control that i had
 

565
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,590
go of the arm control that i had
things like that okay so i'm doing the

566
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
things like that okay so i'm doing the
 

567
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,550
things like that okay so i'm doing the
first

568
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
first
 

569
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,990
first
like adhesion arm pass spinal control

570
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
like adhesion arm pass spinal control
 

571
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,350
like adhesion arm pass spinal control
and getting his

572
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
and getting his
 

573
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,470
and getting his
forward process to generate

574
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
forward process to generate
 

575
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,790
forward process to generate
an integration with my centripetal

576
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
an integration with my centripetal
 

577
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,069
an integration with my centripetal
energy okay

578
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
energy okay
 

579
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:26,790
energy okay
so one two four

580
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800

 

581
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,430

one forward

582
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,440

 

583
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:42,710

585
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,670

and that way this arm is does not become

586
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
and that way this arm is does not become
 

587
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,829
and that way this arm is does not become
so mechanically a slave to the arm

588
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
so mechanically a slave to the arm
 

589
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,030

okay because it's not really the major

592
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320

619
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,710

let's go backwards yep so we'll leave

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
let's go backwards yep so we'll leave
 

621
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,470
let's go backwards yep so we'll leave
the head control off for a second

622
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
the head control off for a second
 

623

let's just look at this arms okay so

624
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
let's just look at this arms okay so
 

625
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,189
let's just look at this arms okay so
his he has the um

626
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
his he has the um
 

627
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,189
his he has the um
hinge at the elbow and he and then he

628
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
hinge at the elbow and he and then he
 

629
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,189
hinge at the elbow and he and then he
has this ball socket joint

630
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
has this ball socket joint
 

631
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,949
has this ball socket joint
at his shoulder okay and so

632
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
at his shoulder okay and so
 

633
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,310
at his shoulder okay and so
uh when when you're below the elbow

634
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
uh when when you're below the elbow
 

635
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,550
uh when when you're below the elbow
and you try to control him it's very

636
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
and you try to control him it's very
 

637
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,910
and you try to control him it's very
easy for him

638
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
easy for him
 

639
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,550
easy for him
to open his arm you see he absorbs the

640
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
to open his arm you see he absorbs the
 

641
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,949
to open his arm you see he absorbs the
energy that you had checking him

642
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
energy that you had checking him
 

643
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,550
energy that you had checking him
and then the same thing when i go uh

644
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
and then the same thing when i go uh
 

645
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,470
and then the same thing when i go uh
above the elbow but i'm on top of his

646
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
above the elbow but i'm on top of his
 

647
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,189
above the elbow but i'm on top of his
arm the ball and socket joint

648
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
arm the ball and socket joint
 

649
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,910
arm the ball and socket joint
doesn't give me the control i want so

650
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
doesn't give me the control i want so
 

651
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,949
doesn't give me the control i want so
when i control

652
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
when i control
 

653
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,990
when i control
his body i'm going to control it

654
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
his body i'm going to control it
 

655
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,710
his body i'm going to control it
here above the elbow making that joint

656
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
here above the elbow making that joint
 

657
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,509
here above the elbow making that joint
irrelevant

658
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
irrelevant
 

659
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,030
irrelevant
to what i'm doing and then uh

660
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
to what i'm doing and then uh
 

661
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,069
to what i'm doing and then uh
near the ball and socket joint so that

662
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
near the ball and socket joint so that
 

663
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,710
near the ball and socket joint so that
as it as it moves all around it's i can

664
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
as it as it moves all around it's i can
 

665
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,150
as it as it moves all around it's i can
stay with it

666
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
stay with it
 

667
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,470
stay with it
do you see it doesn't immediately go

668
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
do you see it doesn't immediately go
 

669
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,910
do you see it doesn't immediately go
underneath me

670
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
underneath me
 

671
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,590
underneath me
so here and then in the same way as on

672
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
so here and then in the same way as on
 

673
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,030
so here and then in the same way as on
the neck control

674
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
the neck control
 

675
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,150
the neck control
i'm using the

676
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
i'm using the
 

677
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,069
i'm using the
harmonization i'm doing between his

678
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079

681
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,390
