best thing is can you learn to think for

42
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
best thing is can you learn to think for
 

43
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,789
best thing is can you learn to think for
yourselves okay because my my position

44
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
yourselves okay because my my position
 

45
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,270
yourselves okay because my my position
is if you can learn to think for

46
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,280
is if you can learn to think for
 

47
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,429
is if you can learn to think for
yourselves then uh you might end up

yourselves then uh you might end up
exactly where I am okay it's just a very

50
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
exactly where I am okay it's just a very
 

51
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,230
exactly where I am okay it's just a very
long roundabout thing whereas if you

52
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
long roundabout thing whereas if you
 

53
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,109
long roundabout thing whereas if you
practice devotion it's the quickest

54
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
practice devotion it's the quickest
 

55
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,030
practice devotion it's the quickest
route that's that's why I did it that

56
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,040
route that's that's why I did it that
 

57
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,310
route that's that's why I did it that
way okay so learning how to think I was

00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:32,439
really quite surprised by a lot of those
 

61
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,469
really quite surprised by a lot of those
responses to be honest on the first

62

look and he's
grabbing uh where we left off is it's

104
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,280
grabbing uh where we left off is it's
 

105
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,869
grabbing uh where we left off is it's
not him grabbing and striking that just

106
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
not him grabbing and striking that just
 

107
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,430
not him grabbing and striking that just
doesn't work okay it's me being grabbed

108
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
doesn't work okay it's me being grabbed
 

109
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,509
doesn't work okay it's me being grabbed
and me entering and him blocking the

110
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:40,519
and me entering and him blocking the
 

111
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,670
and me entering and him blocking the

on so if he grabs and is pulling me in
 

115
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,630
on so if he grabs and is pulling me in
you'll see that his

116
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
you'll see that his
 

117
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,550
you'll see that his
elbow

118
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
elbow
 

119
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,550
elbow
goes from straight cuz he reached for

120
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:55,560
goes from straight cuz he reached for
 

121
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,949
goes from straight cuz he reached for
the grab and then his elbow bends this

122
00:02:59,949 --> 00:02:59,959
the grab and then his elbow bends this
 

123
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,910
the grab and then his elbow bends this
we call this anchoring okay and the

124
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:02,920
we call this anchoring okay and the
 

125
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,630
we call this anchoring okay and the
stronger he wants to be the more the

126
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
stronger he wants to be the more the
 

127
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,309
stronger he wants to be the more the
elbow stays close to his rib cage and

128
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:09,319
elbow stays close to his rib cage and
 

129
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,509
elbow stays close to his rib cage and
the more down it goes that's going to

130
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
the more down it goes that's going to
 

131
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,869
the more down it goes that's going to
give him the most power the more his

132
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:13,879
give him the most power the more his
 

133
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,309
give him the most power the more his
elbow flares which people can pull like

134
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
elbow flares which people can pull like
 

135
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,670
elbow flares which people can pull like
that the less his elbows anchored the

136
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680
that the less his elbows anchored the
 

137
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,910
that the less his elbows anchored the
less power he has okay so we won't train

138
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
less power he has okay so we won't train
 

139
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,990
less power he has okay so we won't train
for the the idiot we won't train for

140
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
for the the idiot we won't train for
 

141
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,390
for the the idiot we won't train for

269
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,230
my arm up okay we'll do it from the
other side in chasing you can see both

270
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
other side in chasing you can see both
 

271
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,510
other side in chasing you can see both
angles just in the pull no he's blocking

272
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,520
angles just in the pull no he's blocking
 

273
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,749
angles just in the pull no he's blocking
in the pole itself one more

274
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
in the pole itself one more
 

275
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,790
in the pole itself one more
time okay and we'll try that one so they

276
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
time okay and we'll try that one so they
 

277

fists
 

281
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,510
fists
now as I plot this in space but it's it

282
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:16,520
now as I plot this in space but it's it
 

283
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,950
now as I plot this in space but it's it
should be obvious it's just appar

284
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
should be obvious it's just appar
 

285
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,309
should be obvious it's just appar
obviously it wasn't obvious okay and

286
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:21,319
obviously it wasn't obvious okay and
 

287
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,629
obviously it wasn't obvious okay and
then that's how you get people entering

288
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
then that's how you get people entering
 

289
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,629
then that's how you get people entering
in coming underneath like that just

290
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
in coming underneath like that just
 

291
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,270
in coming underneath like that just
doesn't work okay but if you pay

292
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
doesn't work okay but if you pay
 

293
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,670
doesn't work okay but if you pay
attention mention why doesn't it work

294
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
attention mention why doesn't it work
 

295
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,029
attention mention why doesn't it work
okay to Anchor my

296
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
okay to Anchor my
 

297
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,029
okay to Anchor my
elbow my fist has to descend so if you

298
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
elbow my fist has to descend so if you
 

299
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,189
elbow my fist has to descend so if you
plot it in the vertical plane my fist is

300
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
plot it in the vertical plane my fist is
 

301
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,510
plot it in the vertical plane my fist is
coming

302

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,120
elbow power and he's trying to use his
 

325
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,149
elbow power and he's trying to use his
wrist power on that you'll lose that

326
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,159
wrist power on that you'll lose that
 

327
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,110
wrist power on that you'll lose that
every time okay that's why it doesn't

328
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
every time okay that's why it doesn't
 

329
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,830
every time okay that's why it doesn't
work that's a Yong Yong Clash why is it

330
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
work that's a Yong Yong Clash why is it
 

331
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,390
work that's a Yong Yong Clash why is it
not noticed because the U is

332
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
not noticed because the U is
 

333
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,149
not noticed because the U is
choreographing The Clash away okay so

334
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:29,159
choreographing The Clash away okay so
 

335
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,830
choreographing The Clash away okay so
what do we have to do

336
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:30,840
what do we have to do
 

337
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,110
what do we have to do
instead I can't come underneath the arm

338
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
instead I can't come underneath the arm
 

339
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,469
instead I can't come underneath the arm
so I go over the arm he's pulling I come

340
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:37,479
so I go over the arm he's pulling I come
 

341
00:08:37,479 --> 00:09:02,990
so I go over the arm he's pulling I come
here

342
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,000

 

343
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,150

okay try that one try it all right so a

344
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
okay try that one try it all right so a
 

345
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,150
okay try that one try it all right so a
kind of insert here because his his

346
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,160
kind of insert here because his his
 

347
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,509
kind of insert here because his his
elbow is anchoring the fist goes down as

348
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:12,519
elbow is anchoring the fist goes down as
 

349
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,069
elbow is anchoring the fist goes down as
uh you can't Lurch step so Lurch step to

350
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:16,079
uh you can't Lurch step so Lurch step to
 

351
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,310
uh you can't Lurch step so Lurch step to
me is when you take your line of gravity

352
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
me is when you take your line of gravity
 

353
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,870
me is when you take your line of gravity
and you're moving it between your

354
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,880

 

355
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,150

feet so if he's not there take no you're

356
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
feet so if he's not there take no you're
 

357
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,870
feet so if he's not there take no you're
there but not pulling AER step looks

358
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
there but not pulling AER step looks
 

359
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,870
there but not pulling AER step looks
like

360
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:31,880
like
 

361
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,350
like
this and a lot of people do that because

362
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,360
this and a lot of people do that because
 

363
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,949
this and a lot of people do that because
they want the mer the gravitational

364
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
they want the mer the gravitational
 

365
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,910
they want the mer the gravitational

marriage on the
 

367
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,310
marriage on the
Strip but if I do

368
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,320
Strip but if I do
 

369
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,630
Strip but if I do
that when he goes he does this anchoring

370
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
that when he goes he does this anchoring
 

371
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,150
that when he goes he does this anchoring
elbow go and I try to do that you get

372
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
elbow go and I try to do that you get
 

373
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,150
elbow go and I try to do that you get
checked out okay you have to work the

374
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,160
checked out okay you have to work the
 

375
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,790
checked out okay you have to work the
energy so the fist go is going down

376
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
energy so the fist go is going down
 

377
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,350
energy so the fist go is going down
right away and that's where you have to

378
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
right away and that's where you have to
 

379
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,030
right away and that's where you have to
drop

380
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,040
drop
 

381
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,430
drop
so side note cuz we had a lot of

382
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,440
so side note cuz we had a lot of
 

383
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,430
so side note cuz we had a lot of
problems working that everyone was lurge

384
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:04,440
problems working that everyone was lurge
 

385

00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
not down on a ler step okay and then
 

395
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,150
not down on a ler step okay and then
secondarily once you touch something I

not just popping him in the head okay
 

405
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,629
not just popping him in the head okay
but we're going to do that part

406
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:36,639
but we're going to do that part
 

407
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,790

Center so I'm not here go and I'm
 

415
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,030
Center so I'm not here go and I'm
hitting here let

416
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
hitting here let
 

417
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:08,430
hitting here let
touch in his Center

418
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:08,440

 

419
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,269

okay let try that all right so that that

420
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
okay let try that all right so that that
 

421
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,550
okay let try that all right so that that
would be my take on the problems as they

422
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
would be my take on the problems as they
 

423
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,069
would be my take on the problems as they
were set up in the first video

424
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
were set up in the first video
 

425
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,949
were set up in the first video
okay and then prayer request is how to

426
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
okay and then prayer request is how to
 

427
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,389
okay and then prayer request is how to
do how to get to Niko okay so a couple

428
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:25,399
do how to get to Niko okay so a couple
 

429
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,150
do how to get to Niko okay so a couple
things that we have always said the

430
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
things that we have always said the
 

431
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,389
things that we have always said the
fight must spiral rotate okay and so the

432
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
fight must spiral rotate okay and so the
 

433
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,150
fight must spiral rotate okay and so the
spiral rotation is I got to get off of

434
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,160
spiral rotation is I got to get off of
 

435
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,350
spiral rotation is I got to get off of
this 180

436
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
this 180
 

437
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,910
this 180
okay um and he has to end up at a

438
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
okay um and he has to end up at a
 

439
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,629
okay um and he has to end up at a
minimum over here at the

440
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:45,639
minimum over here at the
 

441
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,910
minimum over here at the
4:00 preferably the 3:00 okay we got to

442
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:50,920
4:00 preferably the 3:00 okay we got to
 

443
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,310
4:00 preferably the 3:00 okay we got to
start spiral

444
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
start spiral
 

445
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,710
start spiral
rotating so what ends up happening as I

446
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:55,720
rotating so what ends up happening as I
 

447
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,069
rotating so what ends up happening as I
would diagnose reverse engineer this

448
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
would diagnose reverse engineer this
 

449
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,230
would diagnose reverse engineer this
technique is is I came in okay but he's

450
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
technique is is I came in okay but he's
 

451
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,470
technique is is I came in okay but he's
really strong so that I will not get

452
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
really strong so that I will not get
 

453
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,470
really strong so that I will not get
that other technique

454
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
that other technique
 

455
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,629
that other technique
okay we're going to go slow so I can

456
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
okay we're going to go slow so I can
 

457
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,790
okay we're going to go slow so I can
talk okay so he's pulling in I'm trying

458
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:13,800
talk okay so he's pulling in I'm trying
 

459
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,949
talk okay so he's pulling in I'm trying
the other technique I feel the strength

460
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:15,959
the other technique I feel the strength
 

461
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,990
the other technique I feel the strength
I let it PA and then I keep him moving

462
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
I let it PA and then I keep him moving
 

463
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,750
I let it PA and then I keep him moving
in the

464
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760

 

465
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,350

circle so again nice and slow boom he's

466
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:28,360
circle so again nice and slow boom he's
 

467
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,310
circle so again nice and slow boom he's
strong enough let it pass here's the

468
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
strong enough let it pass here's the
 

469
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,550
strong enough let it pass here's the
other hand the other hand passes takes

470
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:33,560
other hand the other hand passes takes
 

471
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,310
other hand the other hand passes takes
them into that

472
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
them into that
 

473
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,320

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,030
the other hand is there that's why the
other hand as it yields the other hand

488
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,040
other hand as it yields the other hand
 

489
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,629
other hand as it yields the other hand
picks it up and this one now is on the

490
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
picks it up and this one now is on the
 

491
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,230
picks it up and this one now is on the
on this guard here okay so as we're here

492
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
on this guard here okay so as we're here
 

493
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:33,230
on this guard here okay so as we're here
it comes around here

494
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240

 

495
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,829

okay let's try so again I'm learning how

496
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
okay let's try so again I'm learning how
 

497
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,069
okay let's try so again I'm learning how
to think all that I have done at this

498
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
to think all that I have done at this
 

499
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,189
to think all that I have done at this
point was use Yong theory that is all

500
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
point was use Yong theory that is all
 

501
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,189
point was use Yong theory that is all
I've done okay and this what is the

502
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:44,199
I've done okay and this what is the
 

503
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,189
I've done okay and this what is the
actual biome mechanical

504
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:46,199
actual biome mechanical
 

505
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,430
actual biome mechanical
soundness that would get me in this

506
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:48,440
soundness that would get me in this
 

507
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,710
soundness that would get me in this
situation okay so for example he has to

508
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:51,720
situation okay so for example he has to
 

509
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,389
situation okay so for example he has to
be pulling otherwise I wouldn't be

510
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:53,399
be pulling otherwise I wouldn't be
 

511
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,990
be pulling otherwise I wouldn't be
entering and then martially go ahead

512
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
entering and then martially go ahead
 

513
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,389
entering and then martially go ahead
double check it yeah if he's not pulling

514
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
double check it yeah if he's not pulling
 

515
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,150
double check it yeah if he's not pulling
me I couldn't anyways

516
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,160
me I couldn't anyways
 

517
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,069
me I couldn't anyways
okay uh another thing you can use to

518
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
okay uh another thing you can use to
 

519
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,350
okay uh another thing you can use to
validate your thinking because the art

520
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,360
validate your thinking because the art
 

521
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,230
validate your thinking because the art
is concentric if you get onto the right

522
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,240
is concentric if you get onto the right
 

523
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,470
is concentric if you get onto the right
track it is a track that you've already

524
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,480
track it is a track that you've already
 

525
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,670
track it is a track that you've already
been on multiple times okay so if you

526
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:14,680
been on multiple times okay so if you
 

527
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,310
been on multiple times okay so if you
pay attention if he did for example

528
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,320
pay attention if he did for example
 

529
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,430
pay attention if he did for example
Yoki and we came

530
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,440
Yoki and we came
 

531
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,350
Yoki and we came
here you're going to see that that is

532
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
here you're going to see that that is
 

533
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,749
here you're going to see that that is
what's happening here okay so we'll go

534
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:28,759
what's happening here okay so we'll go
 

535
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,629
what's happening here okay so we'll go
slow so I can talk we all know why this

536
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:31,639
slow so I can talk we all know why this
 

537
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,829
slow so I can talk we all know why this
first part is happening w't feel that

538
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:34,839
first part is happening w't feel that
 

539
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,150
first part is happening w't feel that
and right here is the strip we come back

540
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
and right here is the strip we come back
 

541
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,870
and right here is the strip we come back
all the time and

542
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:39,880
all the time and
 

543
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,110
all the time and
you

544
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120

 

545
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,150

okay going

546
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
okay going
 

547
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,030
okay going
in it's right there all I'm doing is not

548
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
in it's right there all I'm doing is not
 

549
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,110
in it's right there all I'm doing is not
taking the strike to emphasize the arm

550
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
taking the strike to emphasize the arm
 

551
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,629
taking the strike to emphasize the arm
check but it's there if you wanted it

552
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:57,639
check but it's there if you wanted it
 

553
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,470
check but it's there if you wanted it
okay

554
00:14:59,470 --> 00:14:59,480
okay
 

555
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,269
okay
okay to show you how the where the Yoko

556
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
okay to show you how the where the Yoko
 

557
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,350
okay to show you how the where the Yoko
manucci is we pull him in feel the

558
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
manucci is we pull him in feel the
 

559
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,590
manucci is we pull him in feel the
pressure it's right there

560
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:08,600
pressure it's right there
 

561
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,950
pressure it's right there
boom one more

562
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:15,960

 

563
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,829

time okay so we used yinong Theory to

566
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
time okay so we used yinong Theory to
 

567
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,269
time okay so we used yinong Theory to
get us into the ballpark we confirmed

568
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
get us into the ballpark we confirmed
 

569
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,910
get us into the ballpark we confirmed
martially what is actually people do

570
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
martially what is actually people do
 

571
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,150
martially what is actually people do
what's actually going to happen happen

572
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
what's actually going to happen happen
 

573
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,350
what's actually going to happen happen
and then now we use a concentric uh

574
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
and then now we use a concentric uh
 

575
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,150
and then now we use a concentric uh
manifestation yep seen that before it's

576
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
manifestation yep seen that before it's
 

577
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,590
manifestation yep seen that before it's
true cuz this is a concentric epist

578
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:38,600
true cuz this is a concentric epist
 

579
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,030
true cuz this is a concentric epist
epistemology at work here uh and now uh

580
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
epistemology at work here uh and now uh
 

581
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,829
epistemology at work here uh and now uh
what we have and we also rotate the

582
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
what we have and we also rotate the
 

583
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,670
what we have and we also rotate the
fight you always have to rotate the

584
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
fight you always have to rotate the
 

585
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,790
fight you always have to rotate the
fight it's part of the Arts principle so

586
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
fight it's part of the Arts principle so
 

587
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,389
fight it's part of the Arts principle so
we rotated the fight you can see that UK

588
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
we rotated the fight you can see that UK
 

589
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,110
we rotated the fight you can see that UK
going off the

590
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,120
going off the
 

591
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,030
going off the
180 and doing those what is it 245°

592
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
180 and doing those what is it 245°
 

593
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,509
180 and doing those what is it 245°
I don't know what is it andw to 3/4 is

594
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
I don't know what is it andw to 3/4 is
 

595
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,710
I don't know what is it andw to 3/4 is
270 270 we hit the 270 which we always

596
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
270 270 we hit the 270 which we always
 

597
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,110
270 270 we hit the 270 which we always
have to hit Okay so we're we're in the

598
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
have to hit Okay so we're we're in the
 

599
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,189
have to hit Okay so we're we're in the
ballpark everything's consistent and

600
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
ballpark everything's consistent and
 

601
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,670
ballpark everything's consistent and
valid um now we want to hit the Niko

602
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
valid um now we want to hit the Niko
 

603
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,509
valid um now we want to hit the Niko
okay and the Niko like all locks on the

604
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:18,519
okay and the Niko like all locks on the
 

605
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,910
okay and the Niko like all locks on the
extremities require that the arm get

606
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
extremities require that the arm get
 

607
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,189
extremities require that the arm get
isolated and what that means is that it

608
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:24,199
isolated and what that means is that it
 

609
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,710
isolated and what that means is that it
requires that his elbow is not near his

610
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
requires that his elbow is not near his
 

611
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,350
requires that his elbow is not near his
torso okay otherwise you can't do this

612
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
torso okay otherwise you can't do this
 

613
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,829
torso okay otherwise you can't do this
kind of stuff um so that is why what I

614
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:32,839
kind of stuff um so that is why what I
 

615
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,870
kind of stuff um so that is why what I
mean by that is he pulls in and I'm here

616
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
mean by that is he pulls in and I'm here
 

617
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,829
mean by that is he pulls in and I'm here
you can't you're not going to get any F

618
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:38,839
you can't you're not going to get any F
 

619
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,269
you can't you're not going to get any F
here okay you have to get separation

620
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:42,279
here okay you have to get separation
 

621
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,790
here okay you have to get separation
between the elbow and the Torso now the

622
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:45,800
between the elbow and the Torso now the
 

623
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,870
between the elbow and the Torso now the
arm is isolated now the elbow's

624
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:47,880
arm is isolated now the elbow's
 

625
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,430
arm is isolated now the elbow's
vulnerable and now the wrist is

626
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
vulnerable and now the wrist is
 

627
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,269
vulnerable and now the wrist is
vulnerable otherwise it's not okay so if

628
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
vulnerable otherwise it's not okay so if
 

629
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,749
vulnerable otherwise it's not okay so if
you pay attention in everything that

630
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
you pay attention in everything that
 

631
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,629
you pay attention in everything that
we've done up till now the arm is

632
00:16:59,629 --> 00:16:59,639
we've done up till now the arm is
 

633
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,509
we've done up till now the arm is
getting longer is what I'm doing okay

634
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
getting longer is what I'm doing okay
 

635
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,669
getting longer is what I'm doing okay
because the centrifugal energy is

636
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:06,679
because the centrifugal energy is
 

637
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,829
because the centrifugal energy is
extending him out from me this way okay

638
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
extending him out from me this way okay
 

639
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,230
extending him out from me this way okay
does that make sense okay so now I got

640
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,240
does that make sense okay so now I got
 

641
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,270
does that make sense okay so now I got
to figure

642
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,280
to figure
 

643
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,789
to figure
out

644
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:17,799
out
 

645
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,710
out
how to get to the N over here all right

646
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
how to get to the N over here all right
 

647
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,429
how to get to the N over here all right
so in in light of everything that I've

648
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
so in in light of everything that I've
 

649
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,070
so in in light of everything that I've
done so probably back to Y

650
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,080
done so probably back to Y
 

651
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,750
done so probably back to Y
Theory so here goes I'm coming around

652
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
Theory so here goes I'm coming around
 

653
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,870
Theory so here goes I'm coming around
right and that is going to be pulling

654
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
right and that is going to be pulling
 

655
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,110
right and that is going to be pulling
against the centrifugal energy that I

656
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
against the centrifugal energy that I
 

657
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,630
against the centrifugal energy that I
used

658
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:43,640
used
 

659
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,270
used
okay so usually what tends to happen is

660
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,280
okay so usually what tends to happen is
 

661
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,630
okay so usually what tends to happen is
I got to figure out how to

662
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
I got to figure out how to
 

663
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,230
I got to figure out how to
move where that's not going to be okay

664
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
move where that's not going to be okay
 

665
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,390
move where that's not going to be okay
where that pull is not going to be so

666
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
where that pull is not going to be so
 

667
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,750
where that pull is not going to be so
let me

668
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
let me
 

669
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,909
let me
expl if C tripical

670
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:02,919
expl if C tripical
 

671
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,310
expl if C tripical
energy is pulling them

672
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,320
energy is pulling them
 

673
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,350
energy is pulling them
out it's like any other force and the

674
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,360
out it's like any other force and the
 

675
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,350
out it's like any other force and the
non-c contesting line is at the 90° to

676
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,360
non-c contesting line is at the 90° to
 

677
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,789
non-c contesting line is at the 90° to
it okay and that's what I ended up using

678
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
it okay and that's what I ended up using
 

679
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,350
it okay and that's what I ended up using
so he's coming around if I go this way

680
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
so he's coming around if I go this way
 

681
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,470
so he's coming around if I go this way
you'll feel the pull I got to hit the

682
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
you'll feel the pull I got to hit the
 

683
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,510
you'll feel the pull I got to hit the
90° to the centrifugal force line

684
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
90° to the centrifugal force line
 

685
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,230
90° to the centrifugal force line
so be and then there's nothing then you

686
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
so be and then there's nothing then you
 

687
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,990
so be and then there's nothing then you
have okay 's try it on the other

688
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000

 

689
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,070

side I did all this for a reason stated

690
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,080
side I did all this for a reason stated
 

691
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,710
side I did all this for a reason stated
I extend the arm I take to

692
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720

 

693
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,430

90° okay let's just get there and see

694
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,440
90° okay let's just get there and see
 

695
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,029
90° okay let's just get there and see
what happens try it all right I'm going

696
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
what happens try it all right I'm going
 

697
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,909
what happens try it all right I'm going
to show it again CU it's a little weird

698
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:52,919
to show it again CU it's a little weird
 

699
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,990
to show it again CU it's a little weird
here okay so go really slow so I can

700
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,000
here okay so go really slow so I can
 

701
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,789
here okay so go really slow so I can
talk he's going in boom I feel her

702
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
talk he's going in boom I feel her
 

703
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,990
talk he's going in boom I feel her
streng so I yield to the strength so you

704
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
streng so I yield to the strength so you
 

705
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,029
streng so I yield to the strength so you
got to give some

706
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:04,039
got to give some
 

707
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,669
got to give some
energy okay she didn't let go that's the

708
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
energy okay she didn't let go that's the
 

709
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,149
energy okay she didn't let go that's the
first thing to know if she let go she'd

710
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:11,159
first thing to know if she let go she'd
 

711
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,270
first thing to know if she let go she'd
go she let go she'd come around and

712
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
go she let go she'd come around and
 

713
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,149
go she let go she'd come around and
you'd have sh Naga and all that kind of

714
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:15,159
you'd have sh Naga and all that kind of
 

715
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,630
you'd have sh Naga and all that kind of
stuff so this is a

716
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:17,640
stuff so this is a
 

717
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,870
stuff so this is a
technique that's kind of answering the

718
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
technique that's kind of answering the
 

719
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,350
technique that's kind of answering the
what if what if they didn't let go okay

720
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,360
what if what if they didn't let go okay
 

721
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,149
what if what if they didn't let go okay
if they didn't let go this interical

722
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:25,159
if they didn't let go this interical
 

723
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,830
if they didn't let go this interical
force would isolate the arm by having

724
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
force would isolate the arm by having
 

725
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,430
force would isolate the arm by having
the body and the elbow elbows separate

726
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
the body and the elbow elbows separate
 

727
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,350
the body and the elbow elbows separate
from each other okay so

728
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,360
from each other okay so
 

729
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,270
from each other okay so
one and there it

730
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,280
one and there it
 

731
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,830
one and there it
is there it is okay and now I can't go

732
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:40,840
is there it is okay and now I can't go
 

733
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,950
is there it is okay and now I can't go
here so this pull line I go

734
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:45,960
here so this pull line I go
 

735
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,510
here so this pull line I go
here okay and that's where I

736
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,520
here okay and that's where I
 

737
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,470
here okay and that's where I
find the

738
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:53,480
find the
 

739
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,230
find the
Nik

740
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240

 

741
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,710

here do it again

742
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:01,720

 

743
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,789

and and

744
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
and and
 

745
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:13,669
and and
boom boom here find it

746
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679

 

747
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,310

here if you want

748
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
here if you want
 

749
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,710
here if you want
to change the foot you could but it's

750
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:19,720
to change the foot you could but it's
 

751
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:28,990
to change the foot you could but it's
still at that point Bo here

752
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,000

 

753
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,990

I had no project here did you see so

754
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
I had no project here did you see so
 

755
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,870
I had no project here did you see so
you're going

756
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
you're going
 

757
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,430
you're going
to uh

758
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
to uh
 

759
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,950
to uh
pull then you're pushing there with your

760
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
pull then you're pushing there with your
 

761
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,430
pull then you're pushing there with your
body enough that I would do that okay

762
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:44,440
body enough that I would do that okay
 

763
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,230
body enough that I would do that okay
yes and if you paid attention your arm

764
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
yes and if you paid attention your arm
 

765
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,830
yes and if you paid attention your arm
extended last time I had to push project

766
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
extended last time I had to push project
 

767
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,549
extended last time I had to push project
you on there okay so we can go slow and

768
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
you on there okay so we can go slow and
 

769
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,190
you on there okay so we can go slow and
you can feel those

770
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,200
you can feel those
 

771
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,590
you can feel those
forces a one we push in off there you go

772
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:58,600
forces a one we push in off there you go
 

773
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,110
forces a one we push in off there you go
there's the arm extension

774
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120

 

775
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,470

okay so again

776
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:05,480
okay so again
 

777
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,149
okay so again
one one here I

778
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:13,159

 

779
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,149

go go

780
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159

 

781
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,789

slower slower so you don't go so

782
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:21,799
slower slower so you don't go so
 

783
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,390
slower slower so you don't go so
fast like there's still energy there it

784
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,400
fast like there's still energy there it
 

785
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,950
fast like there's still energy there it
is here I go

786
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:31,960

 

787
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,029

One More

788
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:36,039

 

789
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,029

Time Boom

790
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
Time Boom
 

791
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,590
Time Boom
through boom here that time you did not

792
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
through boom here that time you did not
 

793
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,950
through boom here that time you did not
get all right try okay and so now I have

794
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:47,960
get all right try okay and so now I have
 

795
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,390
get all right try okay and so now I have
my non-c contestation theory that you

796
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
my non-c contestation theory that you
 

797
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,110
my non-c contestation theory that you
always use it's 90° to the inertial

798
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
always use it's 90° to the inertial
 

799
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,510
always use it's 90° to the inertial
pathway and we're doing that again I

800
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
pathway and we're doing that again I
 

801
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,110
pathway and we're doing that again I
have my arm isolation uh principles that

802
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,120
have my arm isolation uh principles that
 

803
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,470
have my arm isolation uh principles that
you always have to use uh and now you

804
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
you always have to use uh and now you
 

805
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,870
you always have to use uh and now you
can also see oh I have another

806
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
can also see oh I have another
 

807
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,310
can also see oh I have another
concentricity so if we're doing just

808
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,320
concentricity so if we're doing just
 

809
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,710
concentricity so if we're doing just
straight

810
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
straight
 

811
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,990
straight
kadori um eel is the same thing his arm

812
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,000
kadori um eel is the same thing his arm
 

813
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,830
kadori um eel is the same thing his arm
was here I move out to the side with

814
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
was here I move out to the side with
 

815
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,149
was here I move out to the side with
that same foot workk and then you attack

816
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
that same foot workk and then you attack
 

817
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,430
that same foot workk and then you attack
the wrist there okay uh all in that

818
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
the wrist there okay uh all in that
 

819
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,230
the wrist there okay uh all in that
technique the arm is already isolated

820
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
technique the arm is already isolated
 

821
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,149
technique the arm is already isolated
when you when you did that technique

822
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
when you when you did that technique
 

823
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,830
when you when you did that technique
okay so if you pay attention that's all

824
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
okay so if you pay attention that's all
 

825
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,029
okay so if you pay attention that's all
that's happening here but the energy is

826
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,039
that's happening here but the energy is
 

827
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,230
that's happening here but the energy is
right there that I am using okay but the

828
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,240
right there that I am using okay but the
 

829
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,909
right there that I am using okay but the
footwork is the same there's something

830
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
footwork is the same there's something
 

831
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,350
footwork is the same there's something
that's different

832
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
that's different
 

833
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,310
that's different
though and that is that because of the

834
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
though and that is that because of the
 

835
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,430
though and that is that because of the
energy that's happening you this doesn't

836
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:48,440
energy that's happening you this doesn't
 

837
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,990
energy that's happening you this doesn't
work so good so if you pay attention I

838
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
work so good so if you pay attention I
 

839
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,789
work so good so if you pay attention I
take a two on one and I turn I turn I

840
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
take a two on one and I turn I turn I
 

841
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,230
take a two on one and I turn I turn I
turn that okay so watch this is very

842
00:22:59,230 --> 00:22:59,240
turn that okay so watch this is very
 

843
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,269
turn that okay so watch this is very
common in in fighting like we're here

844
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:01,279
common in in fighting like we're here
 

845
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,630
common in in fighting like we're here
like that you you never go like that

846
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:03,640
like that you you never go like that
 

847
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,070
like that you you never go like that
because he's going to open up the E

848
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
because he's going to open up the E
 

849
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,310
because he's going to open up the E
right there okay so someone's grabbing

850
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
right there okay so someone's grabbing
 

851
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,430
right there okay so someone's grabbing
you you're always here like this here on

852
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
you you're always here like this here on
 

853
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,750
you you're always here like this here on
top and you're turning that thing around

854
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
top and you're turning that thing around
 

855
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,950
top and you're turning that thing around
okay so very similarly done here so pay

856
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960
okay so very similarly done here so pay
 

857
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,750
okay so very similarly done here so pay
attention on

858
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:20,760

 

859
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,149

this boom to turn it into place okay

860
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
this boom to turn it into place okay
 

861
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,070
this boom to turn it into place okay
once it's in place then you take and

862
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,080
once it's in place then you take and
 

863
00:23:29,080 --> 00:24:02,110
once it's in place then you take and
you're in just standard me

864
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,120

 

865
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:57,310

okay let's try

866
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,320

 

867
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,669

this came up uh again when I do my Keon

868
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:00,679
this came up uh again when I do my Keon
 

869
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,510
this came up uh again when I do my Keon
waza if you pay attention I use my body

870
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:04,520
waza if you pay attention I use my body
 

871
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,110
waza if you pay attention I use my body
and what I mean by that is the rotation

872
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
and what I mean by that is the rotation
 

873
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,830
and what I mean by that is the rotation
of my body of the pattern that my body

874
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
of my body of the pattern that my body
 

875
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,549
of my body of the pattern that my body
is taking in space to do much of the

876
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
is taking in space to do much of the
 

877
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,950
is taking in space to do much of the
wrist turning um in for something like

878
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:15,960
wrist turning um in for something like
 

879
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,149
wrist turning um in for something like
Niko or sonio or something like that

880
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
Niko or sonio or something like that
 

881
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,470
Niko or sonio or something like that
okay uh so because the reason for this

882
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:21,480
okay uh so because the reason for this
 

883
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,830
okay uh so because the reason for this
is grab okay and don't let me turn your

884
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:24,840
is grab okay and don't let me turn your
 

885
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,510
is grab okay and don't let me turn your
wrist I'll break it if you let

886
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,520
wrist I'll break it if you let
 

887
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,590
wrist I'll break it if you let
me turn it

888
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:28,600
me turn it
 

889
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,510
me turn it
there's no way just it's impossible you

890
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
there's no way just it's impossible you
 

891
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,990
there's no way just it's impossible you
cannot do that okay so what we're doing

892
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,000
cannot do that okay so what we're doing
 

893
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,470
cannot do that okay so what we're doing
here is I have a two onone now you see

894
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:39,480
here is I have a two onone now you see
 

895
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,909
here is I have a two onone now you see
and I get maybe

896
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
and I get maybe
 

897
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,310
and I get maybe
there that's about where it stops do you

898
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
there that's about where it stops do you
 

899
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,590
there that's about where it stops do you
see but now here's where my body

900
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:46,600
see but now here's where my body
 

901
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,950
see but now here's where my body
turns and you pay attention the Nel's on

902
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
turns and you pay attention the Nel's on
 

903
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,750
turns and you pay attention the Nel's on
get to turn it's right

904
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:52,760
get to turn it's right
 

905
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,430
get to turn it's right
there

906
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:54,440
there
 

907
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,630
there
okay so don't expect

908
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
okay so don't expect
 

909
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,830
okay so don't expect
as you're doing this technique you're

910
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:00,840
as you're doing this technique you're
 

911
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,950
as you're doing this technique you're
grabbing here and he's got this

912
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
grabbing here and he's got this
 

913
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,149
grabbing here and he's got this
centrifical energy you see don't

914
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:07,159
centrifical energy you see don't
 

915
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,070
centrifical energy you see don't
expect this to

916
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,080
expect this to
 

917
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,990
expect this to
get this all the way to

918
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,000
get this all the way to
 

919
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,029
get this all the way to
there you're just here you get that turn

920
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,039
there you're just here you get that turn
 

921
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,669
there you're just here you get that turn
and then you turn this right there okay

922
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
and then you turn this right there okay
 

923
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,830
and then you turn this right there okay
and now you have

924
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
and now you have
 

925
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,389
and now you have
it don't get over anxious on that okay

926
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:30,399
it don't get over anxious on that okay
 

927
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,070
it don't get over anxious on that okay
what'll happen is in the fight you took

928
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,080
what'll happen is in the fight you took
 

929
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,510
what'll happen is in the fight you took
too long you stayed in place the SP

930
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:36,520
too long you stayed in place the SP
 

931
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,310
too long you stayed in place the SP
rotation is coming to a stop and the guy

932
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,320
rotation is coming to a stop and the guy
 

933
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,310
rotation is coming to a stop and the guy
counters you you're never strong enough

934
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,320
counters you you're never strong enough
 

935
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,750
counters you you're never strong enough
okay what we're doing instead I get

936
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
okay what we're doing instead I get
 

937
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,830
okay what we're doing instead I get
enough angle I move to keep the spiral

938
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:46,840
enough angle I move to keep the spiral
 

939
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,549
enough angle I move to keep the spiral
rotation going and then I end up having

940
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:49,559
rotation going and then I end up having
 

941
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,269
rotation going and then I end up having
the lock if I don't have the lock I'm

942
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:52,279
the lock if I don't have the lock I'm
 

943
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,590
the lock if I don't have the lock I'm
still in the zone of sanctuary do you

944
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:54,600
still in the zone of sanctuary do you
 

945
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,950
still in the zone of sanctuary do you
see and the guy let go probably and I'm

946
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:57,960
see and the guy let go probably and I'm
 

947
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,870
see and the guy let go probably and I'm
going

948
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
going
 

949
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,830
going
he let go of me which was the problem

950
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:00,840
he let go of me which was the problem
 

951
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,720
he let go of me which was the problem
okay you go on to something else okay
