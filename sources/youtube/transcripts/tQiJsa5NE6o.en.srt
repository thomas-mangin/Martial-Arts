1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,510

all right uh we'll be working from m i

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
all right uh we'll be working from m i
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,869
all right uh we'll be working from m i
want you to understand the strategy

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
want you to understand the strategy
 

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,910
want you to understand the strategy
okay I have weapons on so I'm trying to

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920
okay I have weapons on so I'm trying to
 

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,910
okay I have weapons on so I'm trying to
isolate arms so I can create angles of

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
isolate arms so I can create angles of
 

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,150
isolate arms so I can create angles of
attack so I can't draw my weapons cuz he

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,160
attack so I can't draw my weapons cuz he
 

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,070
attack so I can't draw my weapons cuz he
can start defending it but if I if I can

12
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
can start defending it but if I if I can
 

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,710
can start defending it but if I if I can
isolate an arm then I have this whole

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:25,720
isolate an arm then I have this whole
 

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,710
isolate an arm then I have this whole
angle of attack that I C I created a

16
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:27,720
angle of attack that I C I created a
 

17
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,830
angle of attack that I C I created a
zone of sanctuary for my weapon okay so

18
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,840
zone of sanctuary for my weapon okay so
 

19
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,830
zone of sanctuary for my weapon okay so
we want to look for these arm

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
we want to look for these arm
 

21
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,389
we want to look for these arm
isolations I want you to think

22
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
isolations I want you to think
 

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,270
isolations I want you to think
differently uh when someone is trying to

24
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
differently uh when someone is trying to
 

25
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,709
differently uh when someone is trying to
get you off of them with various arm

26
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:41,719
get you off of them with various arm
 

27
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,510
get you off of them with various arm
pushes okay so for example he pushes up

28
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
pushes okay so for example he pushes up
 

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,869
pushes okay so for example he pushes up
on the chest I want you to understand

30
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
on the chest I want you to understand
 

31
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,630
on the chest I want you to understand
that he moved his elbow away from his

32
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:51,640
that he moved his elbow away from his
 

33
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,470
that he moved his elbow away from his
torso and that is the beginning of

34
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
torso and that is the beginning of
 

35
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,270
torso and that is the beginning of
isolating that arm it's the same in your

36
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
isolating that arm it's the same in your
 

37
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,869
isolating that arm it's the same in your
Tachi waza you're you're keihan is

38
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
Tachi waza you're you're keihan is
 

39
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,310
Tachi waza you're you're keihan is
building built that in already the elbow

40
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,320
building built that in already the elbow
 

41
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,469
building built that in already the elbow
is away from the Torso that's what

42
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:05,479
is away from the Torso that's what
 

43
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,310
is away from the Torso that's what
isolates the arm hence all your pins and

44
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
isolates the arm hence all your pins and
 

45
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,109
isolates the arm hence all your pins and
stuff off of the arm okay or he pushes

46
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
stuff off of the arm okay or he pushes
 

47
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,030
stuff off of the arm okay or he pushes
my

48
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
my
 

49
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,910
my
knee same thing the elbow has moved away

50
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
knee same thing the elbow has moved away
 

51
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,310
knee same thing the elbow has moved away
from the Torso and that is the exposure

52
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
from the Torso and that is the exposure
 

53
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,109
from the Torso and that is the exposure
I want to begin isolating that arm okay

54
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
I want to begin isolating that arm okay
 

55
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,109
I want to begin isolating that arm okay
as opposed to in my mind he's pushing my

56
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
as opposed to in my mind he's pushing my
 

57
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,109
as opposed to in my mind he's pushing my
knee and I pop it off and I go back down

58
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,119
knee and I pop it off and I go back down
 

59
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,630
knee and I pop it off and I go back down
okay when to change our

60
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
okay when to change our
 

61
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,389
okay when to change our
mind um so let's say he's uh some of

62
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:38,399
mind um so let's say he's uh some of
 

63
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,190
mind um so let's say he's uh some of
some of your bigger guys are trying the

64
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
some of your bigger guys are trying the
 

65
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,350
some of your bigger guys are trying the
hip pushes where you push the guy off at

66
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
hip pushes where you push the guy off at
 

67
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,109
hip pushes where you push the guy off at
the hips so hey you're trying these

68
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:46,119
the hips so hey you're trying these
 

69
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,109
the hips so hey you're trying these
things all right but again if you look

70
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
things all right but again if you look
 

71
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,429
things all right but again if you look
when he goes to push his arm is isolated

72
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:52,439
when he goes to push his arm is isolated
 

73
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,870
when he goes to push his arm is isolated
do you see his elbows away from his

74
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,880
do you see his elbows away from his
 

75
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,950
do you see his elbows away from his
torso all right so to first introduce

76
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
torso all right so to first introduce
 

77
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,270
torso all right so to first introduce
the concept of what we're going to do is

78
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
the concept of what we're going to do is
 

79
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,070
the concept of what we're going to do is
one usually a guy reveals what he wants

80
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
one usually a guy reveals what he wants
 

81
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,630
one usually a guy reveals what he wants
and where you feel the pressure okay

82
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
and where you feel the pressure okay
 

83
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,710
and where you feel the pressure okay
sometimes if you're skilled enough you

84
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:13,720
sometimes if you're skilled enough you
 

85
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,110
sometimes if you're skilled enough you
read it right away but other times you

86
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,120
read it right away but other times you
 

87
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,589
read it right away but other times you
might have to wait until he tries

88
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
might have to wait until he tries
 

89
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,270
might have to wait until he tries
something and then you set him up to try

90
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
something and then you set him up to try
 

91
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,790
something and then you set him up to try
it again so let's say he's pushing on my

92
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
it again so let's say he's pushing on my
 

93
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,309
it again so let's say he's pushing on my
knee okay and I know I pop it and then I

94
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
knee okay and I know I pop it and then I
 

95
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,390
knee okay and I know I pop it and then I
let him do that again and now I'm

96
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
let him do that again and now I'm
 

97
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,390
let him do that again and now I'm
looking for it okay and then I've

98
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
looking for it okay and then I've
 

99
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,190
looking for it okay and then I've
isolated the arm got it yes sir okay or

100
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
isolated the arm got it yes sir okay or
 

101
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,430
isolated the arm got it yes sir okay or
you can feel what he's doing go we can

102
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
you can feel what he's doing go we can
 

103
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,589
you can feel what he's doing go we can
feel it and then you'll get it

104
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
feel it and then you'll get it
 

105
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,270
feel it and then you'll get it
okay so we know when we're doing we know

106
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
okay so we know when we're doing we know
 

107
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,710
okay so we know when we're doing we know
why we're doing now how do I do it so

108
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
why we're doing now how do I do it so
 

109
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,830
why we're doing now how do I do it so
you're going to Yin yield what he's

110
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:52,840
you're going to Yin yield what he's
 

111
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,229
you're going to Yin yield what he's
moving so you Yin yield

112
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
moving so you Yin yield
 

113
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,470
moving so you Yin yield
that and then that's going to make the

114
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
that and then that's going to make the
 

115
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,589
that and then that's going to make the
arm uh the elbow light so as you come

116
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
arm uh the elbow light so as you come
 

117
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,470
arm uh the elbow light so as you come
around you healed enough okay if you're

118
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,480
around you healed enough okay if you're
 

119
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,350
around you healed enough okay if you're
strong enough just pop it all the way

120
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
strong enough just pop it all the way
 

121
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,390
strong enough just pop it all the way
around if you're not strong enough you

122
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,400
around if you're not strong enough you
 

123
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,710
around if you're not strong enough you
can use the leverage generated by using

124
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
can use the leverage generated by using
 

125
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,309
can use the leverage generated by using
the fulcrum the mat as a fulcrum okay so

126
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
the fulcrum the mat as a fulcrum okay so
 

127
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,030
the fulcrum the mat as a fulcrum okay so
he's trying to tighten it back in and

128
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,040
he's trying to tighten it back in and
 

129
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,270
he's trying to tighten it back in and
bring it back in and I'll just keep

130
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
bring it back in and I'll just keep
 

131
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,470
bring it back in and I'll just keep
using the leverage of the mat to get it

132
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,480
using the leverage of the mat to get it
 

133
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,990
using the leverage of the mat to get it
over and we'll isolate it here here in

134
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,000
over and we'll isolate it here here in
 

135
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,149
over and we'll isolate it here here in
arm cross face and again I created that

136
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:35,159
arm cross face and again I created that
 

137
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,390
arm cross face and again I created that
angle of attack where I can draw my

138
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,400
angle of attack where I can draw my
 

139
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,589
angle of attack where I can draw my
weapons okay so that's the first one go

140
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
weapons okay so that's the first one go
 

141
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,869
weapons okay so that's the first one go
slow he goes I yield the knee just

142
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
slow he goes I yield the knee just
 

143
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,270
slow he goes I yield the knee just
enough underneath if I'm strong enough

144
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,280
enough underneath if I'm strong enough
 

145
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,710
enough underneath if I'm strong enough
I'll just pop it all the way around if

146
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
I'll just pop it all the way around if
 

147
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,630
I'll just pop it all the way around if
I'm not I start to use the mat to lever

148
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm not I start to use the mat to lever
 

149
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,869
I'm not I start to use the mat to lever
it around then I isolate it and I have

150
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879
it around then I isolate it and I have
 

151
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,270
it around then I isolate it and I have
this Zone here okay let's try that arm

152
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,280
this Zone here okay let's try that arm
 

153
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,270
this Zone here okay let's try that arm
isolation yes sir we

154
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
isolation yes sir we
 

155
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,509
isolation yes sir we
go so again you'll look for that and

156
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
go so again you'll look for that and
 

157
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,190
go so again you'll look for that and
your best angle of attack to generate is

158
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,200
your best angle of attack to generate is
 

159
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,670
your best angle of attack to generate is
to get an angle canellation on his arm

160
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
to get an angle canellation on his arm
 

161
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,590
to get an angle canellation on his arm
and remember that's going to be across

162
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
and remember that's going to be across
 

163
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,310
and remember that's going to be across
his body so just like standing it's

164
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
his body so just like standing it's
 

165
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,670
his body so just like standing it's
diagonally across his body this time is

166
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
diagonally across his body this time is
 

167
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,950
diagonally across his body this time is
this way across his body

168
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
this way across his body
 

169
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,710
this way across his body
