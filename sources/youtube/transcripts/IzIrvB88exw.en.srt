1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,910

so let's go

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:03,920
so let's go
 

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,629
so let's go
over how I understand the uh attack they

4
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
over how I understand the uh attack they
 

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,070
over how I understand the uh attack they
attack

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
attack
 

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,110
attack
okay um one as I said strategically is

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
okay um one as I said strategically is
 

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,630
okay um one as I said strategically is
teaching you rotation and counter

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:17,640
teaching you rotation and counter
 

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,269
teaching you rotation and counter
rotation okay and we've talked a lot

12
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:20,279
rotation okay and we've talked a lot
 

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,310
rotation okay and we've talked a lot
about that um but what's happening here

14
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,320
about that um but what's happening here
 

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,589
about that um but what's happening here
is some what if training which is why

16
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
is some what if training which is why
 

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,790
is some what if training which is why
I'm not really a fan of this okay which

18
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm not really a fan of this okay which
 

19
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,190
I'm not really a fan of this okay which
we we don't do this too often

20
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
we we don't do this too often
 

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,910
we we don't do this too often
um pretty much everything you do here is

22
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
um pretty much everything you do here is
 

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,549
um pretty much everything you do here is
uh Uchi Ken you're going to work with

24
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
uh Uchi Ken you're going to work with
 

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,229
uh Uchi Ken you're going to work with
Uchi Ken so a lot of stuff we just do

26
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:43,239
Uchi Ken so a lot of stuff we just do
 

27
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,869
Uchi Ken so a lot of stuff we just do
from katate or kadori and and just work

28
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
from katate or kadori and and just work
 

29
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,189
from katate or kadori and and just work
GUI K okay uh what do I mean by what if

30
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
GUI K okay uh what do I mean by what if
 

31
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,310
GUI K okay uh what do I mean by what if
is she's in

32
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,320
is she's in
 

33
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,590
is she's in
h and she is going to have her hand out

34
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:58,600
h and she is going to have her hand out
 

35
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,110
h and she is going to have her hand out
like katate okay

36
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
like katate okay
 

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,270
like katate okay
and I am going to

38
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:04,280
and I am going to
 

39
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,270
and I am going to
push from

40
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,280
push from
 

41
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,550
push from
here

42
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
here
 

43
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,590
here
into this position

44
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
into this position
 

45
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,190
into this position
here so already in normal

46
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
here so already in normal
 

47
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,789
here so already in normal
coor I would just spinally

48
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

 

49
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,390

displace but this one is going to check

50
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
displace but this one is going to check
 

51
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,590
displace but this one is going to check
and spinally

52
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:28,600
and spinally
 

53
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,030
and spinally
displace and so sometimes you can have

54
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
displace and so sometimes you can have
 

55
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,990
displace and so sometimes you can have
your hand up higher okay and uh I reach

56
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
your hand up higher okay and uh I reach
 

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,069
your hand up higher okay and uh I reach
and then what if he grabs checks and

58
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
and then what if he grabs checks and
 

59
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,069
and then what if he grabs checks and
finally displaced so the check here is

60
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,079
finally displaced so the check here is
 

61
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,510
finally displaced so the check here is
just pin against the body and you have

62
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
just pin against the body and you have
 

63
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,469
just pin against the body and you have
all your stripes

64
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:47,479
all your stripes
 

65
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:53,950
all your stripes
okay so that is what I'm

66
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:53,960

 

67
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,550

doing she's going to counter that with

68
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
doing she's going to counter that with
 

69
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,550
doing she's going to counter that with
the first move so what you go

70
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
the first move so what you go
 

71
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,029
the first move so what you go
yes and so I fall into empty space

72
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039

 

73
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,309

okay and if you watch and we'll use

74
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:09,319
okay and if you watch and we'll use
 

75
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,869
okay and if you watch and we'll use
different angles on the camera so we'll

76
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:11,879
different angles on the camera so we'll
 

77
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,229
different angles on the camera so we'll
show it from here first as I go boom she

78
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:17,239
show it from here first as I go boom she
 

79
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,869
show it from here first as I go boom she
is now at the flank to

80
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:19,879
is now at the flank to
 

81
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,430
is now at the flank to
me okay and so I have to UNF flank

82
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,440
me okay and so I have to UNF flank
 

83
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,869
me okay and so I have to UNF flank
myself and that's what this step is

84
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
myself and that's what this step is
 

85
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,070
myself and that's what this step is
doing

86
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
doing
 

87
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,190
doing
here we'll show it more time let's do it

88
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
here we'll show it more time let's do it
 

89
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,229
here we'll show it more time let's do it
from this Angle

90
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239

 

91
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,790

now so again what am I doing she'll let

92
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:39,800
now so again what am I doing she'll let
 

93
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,910
now so again what am I doing she'll let
me do it this time is I am checking in

94
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
me do it this time is I am checking in
 

95
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,790
me do it this time is I am checking in
spal this

96
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
spal this
 

97
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,350
spal this
place she counters that by

98
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
place she counters that by
 

99
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,710
place she counters that by
avoiding and now I'm being flanked so I

100
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
avoiding and now I'm being flanked so I
 

101
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,949
avoiding and now I'm being flanked so I
UNF flank Myself by coming to the back

102
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:57,959
UNF flank Myself by coming to the back
 

103
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,030
UNF flank Myself by coming to the back
of her body okay

104
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,040

 

105
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,030

and that is what's just happening more

106
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
and that is what's just happening more
 

107
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,430
and that is what's just happening more
smoothly as we go around okay once I'm

108
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
smoothly as we go around okay once I'm
 

109
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,430
smoothly as we go around okay once I'm
at the back of the

110
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
at the back of the
 

111
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,229
at the back of the
body I seek those training control

112
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,239
body I seek those training control
 

113
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,830
body I seek those training control
points of katate

114
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:18,840
points of katate
 

115
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,110
points of katate
okay and now I finally

116
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
okay and now I finally
 

117
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,949
okay and now I finally
displace from the rear

118
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959

 

119
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,309

so we'll do it

120
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:31,319
so we'll do it
 

121
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,670
so we'll do it
again boom unfl flank myself finally

122
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
again boom unfl flank myself finally
 

123
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,509
again boom unfl flank myself finally
displaced from the

124
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
displaced from the
 

125
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,070
displaced from the
rear of course you saw the throw though

126
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,080
rear of course you saw the throw though
 

127
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,149
rear of course you saw the throw though
okay so that is what's

128
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:43,159
okay so that is what's
 

129
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:56,350
okay so that is what's
happening boom boom

130
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:56,360

 

131
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,149

boom you think you got a good angle okay

132
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,159
boom you think you got a good angle okay
 

133
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,069
boom you think you got a good angle okay
okay so we go really slow so I can talk

134
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079
okay so we go really slow so I can talk
 

135
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,110
okay so we go really slow so I can talk
so

136
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
so
 

137
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,350
so
here I absorb let that void and I bit

138
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,360
here I absorb let that void and I bit
 

139
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,350
here I absorb let that void and I bit
her with what she wants

140
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
her with what she wants
 

141
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,030
her with what she wants
okay do that

142
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,040
okay do that
 

143
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,710
okay do that
again boom absorb so that does there's

144
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
again boom absorb so that does there's
 

145
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,830
again boom absorb so that does there's
no there's none of her Mass on that

146
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
no there's none of her Mass on that
 

147
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,670
no there's none of her Mass on that
right now for example if I was here she

148
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
right now for example if I was here she
 

149
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,110
right now for example if I was here she
can push me and I feel her mou so I take

150
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,120
can push me and I feel her mou so I take
 

151
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,350
can push me and I feel her mou so I take
that to zero pressure okay okay I don't

152
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
that to zero pressure okay okay I don't
 

153
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,510
that to zero pressure okay okay I don't
take it to POS negative like that I'm

154
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
take it to POS negative like that I'm
 

155
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,469
take it to POS negative like that I'm
not pulling

156
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:35,479
not pulling
 

157
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,749
not pulling
her hence I say I

158
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
her hence I say I
 

159
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:46,310
her hence I say I
avoid whom I bait her

160
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320

 

161
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,230

okay boom hands back

162
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,240

 

163
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,150

here I don't keep my hand here she's

164
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
here I don't keep my hand here she's
 

165
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,350
here I don't keep my hand here she's
never going to get it

166
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360

 

167
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,990

okay

168
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000

 

169
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,990

now I bait

170
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000

 

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,510

her boy

172

now again like I said there's a lot of

230
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:17,479
now again like I said there's a lot of
 

231
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,110
now again like I said there's a lot of
wh ifs that's happening here okay so if

232
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,120
wh ifs that's happening here okay so if
 

233
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,390
wh ifs that's happening here okay so if
you pay

234
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,400
you pay
 

235
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,589
you pay
attention is my back here right and if I

236
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
attention is my back here right and if I
 

237
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,510
attention is my back here right and if I
stay still she'd have my

238
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520
stay still she'd have my
 

239
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,950
stay still she'd have my
back and I'm going to keep her moving

240
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:31,960
back and I'm going to keep her moving
 

241
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,670
back and I'm going to keep her moving
she's not going to have that back you

242
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
she's not going to have that back you
 

243
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,230
she's not going to have that back you
see that now again when you fight you

244
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,240
see that now again when you fight you
 

245
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,550
see that now again when you fight you
realize that anyone that almost has your

246
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:39,560
realize that anyone that almost has your
 

247
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,270
realize that anyone that almost has your
back will keep trying to get your back

248
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
back will keep trying to get your back
 

249
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,309
back will keep trying to get your back
it happens all the time so it seems

250
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:43,319
it happens all the time so it seems
 

251
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,390
it happens all the time so it seems
crazy that someone would go around but

252
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
crazy that someone would go around but
 

253
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,869
crazy that someone would go around but
they do they do all the time okay

254
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
they do they do all the time okay
 

255
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,070
they do they do all the time okay
they're trying to get to the back I just

256
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,080
they're trying to get to the back I just
 

257
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,869
they're trying to get to the back I just
can't be too far ahead of them I just

258
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
can't be too far ahead of them I just
 

259

can't be too far ahead of them I just
got to be just

260
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
got to be just
 

261
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,710
got to be just
enough to give them the corner that they

262
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
enough to give them the corner that they
 

263
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,869
enough to give them the corner that they
think they can get around and get at the

264
00:07:59,869 --> 00:07:59,879
think they can get around and get at the
 

265
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,950
think they can get around and get at the
back okay so in other words this is too

266
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:03,960
back okay so in other words this is too
 

267
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,990
back okay so in other words this is too
far that becomes stupid okay but also

268
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
far that becomes stupid okay but also
 

269
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,430
far that becomes stupid okay but also
this is stupid too this isn't going to

270
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
this is stupid too this isn't going to
 

271
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,869
this is stupid too this isn't going to
work okay I'm just inside where I keep

272
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
work okay I'm just inside where I keep
 

273
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,270
work okay I'm just inside where I keep
egging her around that corner trying to

274
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
egging her around that corner trying to
 

275
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,230
egging her around that corner trying to
get it okay all right next let's pay

276
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
get it okay all right next let's pay
 

277
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,230
get it okay all right next let's pay
attention to what happens to the grips

278
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
attention to what happens to the grips
 

279
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,110
attention to what happens to the grips
with the inward spiral okay so we'll

280
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,120
with the inward spiral okay so we'll
 

281
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,670
with the inward spiral okay so we'll
watch this s

282
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:30,680
watch this s
 

283
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,670
watch this s
okay there she was at the

284
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
okay there she was at the
 

285
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,550
okay there she was at the
bait but as I start to go around you

286
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
bait but as I start to go around you
 

287
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,310
bait but as I start to go around you
start to

288
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,320
start to
 

289
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,029
start to
have

290
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
have
 

291
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,230
have
this wedging out that starts to happen

292
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
this wedging out that starts to happen
 

293
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,470
this wedging out that starts to happen
Okay as you're continuing your inward

294
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480

 

295
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,910

spirals what I want to

296
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
spirals what I want to
 

297
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,990
spirals what I want to
do is give her

298
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
do is give her
 

299
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,389
do is give her
that and not wedge out when you feel

300
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
that and not wedge out when you feel
 

301
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,990
that and not wedge out when you feel
yourself wedging out that means you've

302
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,000
yourself wedging out that means you've
 

303
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,030
yourself wedging out that means you've
hit the in phase of that technique and

304
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
hit the in phase of that technique and
 

305
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,269
hit the in phase of that technique and
you need to transition okay if you watch

306
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:08,279
you need to transition okay if you watch
 

307
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,190
you need to transition okay if you watch
on this hand it's going to happen too

308
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
on this hand it's going to happen too
 

309
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,509
on this hand it's going to happen too
it's right here which is what you want

310
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
it's right here which is what you want
 

311
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,230
it's right here which is what you want
on this hand I want to more or less

312
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,240
on this hand I want to more or less
 

313
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,310
on this hand I want to more or less
escape from this grip

314
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
escape from this grip
 

315
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,110
escape from this grip
okay it's this hand that we have to do

316
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,120
okay it's this hand that we have to do
 

317
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,949
okay it's this hand that we have to do
something different we starts in the

318
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:23,959
something different we starts in the
 

319
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,829
something different we starts in the
inward spiral but then it gives her that

320
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
inward spiral but then it gives her that
 

321
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,990
inward spiral but then it gives her that
where I hold her now

322
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000

 

323
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,630

okay and I

324
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:43,640

together side by side which is always
 

333
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,509
together side by side which is always
the launching point for Pok ho

334
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
the launching point for Pok ho
 

335
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,790
the launching point for Pok ho
want to have my feet like

336
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:01,800

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
here I'll have
 

511
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,069
here I'll have
her um press her Palm on me so my hand

512
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
her um press her Palm on me so my hand
 

513
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,670
her um press her Palm on me so my hand
is adhering

514
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
is adhering
 

515
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,990
is adhering
is my point not my grip I'm not pulling

516
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
is my point not my grip I'm not pulling
 

517
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,550
is my point not my grip I'm not pulling
her her Palm is on me and my wrist

518
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
her her Palm is on me and my wrist
 

519
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,670
her her Palm is on me and my wrist
adheres as

520
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:40,680
adheres as
 

521
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,949
adheres as
well my body is not this far from her

522
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
well my body is not this far from her
 

523
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,509
well my body is not this far from her
but it starts to wrap okay and she will

524
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
but it starts to wrap okay and she will
 

525
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,509
but it starts to wrap okay and she will
eventually feel me on my back on her

526
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
eventually feel me on my back on her
 

527
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,350
eventually feel me on my back on her
arm okay she feels that

528
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,360
arm okay she feels that
 

529
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,629
arm okay she feels that
and so that is what I'm using on the

530
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:03,639
and so that is what I'm using on the
 

531
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,829
and so that is what I'm using on the
adhesion this is the mechanism of the

532
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
adhesion this is the mechanism of the
 

533
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,670
adhesion this is the mechanism of the
turn I know what the turn needs to do

534
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:08,680
turn I know what the turn needs to do
 

535
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,030
turn I know what the turn needs to do
and I know I have to be in a certain

536
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,040
and I know I have to be in a certain
 

537
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,309
and I know I have to be in a certain
space time to make that happen because I

538
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:12,319
space time to make that happen because I
 

539
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:18,069
space time to make that happen because I
need her to turn around so all that I do

540
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
need her to turn around so all that I do
 

541
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,470
need her to turn around so all that I do
boom there's the

542
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
boom there's the
 

543
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:29,910
boom there's the

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920

 

545
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,590

and then for this technique for khole I

546
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
and then for this technique for khole I
 

547
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,949
and then for this technique for khole I
have to be I'm going to slow it down I

548
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
have to be I'm going to slow it down I
 

549
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:36,829
have to be I'm going to slow it down I
have to

550
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
have to
 

551
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,110
have to
be very close here stay there please on

00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:55,959

 

563
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,309

again boom there's the turn

564
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:00,319
again boom there's the turn
 

565
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:05,029
again boom there's the turn
here's that hand and my we are looking

566
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
here's that hand and my we are looking
 

567
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,110
here's that hand and my we are looking
the same way so I turn till I keep

568
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,120
the same way so I turn till I keep
 

569
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,510
the same way so I turn till I keep
looking the same way and she turned

570
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:10,520
looking the same way and she turned
 

571
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,069
looking the same way and she turned
around and then my feet will be behind

572
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,079
around and then my feet will be behind
 

573
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,230
around and then my feet will be behind
her and that's where the x pattern is

574
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,240

 

575
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,390

here so go one boom I turn her I'm there

576
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,400
here so go one boom I turn her I'm there
 

577
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,950
here so go one boom I turn her I'm there
in place in I go okay so I'll take the x

578
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
in place in I go okay so I'll take the x
 

579
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,870
in place in I go okay so I'll take the x
pattern out here Yas can't do it so but

580
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
pattern out here Yas can't do it so but
 

581
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,540
pattern out here Yas can't do it so but
everything else is the

582
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,550
everything else is the

same turn her

586
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
same turn her
 

587
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,430
same turn her
there so even if I don't do the x

588
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
there so even if I don't do the x
 

589
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
there so even if I don't do the x
pattern you should still

590
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:49,770
pattern you should still

598
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:01,720
so that you don't

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,430
so that you don't
go this way parallel to

600
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
go this way parallel to
 

601
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,909
go this way parallel to
it so I won't

602
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
it so I won't
 

603
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,510
it so I won't
displace but I'm kind of diagonal

604
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
displace but I'm kind of diagonal
 

605
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,070

609
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,750

okay lastly let's look at the Y hand at

610
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:44,760
okay lastly let's look at the Y hand at
 

611
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,390
okay lastly let's look at the Y hand at
the end and let us understand that this

612
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
the end and let us understand that this
 

613
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,470
the end and let us understand that this
khole is actually an inward

614
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:51,480
khole is actually an inward
 

615
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,990
khole is actually an inward

616
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
spiral going
 

617
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,549
spiral going
up I know it looks like this but we

618
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:57,559
up I know it looks like this but we
 

619
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,149
up I know it looks like this but we
don't have that shape

620
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:00,159
don't have that shape
 

621
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,990
don't have that shape
okay so it goes up and I am turning is

622
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
okay so it goes up and I am turning is
 

623
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,350
okay so it goes up and I am turning is
what's

624
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
what's
 

625
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,390
what's
happening so if you mark my elbow here I

626
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
happening so if you mark my elbow here I
 

627
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,750
happening so if you mark my elbow here I
am again on that 12 to six line so as it

628
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:14,760
am again on that 12 to six line so as it
 

629
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,350
am again on that 12 to six line so as it
goes up if I stay still my elbow stays

630
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,360
goes up if I stay still my elbow stays
 

631
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,510
goes up if I stay still my elbow stays
on that 12 to six

632
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,520
on that 12 to six
 

633
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,830
on that 12 to six
line but as I turn that elbow is moving

634
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
line but as I turn that elbow is moving
 

635
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,350
line but as I turn that elbow is moving
West and it's coming on this side of the

636
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,360
West and it's coming on this side of the
 

637
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,549
West and it's coming on this side of the
line

638
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:29,559
line
 

639
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,110
line
okay and this is how you do all of the C

640
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
okay and this is how you do all of the C
 

641
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,549
okay and this is how you do all of the C
hole of this very end okay so it's

642
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:35,559
hole of this very end okay so it's
 

643
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,549
hole of this very end okay so it's
always this shape and I've turned inside

644
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
always this shape and I've turned inside
 

645
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,310
always this shape and I've turned inside
of

646
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,320

 

647
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,310

it never this shape and this they always

648
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,320
it never this shape and this they always
 

649
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,950
it never this shape and this they always
look like that but it's not that okay

650
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:47,960
look like that but it's not that okay
 

651
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,310
look like that but it's not that okay
again I don't have this

652
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
again I don't have this
 

653
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,029
again I don't have this
shape so we go do that side again and

654
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:54,039
shape so we go do that side again and
 

655
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,350
shape so we go do that side again and
we're going to wash this hand now okay

656
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
we're going to wash this hand now okay
 

657
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,789
we're going to wash this hand now okay
as it goes so it goes into the inward

658
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
as it goes so it goes into the inward
 

659
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,830
as it goes so it goes into the inward
spiral up keep your grips

660
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:06,840
spiral up keep your grips
 

661
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,270
spiral up keep your grips
up you see and as I'm turning as I'm

662
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:10,280
up you see and as I'm turning as I'm
 

663
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,710
up you see and as I'm turning as I'm
starting to turn her we'll let go of

664
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
starting to turn her we'll let go of
 

665
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,710
starting to turn her we'll let go of
that for now you can see that you're

666
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:15,720
that for now you can see that you're
 

667

going to get the
 

669
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,990
going to get the
adhesion on the chin I'm s on the her

670
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,000
adhesion on the chin I'm s on the her
