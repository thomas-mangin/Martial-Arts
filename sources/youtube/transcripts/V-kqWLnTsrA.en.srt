1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,030

let's see

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
let's see
 

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,509
let's see
we're gonna go into more of the the how

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
we're gonna go into more of the the how
 

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,549
we're gonna go into more of the the how
and the why of training

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
and the why of training
 

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,910
and the why of training
so that your practice has a kind of road

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
so that your practice has a kind of road
 

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,630
so that your practice has a kind of road
map a kind of orientation

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640

 

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,750

but you must be careful

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
but you must be careful
 

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,429
but you must be careful
that you're not

14
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
that you're not
 

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,830
that you're not
chasing the priestly or the academic

16
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
chasing the priestly or the academic
 

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,229
chasing the priestly or the academic
concerns so as you remember

18
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239

 

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,910

i was academic and i realized

20
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
i was academic and i realized
 

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,910
i was academic and i realized
um that

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
um that
 

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,709
um that
it at first is very interesting and it's

24
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
it at first is very interesting and it's
 

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,150
it at first is very interesting and it's
very helpful

26
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
very helpful
 

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,189
very helpful
but it is its own kind of culture and it

28
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
but it is its own kind of culture and it
 

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,349
but it is its own kind of culture and it
has its own kind of

30
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
has its own kind of
 

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,910
has its own kind of
capital and then your own kind of

32
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
capital and then your own kind of
 

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,630
capital and then your own kind of
investment

34
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
investment
 

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,950
investment
and eventually it has its own kind of

36
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
and eventually it has its own kind of
 

37
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,670
and eventually it has its own kind of
motivation and it takes you away

38
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
motivation and it takes you away
 

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,789
motivation and it takes you away
from the experience and so i

40
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
from the experience and so i
 

41
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,190
from the experience and so i
gave you a kind of very simplified

42
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
gave you a kind of very simplified
 

43
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,030
gave you a kind of very simplified
cultural theory

44
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
cultural theory
 

45
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,630
cultural theory
uh to explain what i've lived through

46
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
uh to explain what i've lived through
 

47
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,870
uh to explain what i've lived through
um so that you can be on guard against

48
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
um so that you can be on guard against
 

49
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,590
um so that you can be on guard against
it okay

50
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
it okay
 

51
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,789
it okay
so in

52
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
so in
 

53
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,429
so in
my field was the history of religions

54
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
my field was the history of religions
 

55
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,710
my field was the history of religions
and

56
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
and
 

57
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,510
and
what i tended to see was that you always

58
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
what i tended to see was that you always
 

59
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,630
what i tended to see was that you always
had

60
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
had
 

61
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,469
had
uh this experience

62
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
uh this experience
 

63
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,710
uh this experience
this realization a very individual

64
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
this realization a very individual
 

65
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,230
this realization a very individual
like or individualistic

66
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240

 

67
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,510

subjective experience

68
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
subjective experience
 

69
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,389
subjective experience
that happened or realization and

70
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
that happened or realization and
 

71
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,910
that happened or realization and
eventually

72
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
eventually
 

73
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,910
eventually
that tradition it becomes a tradition

74
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
that tradition it becomes a tradition
 

75
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,389
that tradition it becomes a tradition
as it becomes social so that person

76
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
as it becomes social so that person
 

77
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,190
as it becomes social so that person
will now meet someone else they want to

78
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
will now meet someone else they want to
 

79
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,749
will now meet someone else they want to
have this

80
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
have this
 

81
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,710
have this
a realization and it starts to become

82
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
a realization and it starts to become
 

83
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,710
a realization and it starts to become
social

84
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
social
 

85
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,910
social
and as that happens you start to see

86
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
and as that happens you start to see
 

87
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,830
and as that happens you start to see
a displacement of the experience

88
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
a displacement of the experience
 

89
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,270
a displacement of the experience
for the method okay

90
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
for the method okay
 

91
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,470
for the method okay
and you start to when you have that

92
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
and you start to when you have that
 

93
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,150
and you start to when you have that
displacement of the

94
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
displacement of the
 

95
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,830
displacement of the
method over the experience

96
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
method over the experience
 

97
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,150
method over the experience
and you combine that and the only reason

98
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
and you combine that and the only reason
 

99
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,110
and you combine that and the only reason
you would have that

100
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
you would have that
 

101
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,949
you would have that
is because you have people who don't

102
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
is because you have people who don't
 

103
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,710
is because you have people who don't
have the experience

104
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
have the experience
 

105
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,229
have the experience
do you see and those people organize

106
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
do you see and those people organize
 

107
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,550
do you see and those people organize
themselves now according to the method

108
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
themselves now according to the method
 

109
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,949
themselves now according to the method
this is how you get dogma religious

110
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:47,959
this is how you get dogma religious
 

111
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,229
this is how you get dogma religious
institutions a priestly class

112
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
institutions a priestly class
 

113
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,350
institutions a priestly class
or caste something like that and

114
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
or caste something like that and
 

115
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,589
or caste something like that and
eventually you have

116
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
eventually you have
 

117
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,710
eventually you have
empty rituals or

118
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
empty rituals or
 

119
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,750
empty rituals or
dead dogmas and

120
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
dead dogmas and
 

121
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,750
dead dogmas and
that happens throughout history we're

122
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
that happens throughout history we're
 

123
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,869
that happens throughout history we're
not the first

124
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
not the first
 

125
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,110
not the first
uh era where that's observable okay

126
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
uh era where that's observable okay
 

127
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,830
uh era where that's observable okay
so i have the experience or the

128
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
so i have the experience or the
 

129
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,830
so i have the experience or the
experience sir and then just to simplify

130
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
experience sir and then just to simplify
 

131
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,149
experience sir and then just to simplify
things i

132
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
things i
 

133
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,070
things i
give you this priestly moment or priest

134
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
give you this priestly moment or priest
 

135
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,070
give you this priestly moment or priest
moment and so here's where you have that

136
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080

 

137
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,869

subjective realization

138
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879

 

139
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,190

and then here's where you have method

140
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200

 

141
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,630

over experience

142
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640

 

143
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,710

and out of this because it starts its

144
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
and out of this because it starts its
 

145
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,869
and out of this because it starts its
own kind of capital system made up of

146
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
own kind of capital system made up of
 

147
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,789
own kind of capital system made up of
actual material capital

148
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
actual material capital
 

149
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,869
actual material capital
but also in terms of symbolic and

150
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
but also in terms of symbolic and
 

151
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,470
but also in terms of symbolic and
cultural capital

152
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
cultural capital
 

153
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,509
cultural capital
uh and everyone's now playing that game

154
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
uh and everyone's now playing that game
 

155
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,990
uh and everyone's now playing that game
okay so i want priestly rank i want

uh there comes a moment where you have

162
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
uh there comes a moment where you have
 

163
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,789
uh there comes a moment where you have
specialists

164
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
specialists
 

165
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,469
specialists
in the method okay

166
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
in the method okay
 

167
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,749
in the method okay
and that starts to produce what i call a

168
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
and that starts to produce what i call a
 

169
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,870
and that starts to produce what i call a
meta discourse

170
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
meta discourse
 

171
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,990
meta discourse
it's like i know i'm not even

172
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
it's like i know i'm not even
 

173
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,830
it's like i know i'm not even
having the method over the experience

174
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
having the method over the experience
 

175
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,909
having the method over the experience
i'm now just talking about method

176
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
i'm now just talking about method
 

177
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,790
i'm now just talking about method
okay i might not even do the method i

symbolic capital uh you know because i'm
an expert in it and so this

198
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
an expert in it and so this
 

199
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,510
an expert in it and so this
i call an academic

200
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520

 

201
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,310

phase okay and this is marked by the

202
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
phase okay and this is marked by the
 

203
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,110
phase okay and this is marked by the
production of this meta discourse

204
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
production of this meta discourse
 

205
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,670
production of this meta discourse
so this is the discourse now i'm talking

206
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
so this is the discourse now i'm talking
 

207
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,189
so this is the discourse now i'm talking
about the discourse

208
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
about the discourse
 

209
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,710
about the discourse
and that's a meta discourse

210
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720

 

211
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,230

so you see that all the time this

212
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
so you see that all the time this
 

213
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,350
so you see that all the time this
is a cultural phenomena that happens

214
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
is a cultural phenomena that happens
 

215
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,550
is a cultural phenomena that happens
and it also happens and this is why it's

216
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
and it also happens and this is why it's
 

217
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,749
and it also happens and this is why it's
important for us

218
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
important for us
 

219
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,150
important for us
it happens at the individual level you

220
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
it happens at the individual level you
 

221
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,550
it happens at the individual level you
lose

222
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
lose
 

223
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,310
lose
track of what you're after

224
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320

 

225
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,189

and you start to just become ritualists

226
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
and you start to just become ritualists
 

227
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,070
and you start to just become ritualists
or dogmatists

228
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
or dogmatists
 

229
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,029
or dogmatists
in many ways the experience will always

230
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
in many ways the experience will always
 

231
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,830
in many ways the experience will always
resist the dogma

232
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
resist the dogma
 

233
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,870
resist the dogma
always which is why a tradition like

234
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
always which is why a tradition like
 

235
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,749
always which is why a tradition like
zen will say it's beyond words and then

236
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
zen will say it's beyond words and then
 

237
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,670
zen will say it's beyond words and then
throughout zen's history

238
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
throughout zen's history
 

239
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,830
throughout zen's history
you'll have this

240
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840

 

241
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,390

fetishization of language

242
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
fetishization of language
 

243
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,629
fetishization of language
and then a subversion of language is

244
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
and then a subversion of language is
 

245
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,590
and then a subversion of language is
like they went too

246
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
like they went too
 

247
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,950
like they went too
far so you have your koans which is a

248
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
far so you have your koans which is a
 

249
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,909
far so you have your koans which is a
subversion of dogma a subversion

250
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
subversion of dogma a subversion
 

251
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,830
subversion of dogma a subversion
of um the sutras

252
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
of um the sutras
 

253
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,909
of um the sutras
were going to operate outside of the

254
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
were going to operate outside of the
 

255
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,990
were going to operate outside of the
sutras but then everyone started

256
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
sutras but then everyone started
 

257
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,990
sutras but then everyone started
memorizing

258
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
memorizing
 

259
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,390
memorizing
the answers to the koans they started to

260
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
the answers to the koans they started to
 

261
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,830
the answers to the koans they started to
be recorded

262
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
be recorded
 

263
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,710
be recorded
and you had people now just repeating

264
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
and you had people now just repeating
 

265
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,510
and you had people now just repeating
them

266
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
them
 

267
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,909
them
uh and then you would have characters

268
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
uh and then you would have characters
 

269
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,350
uh and then you would have characters
like eq

270
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
like eq
 

271
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,870
like eq
who would talk about like this this is

272
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
who would talk about like this this is
 

273
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,390
who would talk about like this this is
stupid okay and he would subvert that

274
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
stupid okay and he would subvert that
 

275
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,710
stupid okay and he would subvert that
and uh you know his his act

276
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
and uh you know his his act
 

277
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,390
and uh you know his his act
of spending half his life in the temple

278
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
of spending half his life in the temple
 

279
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,430
of spending half his life in the temple
and the second half of his life uh

280
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
and the second half of his life uh
 

281
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,469
and the second half of his life uh
in love with someone and in living

282
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
in love with someone and in living
 

283
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,510
in love with someone and in living
in a whorehouse is him getting

284
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
in a whorehouse is him getting
 

285
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,710
in a whorehouse is him getting
past the method and back to the

286
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
past the method and back to the
 

287
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,909
past the method and back to the
experience

288
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
experience
 

289
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,150
experience
okay

290
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160

 

291
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,390

you're going you have to struggle with

292
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
you're going you have to struggle with
 

293
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
you're going you have to struggle with
this individually

294
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
this individually
 

295
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,430
this individually
and the reason for it that is there's a

296
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
and the reason for it that is there's a
 

297
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,430
and the reason for it that is there's a
psychological reason

298
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
psychological reason
 

299
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,070
psychological reason
okay

300
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080

 

301
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,510

these two aspects

302
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
these two aspects
 

303
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,710
these two aspects
are fed by the

304
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
are fed by the
 

305
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,350
are fed by the
ego tripartite

306
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360

 

307
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:48,390

that we talked about before

308
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400

 

309
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,670

and so they will speak to us more uh

310
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
and so they will speak to us more uh
 

311
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,990
and so they will speak to us more uh
succinctly more easily we will

312
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
succinctly more easily we will
 

313
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,510
succinctly more easily we will
understand them much much more

314
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
understand them much much more
 

315
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,950
understand them much much more
um they will

316
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
um they will
 

317
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,430
um they will
operate as we said last time through

318
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
operate as we said last time through
 

319
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,430
operate as we said last time through
things like fear

320
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
things like fear
 

321
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,670
things like fear
pride and ignorance

322
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680

 

323
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,710

and they will also

324
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
and they will also
 

325
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,270
and they will also
of course function

326
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280

 

327
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,550

through our will to power and this will

328
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
through our will to power and this will
 

329
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,790
through our will to power and this will
be manifested over and over and over

330
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
be manifested over and over and over
 

331
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,670
be manifested over and over and over
again

332
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
again
 

333
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,149
again
so when you have a character like eq

334
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159

 

335
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,509

and you look at his act of

336
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
and you look at his act of
 

337
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,709
and you look at his act of
being very very critical

338
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
being very very critical
 

339
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,110
being very very critical
of the zen of his times to the point

340
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
of the zen of his times to the point
 

341
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,149
of the zen of his times to the point
where he just turns it on his head

342
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
where he just turns it on his head
 

343
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,470
where he just turns it on his head
he falls in love with the woman and he

344
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
he falls in love with the woman and he
 

345
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,829
he falls in love with the woman and he
goes and lives

346
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
goes and lives
 

347
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,070
goes and lives
in a whorehouse which is the exact

348
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
in a whorehouse which is the exact
 

349
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,870
in a whorehouse which is the exact
opposite

350
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
opposite
 

351
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,829
opposite
of the pure land that the temple

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
how and why for orientation reasons of
 

521
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,870
how and why for orientation reasons of
your training because

522
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
your training because
 

523
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,069
your training because
we don't want to go oh how and why

524
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
we don't want to go oh how and why
 

525
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,750
we don't want to go oh how and why
dogma and metadiscourse okay we don't

526
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
dogma and metadiscourse okay we don't
 

527
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,430
dogma and metadiscourse okay we don't
want to do that

528
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
want to do that
 

529
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,710
want to do that
okay all right

530
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720

 

531
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,629

i think as a historian the main problem

532
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
i think as a historian the main problem
 

533
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,509
i think as a historian the main problem
to knowing the how and why of budo and

534
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
to knowing the how and why of budo and
 

535
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,310
to knowing the how and why of budo and
aikido

536
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
aikido
 

537
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,550
aikido
is the epistemic rift that has occurred

538
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
is the epistemic rift that has occurred
 

539
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,350
is the epistemic rift that has occurred
between

540
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
between
 

541
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,990
between
what we'll call pre-modern and modern

542
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
what we'll call pre-modern and modern
 

543
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,870
what we'll call pre-modern and modern
thinking

544
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
thinking
 

545
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,310
thinking
okay um and i've mentioned

546
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
okay um and i've mentioned
 

547
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,670
okay um and i've mentioned
it before so the pre-modern

548
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
it before so the pre-modern
 

549
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,310
it before so the pre-modern
epistemy is what i call concentric

550
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
epistemy is what i call concentric
 

551
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,949
epistemy is what i call concentric
in nature okay

552
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959

 

553
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,350

and the best analogy that i can give you

554
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
and the best analogy that i can give you
 

555
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,629
and the best analogy that i can give you
is kind of like russian stacking dolls

556
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
is kind of like russian stacking dolls
 

557
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,910
is kind of like russian stacking dolls
the the doll is inside the doll is

558
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
the the doll is inside the doll is
 

559
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,030
the the doll is inside the doll is
inside the doll

560
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
inside the doll
 

561
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,389
inside the doll
and it is the same doll but it's also

562
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
and it is the same doll but it's also
 

563
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,750
and it is the same doll but it's also
not the same though

564
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
not the same though
 

565
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,870
not the same though
okay um

566
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880

 

567
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,150

this thinking might appear to us to be

568
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
this thinking might appear to us to be
 

569
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,189
this thinking might appear to us to be
very illogical but in fact

570
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
very illogical but in fact
 

571
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,949
very illogical but in fact
it is a logic or reason followed out to

572
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
it is a logic or reason followed out to
 

573
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,870
it is a logic or reason followed out to
its extreme

574
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
its extreme
 

575
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,069
its extreme
and the place that you see this

576
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
and the place that you see this
 

577
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,269
and the place that you see this
most prevalent is in an indian

578
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
most prevalent is in an indian
 

579
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,870
most prevalent is in an indian
philosopher called nagarjuna

580
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880

 

581
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,069

okay and he came up with uh he's trying

582
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
okay and he came up with uh he's trying
 

583
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,269
okay and he came up with uh he's trying
to look at reason

584
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
to look at reason
 

585
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,069
to look at reason
in buddhist philosophy and he came up

586
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
in buddhist philosophy and he came up
 

587
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,870
in buddhist philosophy and he came up
with this

588
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
with this
 

589
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,030
with this
uh what can we say about reality and

590
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
uh what can we say about reality and
 

591
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,030
uh what can we say about reality and
it's known as his tetralemma

592
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
it's known as his tetralemma
 

593
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,430
it's known as his tetralemma
okay so i'm going to represent it so uh

594
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
okay so i'm going to represent it so uh
 

595
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,189
okay so i'm going to represent it so uh
a a is a it is this is that

596
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
a a is a it is this is that
 

597
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,949
a a is a it is this is that
you can say that or this is this

598
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
you can say that or this is this
 

599
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,389
you can say that or this is this
we're going to represent that as a is a

600
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
we're going to represent that as a is a
 

601
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,069
we're going to represent that as a is a
that is one thing you can look at the

602
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
that is one thing you can look at the
 

603
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,590
that is one thing you can look at the
world and you go uh

604
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
world and you go uh
 

605
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,430
world and you go uh
that is a map a mat is a map a is a

606
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
that is a map a mat is a map a is a
 

607
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,629
that is a map a mat is a map a is a
okay but you're going to see eventually

608
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
okay but you're going to see eventually
 

609
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,990
okay but you're going to see eventually
that

610
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
that
 

611
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,670
that
a is not a or a equals b

612
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
a is not a or a equals b
 

613
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,430
a is not a or a equals b
so this is a map right but you find out

614
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
so this is a map right but you find out
 

615
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,990
so this is a map right but you find out
that it's

616
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
that it's
 

617
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,230
that it's
it's often much much more than that to

618
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
it's often much much more than that to
 

619
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,230
it's often much much more than that to
somebody so for example

620
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
somebody so for example
 

621
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,949
somebody so for example
uh you people freak out you have your

622
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
uh you people freak out you have your
 

623
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,389
uh you people freak out you have your
shoes on the mat

624
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
shoes on the mat
 

625
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,350
shoes on the mat
do you see uh it's more than a map then

626
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
do you see uh it's more than a map then
 

627
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,829
do you see uh it's more than a map then
isn't it

628
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
isn't it
 

629
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,670
isn't it
apparently it's more than a map okay um

630
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
apparently it's more than a map okay um
 

631
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,150
apparently it's more than a map okay um
and then once i allow for those two

632
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
and then once i allow for those two
 

633
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,189
and then once i allow for those two
propositions

634
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
propositions
 

635
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,269
propositions
um or you know so so here we are

636
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
um or you know so so here we are
 

637
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,350
um or you know so so here we are
matt isn't matt matt is not outside

638
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
matt isn't matt matt is not outside
 

639
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,949
matt isn't matt matt is not outside
do you see that that's a mat it's more

640
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
do you see that that's a mat it's more
 

641
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,030
do you see that that's a mat it's more
than a map okay

642
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
than a map okay
 

643
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,870
than a map okay
and then once i allow for those two

644
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
and then once i allow for those two
 

645
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,310
and then once i allow for those two
propositions then by a

646
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
propositions then by a
 

647
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,509
propositions then by a
reasonable extension um

648
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
reasonable extension um
 

649
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,030
reasonable extension um
you're going to have a

650
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
you're going to have a
 

651
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,470
you're going to have a
uh not to it okay so you're going to

652
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
uh not to it okay so you're going to
 

653
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,189
uh not to it okay so you're going to
have

654
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
have
 

655
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,710
have
uh a is not b so i had a is a

656
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
uh a is not b so i had a is a
 

657
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,749
uh a is not b so i had a is a
and then i have here a is not a a is not

658
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
and then i have here a is not a a is not
 

659
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,230
and then i have here a is not a a is not
a

660
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
a
 

661
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,269
a
probably better right and because i

662
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
probably better right and because i
 

663
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,230
probably better right and because i
allow for that

664
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
allow for that
 

665
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,949
allow for that
i can have a does not equal not a of

666
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
i can have a does not equal not a of
 

667
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,310
i can have a does not equal not a of
course

668
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
course
 

669
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,790
course
you see this is how you do it and then

670
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
you see this is how you do it and then
 

671
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,949
you see this is how you do it and then
uh what you're going to find is well it

672
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
uh what you're going to find is well it
 

673
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:03,430
uh what you're going to find is well it
is

674
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
is
 

675
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,269
is
it is once i allow that i have the

676
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
it is once i allow that i have the
 

677
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,949
it is once i allow that i have the
fourth logical extension

678
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
fourth logical extension
 

679
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,069
fourth logical extension
and then the thing is both so a

680
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
and then the thing is both so a
 

681
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,189
and then the thing is both so a
equals uh not a and a and

682
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
equals uh not a and a and
 

683
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,350
equals uh not a and a and
a okay so write this out in english

684
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360

 

685
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,710

this thing is is not

686
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
this thing is is not
 

687
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,790
this thing is is not
is both and is neither

688
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
is both and is neither
 

689
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,670
is both and is neither
is it

690
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680

 

691
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,710

okay this is the logic so you take those

692
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
okay this is the logic so you take those
 

693
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,030
okay this is the logic so you take those
russian dolls

694
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
russian dolls
 

695
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,550
russian dolls
and of course it's the same doll pattern

696
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560

 

697
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,590

but it's not the same doll

698
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
but it's not the same doll
 

699
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,509
but it's not the same doll
so because of that it is both

700
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
so because of that it is both
 

701
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,230
so because of that it is both
the same doll and not the same doll

702
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
the same doll and not the same doll
 

703
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,790
the same doll and not the same doll
right

704
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
right
 

705
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,430
right
and because of that it is neither nor

706
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
and because of that it is neither nor
 

707
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,110
and because of that it is neither nor
you you go by extension

708
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
you you go by extension
 

709
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,230
you you go by extension
okay and so the way

710
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
okay and so the way
 

711
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,270
okay and so the way
why is this concentric is

712
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
why is this concentric is
 

713
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,949
why is this concentric is
like the russian dolls is how you

714
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
like the russian dolls is how you
 

715
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,189
like the russian dolls is how you
understand it okay what what is

716
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
understand it okay what what is
 

717
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,309
understand it okay what what is
the scientific epistemy the scientific

718
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
the scientific epistemy the scientific
 

719
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,590
the scientific epistemy the scientific
epistemy

720
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
epistemy
 

721
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,189
epistemy
is only the first two something

722
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
is only the first two something
 

723
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,870
is only the first two something
it is or is not and that's all you get

724
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
it is or is not and that's all you get
 

725
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,230
it is or is not and that's all you get
okay um why whoa whoa

726
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
okay um why whoa whoa
 

727
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,549
okay um why whoa whoa
what about that no no don't even go

728
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
what about that no no don't even go
 

729
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,069
what about that no no don't even go
there okay

730
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
there okay
 

731
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,350
there okay
but as you'll see even in uh various

732
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
but as you'll see even in uh various
 

733
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,110
but as you'll see even in uh various
realms of science where they're pushing

734
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
realms of science where they're pushing
 

735
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,430
realms of science where they're pushing
the thinking just like nagarjuna did

736
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
the thinking just like nagarjuna did
 

737
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,750
the thinking just like nagarjuna did
hundreds and hundreds of years ago you

738
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
hundreds and hundreds of years ago you
 

739
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,789
hundreds and hundreds of years ago you
start to get

740
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
start to get
 

741
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,870
start to get
this thing all the time so it is both

742
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
this thing all the time so it is both
 

743
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,669
this thing all the time so it is both
a wave and a particle it is neither a

744
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
a wave and a particle it is neither a
 

745
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,510
a wave and a particle it is neither a
particle nor a weight you see

746
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
particle nor a weight you see
 

747
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,909
particle nor a weight you see
because it is just reason pushed to its

748
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
because it is just reason pushed to its
 

749
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,870
because it is just reason pushed to its
extreme

750
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
extreme
 

751
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,510
extreme
okay uh but most of the times when

752
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
okay uh but most of the times when
 

753
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,549
okay uh but most of the times when
you're operating

754
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
you're operating
 

755
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,950
you're operating
as a modern you're operating at what i

756
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
as a modern you're operating at what i
 

757
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,470
as a modern you're operating at what i
would call a pop lever

758
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
would call a pop lever
 

759
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,750
would call a pop lever
level of the scientific epistemy and

760
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
level of the scientific epistemy and
 

761
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,390
level of the scientific epistemy and
you're functioning here

762
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
you're functioning here
 

763
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,190
you're functioning here
now why is that important to know

764
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
now why is that important to know
 

765
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,270
now why is that important to know
because this leads to misunderstandings

766
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
because this leads to misunderstandings
 

767
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,710
because this leads to misunderstandings
in my aikido

768
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
in my aikido
 

769
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,909
in my aikido
and i don't under it's not a technology

770
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
and i don't under it's not a technology
 

771
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,230
and i don't under it's not a technology
invented through the modern epistemy

772
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
invented through the modern epistemy
 

773
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,070
invented through the modern epistemy
it's a technology invented through the

774
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
it's a technology invented through the
 

775
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,510
it's a technology invented through the
pre-modern epistemy

776
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
pre-modern epistemy
 

777
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,350
pre-modern epistemy
so it's not going to just function at

778
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
so it's not going to just function at
 

779
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,549
so it's not going to just function at
here why

780
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
here why
 

781
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,029
here why
why is that important okay because this

782
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
why is that important okay because this
 

783
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,830
why is that important okay because this
leads to

784
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
leads to
 

785
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,029
leads to
um analogy

786
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
um analogy
 

787
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,110
um analogy
and metaphor

788
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120

 

789
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,029

and that's how most of you understand

790
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
and that's how most of you understand
 

791
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,110
and that's how most of you understand
your aikido is through analogy and

792
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
your aikido is through analogy and
 

793
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,310
your aikido is through analogy and
metaphor

794
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
metaphor
 

795
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,430
metaphor
but the pre-moderns don't do that

796
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
but the pre-moderns don't do that
 

797
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,310
but the pre-moderns don't do that
um they're looking for this thing and

798
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
um they're looking for this thing and
 

799
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,029
um they're looking for this thing and
once i

800
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
once i
 

801
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,710
once i
have uh all four

802
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
have uh all four
 

803
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,470
have uh all four
reason conclusions

804
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
reason conclusions
 

805
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,990
reason conclusions
i actually don't have only analogy and

806
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
i actually don't have only analogy and
 

807
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,710
i actually don't have only analogy and
metaphor

808
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
metaphor
 

809
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,830
metaphor
but i have what is very important i have

810
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
but i have what is very important i have
 

811
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,270
but i have what is very important i have
communion

812
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280

 

813
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,950

those four things are happening

814
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
those four things are happening
 

815
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,470
those four things are happening
simultaneously

816
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
simultaneously
 

817
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,990
simultaneously
like the russian stacking balls

818
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
like the russian stacking balls
 

819
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,390
like the russian stacking balls
they are a unified system okay

820
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
they are a unified system okay
 

821
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,310
they are a unified system okay
we don't want to understand our art like

822
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
we don't want to understand our art like
 

823
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,190
we don't want to understand our art like
this because this is part of this

824
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
this because this is part of this
 

825
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,110
this because this is part of this
we want to understand our art like this

826
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
we want to understand our art like this
 

827
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,110
we want to understand our art like this
because this is part of this

828
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120

 

829
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,070

and i'll give you an example of that now

830
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
and i'll give you an example of that now
 

831
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,510
and i'll give you an example of that now
okay

832
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
okay
 

833
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,830
okay
so uh let's say he's gonna do ski and

834
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
so uh let's say he's gonna do ski and
 

835
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,590
so uh let's say he's gonna do ski and
here comes

836
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
here comes
 

837
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,630
here comes
a contesting energy

838
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
a contesting energy
 

839
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,029
a contesting energy
okay he's a and on b

840
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039

 

841
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,470

so he comes in and then

842
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
so he comes in and then
 

843
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,590
so he comes in and then
we know in aikido through our dogma and

844
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
we know in aikido through our dogma and
 

845
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,350
we know in aikido through our dogma and
our meta discourse

846
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
our meta discourse
 

847
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,950
our meta discourse
that i should become harmonious with

848
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
that i should become harmonious with
 

849
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,909
that i should become harmonious with
that thing

850
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
that thing
 

851
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,950
that thing
okay but because i don't understand

852
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
okay but because i don't understand
 

853
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,750
okay but because i don't understand
things concentrically

854
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
things concentrically
 

855
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,230
things concentrically
it's more of an analogy or a metaphor

856
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
it's more of an analogy or a metaphor
 

857
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,350
it's more of an analogy or a metaphor
for harmony

858
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
for harmony
 

859
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,549
for harmony

happens is the first two options go away
okay so as he as he comes in

912
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
okay so as he as he comes in
 

913
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,510
okay so as he as he comes in
and i go here and i i generate

914
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
and i go here and i i generate
 

915
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,230
and i go here and i i generate
uh my adhesion so i'm not grabbing him

916
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
uh my adhesion so i'm not grabbing him
 

917
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,350
uh my adhesion so i'm not grabbing him
because that would be a

918
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
because that would be a
 

919
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,630
because that would be a
and b so as as we're here

920
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
and b so as as we're here
 

921
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,909
and b so as as we're here
uh he he can't go backwards sure he

922
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
uh he he can't go backwards sure he
 

923
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,669
uh he he can't go backwards sure he
can't go backwards because

924
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
can't go backwards because
 

925
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,630
can't go backwards because
it just pulls him off balance and he can

926
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
it just pulls him off balance and he can
 

927
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,590
it just pulls him off balance and he can
go forward

928
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
go forward
 

929
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,270
go forward
and the reason he can is because i'm not

930
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
and the reason he can is because i'm not
 

931
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,870
and the reason he can is because i'm not
going backward or forward

932
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
going backward or forward
 

933
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,310
going backward or forward
you see and so we in the in the

934
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
you see and so we in the in the
 

935
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,190
you see and so we in the in the
internal ikea adhesion have become one

936
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
internal ikea adhesion have become one
 

937
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,630
internal ikea adhesion have become one
so i'm going to show you the difference

938
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
so i'm going to show you the difference
 

939
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,669
so i'm going to show you the difference
they kind of look the same so we go and

940
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
they kind of look the same so we go and
 

941
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,789
they kind of look the same so we go and
i'm going to do an external you see

942
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799

 

943
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,470

but if you pay attention they don't

944
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
but if you pay attention they don't
 

945
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,990
but if you pay attention they don't
sound the same and they don't really

946
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
sound the same and they don't really
 

947
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,870
sound the same and they don't really
look the same

948
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
look the same
 

949
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,110
look the same
so i'm going to do the same thing with

950
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
so i'm going to do the same thing with
 

951
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,590
so i'm going to do the same thing with
the high key adhesion

952
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
the high key adhesion
 

953
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,070
the high key adhesion
uh and you can test for it now so if i

954
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
uh and you can test for it now so if i
 

955
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,230
uh and you can test for it now so if i
do an external thing

956
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
do an external thing
 

957
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,190

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,310
and the more he tries because of things
we're going to go into

1026
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
we're going to go into
 

1027
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,510
we're going to go into
the more the adhesion shows up so uh

1028
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
the more the adhesion shows up so uh
 

1029
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,710
the more the adhesion shows up so uh
it's a nature it's nature working itself

1030
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
it's a nature it's nature working itself
 

1031
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,430
it's a nature it's nature working itself
the more he tries to pull the two forces

1032
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
the more he tries to pull the two forces
 

1033
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,470
the more he tries to pull the two forces
apart

1034
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
apart
 

1035
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,789
apart
the more the two forces hold themselves

1036
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
the more the two forces hold themselves
 

1037
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,110
the more the two forces hold themselves
together it's the way the universe works

1038
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
together it's the way the universe works
 

1039
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,750
together it's the way the universe works
okay

1040
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
okay
 

1041
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,630
okay
so in fact if he was very very relaxed

1042
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
so in fact if he was very very relaxed
 

1043
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,549
so in fact if he was very very relaxed
and loose and was not at all

1044
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
and loose and was not at all
 

1045
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,230
and loose and was not at all
manifesting a he's he's like a

1046
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
manifesting a he's he's like a
 

1047
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,669
manifesting a he's he's like a
ghost it's very much much harder

1048
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
ghost it's very much much harder
 

1049
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,430
ghost it's very much much harder
to get a to be both b

1050
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
to get a to be both b
 

1051
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,909
to get a to be both b
or neither b okay because he's not a

1052
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
or neither b okay because he's not a
 

1053
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,269
or neither b okay because he's not a
strong a

1054
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
strong a
 

1055
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,830
strong a
he's not an a with a lot of integrity

1056
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
he's not an a with a lot of integrity
 

1057
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,430
he's not an a with a lot of integrity
but the more that he

1058
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
but the more that he
 

1059
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,710
but the more that he
he pushes uh the more he's subject to

1060
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
he pushes uh the more he's subject to
 

1061
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,750
he pushes uh the more he's subject to
uh what i do to his balance you see you

1062
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
uh what i do to his balance you see you
 

1063
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,549
uh what i do to his balance you see you
get that

1064
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
get that
 

1065
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,390
get that
so it's not an analogy

1066
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
so it's not an analogy
 

1067
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,310
so it's not an analogy
of of uh not contesting it's

1068
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
of of uh not contesting it's
 

1069
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,990
of of uh not contesting it's
actually a concentric unification of

1070
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
actually a concentric unification of
 

1071
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,350
actually a concentric unification of
a and b or if you want to pause it

1072
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
a and b or if you want to pause it
 

1073
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,990
a and b or if you want to pause it
negatively a and b disappear so it's

1074
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
negatively a and b disappear so it's
 

1075
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,350
negatively a and b disappear so it's
neither at that moment

1076
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
neither at that moment
 

1077
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,630
neither at that moment
he's not a and i'm not b or both

1078
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
he's not a and i'm not b or both
 

1079
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,549
he's not a and i'm not b or both
a and b equals the same thing it's how

1080
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
a and b equals the same thing it's how
 

1081
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,149
a and b equals the same thing it's how
you understand okay

1082
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
you understand okay
 

1083
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,310
you understand okay
so we go and uh

1084
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
so we go and uh
 

1085
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,430
so we go and uh
let's have it where um

1086
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
let's have it where um
 

1087
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,070
let's have it where um
he is going to play with what i'm doing

1088
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
he is going to play with what i'm doing
 

1089
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,710
he is going to play with what i'm doing
okay but i will never grab

1090
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
okay but i will never grab
 

1091
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,510
okay but i will never grab
okay to grab is to manifest b and then

1092
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
okay to grab is to manifest b and then
 

1093
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,630
okay to grab is to manifest b and then
i'm back in the

1094
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
i'm back in the
 

1095
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,750
i'm back in the
number two a does not equal b okay so

1096
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
number two a does not equal b okay so
 

1097
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,149
number two a does not equal b okay so
there's no need to grab

1098
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
there's no need to grab
 

1099
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,870
there's no need to grab
uh he's gonna do whatever see yeah he's

1100
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
uh he's gonna do whatever see yeah he's
 

1101
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,190
uh he's gonna do whatever see yeah he's
gonna

1102
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
gonna
 

1103
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,149
gonna
he's gonna move whatever so he can even

1104
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
he's gonna move whatever so he can even
 

1105
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,630
he's gonna move whatever so he can even
uh

1106
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
uh
 

1107
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,710
uh
throw the other strike if he wants it it

1108
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
throw the other strike if he wants it it
 

1109
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,830
throw the other strike if he wants it it
doesn't change

1110
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
doesn't change
 

1111
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,230
doesn't change
the relationship okay i might have to

1112
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
the relationship okay i might have to
 

1113
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,669
the relationship okay i might have to
move like for example

1114
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
move like for example
 

1115
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,350
move like for example
he throws that strike i don't want to go

1116
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
he throws that strike i don't want to go
 

1117
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,909
he throws that strike i don't want to go
like that okay

1118
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
like that okay
 

1119
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,909
like that okay
so he goes and i'm just going to do the

1120
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
so he goes and i'm just going to do the
 

1121
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,510
so he goes and i'm just going to do the
technique

1122
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520

 

1123
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,070

and i'm not trying to do kotakaish as a

1124
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
and i'm not trying to do kotakaish as a
 

1125
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,590
and i'm not trying to do kotakaish as a
self-defense against

1126
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
self-defense against
 

1127
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,830
self-defense against
that stupid punch i'm just generating

1128
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
that stupid punch i'm just generating
 

1129
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,950
that stupid punch i'm just generating
uh the first aspect of the

1130
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
uh the first aspect of the
 

1131
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,230
uh the first aspect of the
tetra llama the first two aspects a

1132
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
tetra llama the first two aspects a
 

1133
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,549
tetra llama the first two aspects a
does not equal b okay so he goes in

1134
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559
does not equal b okay so he goes in
 

1135
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,230
does not equal b okay so he goes in
i get the the uh communion

1136
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
i get the the uh communion
 

1137
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,789
i get the the uh communion
and uh he does whatever he wants to do

1138
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799

 

1139
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,149

and i'll do my technique okay

1140
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:06,159
and i'll do my technique okay
 

1141
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,230
and i'll do my technique okay
you might experience that everything

1142
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
you might experience that everything
 

1143
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,630
you might experience that everything
falls apart because i

1144
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
falls apart because i
 

1145
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,149
falls apart because i
wait i can't get to the third and fourth

1146
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
wait i can't get to the third and fourth
 

1147
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,110
wait i can't get to the third and fourth
aspects of the tetralemma but that's

1148
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
aspects of the tetralemma but that's
 

1149
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,630
aspects of the tetralemma but that's
getting us further along

1150
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
getting us further along
 

1151
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,950
getting us further along
than when we were operating with just

1152
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
than when we were operating with just
 

1153
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,830
than when we were operating with just
analogy or metaphor

1154
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:22,840
analogy or metaphor
 

1155
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,909
analogy or metaphor
okay so we're going to be on guard for

1156
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
okay so we're going to be on guard for
 

1157
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,830
okay so we're going to be on guard for
this happening within us

1158
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
this happening within us
 

1159
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,110
this happening within us
and of course we have to be

1160
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
and of course we have to be
 

1161
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,590
and of course we have to be
self-reflexive that it's actually

1162
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
self-reflexive that it's actually
 

1163
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,230
self-reflexive that it's actually
happening

1164
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
happening
 

1165
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,350
happening
culturally socially so most of aikido is

1166
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,360
culturally socially so most of aikido is
 

1167
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,470
culturally socially so most of aikido is
at this level

1168
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
at this level
 

1169
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,750
at this level
right overwhelming because most of

1170
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
right overwhelming because most of
 

1171
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,310
right overwhelming because most of
my aikido will have a tendency to

1172
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
my aikido will have a tendency to
 

1173
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,390
my aikido will have a tendency to
operate at that level

1174
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
operate at that level
 

1175
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,149
operate at that level
there's not some sinister mustache

1176
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
there's not some sinister mustache
 

1177
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,750
there's not some sinister mustache
twirling person

1178
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
twirling person
 

1179
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,950
twirling person
that's ruining aikido it's just this

1180
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
that's ruining aikido it's just this
 

1181
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,549
that's ruining aikido it's just this
speaks to my

1182
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
speaks to my
 

1183
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,669
speaks to my
uh ego tripartite and so most of us will

1184
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
uh ego tripartite and so most of us will
 

1185
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,390
uh ego tripartite and so most of us will
do this

1186
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
do this
 

1187
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,029
do this
okay and so at an individual level you

1188
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
okay and so at an individual level you
 

1189
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,470
okay and so at an individual level you
must be on guard

1190
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
must be on guard
 

1191
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,590
must be on guard
so i'm going to give you some

1192
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
so i'm going to give you some
 

1193
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,510
so i'm going to give you some
information

1194
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
information
 

1195
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,870
information
that had on why and be careful

1196
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880

 

1197
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,149

okay so in what is today

1198
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
okay so in what is today
 

1199
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,710
okay so in what is today
china going back to at least recorded

1200
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
china going back to at least recorded
 

1201
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,149
china going back to at least recorded
history so you're looking

1202
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
history so you're looking
 

1203
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,230
history so you're looking
at at least 500 bce

1204
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240

 

1205
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,269

there was a notion

1206
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
there was a notion
 

1207
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,950
there was a notion
of how the universe

1208
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
of how the universe
 

1209
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,549
of how the universe
all creation all life ev everything

1210
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
all creation all life ev everything
 

1211
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,590
all creation all life ev everything
all so therefore including me

1212
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
all so therefore including me
 

1213
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,549
all so therefore including me
and therefore including the nage uk

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
and therefore including the nage uk
 

1215
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,350
and therefore including the nage uk
relationship

1216
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
relationship
 

1217
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,310
relationship
and therefore the techniques of the art

1218
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320
and therefore the techniques of the art
 

1219
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,430
and therefore the techniques of the art
everything

1220
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
everything
 

1221
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,310
everything
is of this same concentric nature

1222
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
is of this same concentric nature
 

1223
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,070
is of this same concentric nature
they're the universe just keeps

1224
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
they're the universe just keeps
 

1225
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,110
they're the universe just keeps
repeating itself

1226
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
repeating itself
 

1227
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,230
repeating itself
over and over and over again okay and so

1228
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
over and over and over again okay and so
 

1229
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,909
over and over and over again okay and so
this is how you get

1230
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
this is how you get
 

1231
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,950
this is how you get
certain understandings um

1232
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
certain understandings um
 

1233
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,070
certain understandings um
one of them is uh heaven

1234
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080

 

1235
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,990

man earth

1236
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000

 

1237
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,070

and that's what we want to go in today

1238
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
and that's what we want to go in today
 

1239
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,269
and that's what we want to go in today
okay

1240
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
okay
 

1241
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,269
okay
because our understanding of this

1242
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
because our understanding of this
 

1243
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,870
because our understanding of this
concept cannot be

1244
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880
concept cannot be
 

1245
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,750
concept cannot be
one of analogy or metaphor it has to

1246
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
one of analogy or metaphor it has to
 

1247
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,710
one of analogy or metaphor it has to
include

1248
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
include
 

1249
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,549
include
uh this thing it has to be concentric

1250
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
uh this thing it has to be concentric
 

1251
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,750
uh this thing it has to be concentric
and i'll explain that as we go along

1252
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
and i'll explain that as we go along
 

1253
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,549
and i'll explain that as we go along
so we've already talked before how from

1254
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
so we've already talked before how from
 

1255
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,789
so we've already talked before how from
another discourse but and which never

1256
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
another discourse but and which never
 

1257
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,630
another discourse but and which never
contradicted this discourse they're all

1258
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
contradicted this discourse they're all
 

1259
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,110
contradicted this discourse they're all
just trying to say the same thing

1260
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
just trying to say the same thing
 

1261
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,430
just trying to say the same thing
we have that kind of numerology here we

1262
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
we have that kind of numerology here we
 

1263
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,590
we have that kind of numerology here we
have a kind of sacred geometry

1264
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
have a kind of sacred geometry
 

1265
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,750
have a kind of sacred geometry
but it's all discussing the same thing

1266
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
but it's all discussing the same thing
 

1267
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,110
but it's all discussing the same thing
it's people

1268
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
it's people
 

1269
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,029
it's people
in this class trying to

1270
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
in this class trying to
 

1271
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,149
in this class trying to
understand and explain to

1272
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
understand and explain to
 

1273
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,990
understand and explain to
non to people who haven't had the

1274
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
non to people who haven't had the
 

1275
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,590
non to people who haven't had the
experience yet

1276
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
experience yet
 

1277
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,630
experience yet
how you have the experience okay so

1278
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
how you have the experience okay so
 

1279
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,430
how you have the experience okay so
before we've talked about the dao um

1280
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
before we've talked about the dao um
 

1281
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,830
before we've talked about the dao um
and so there's just one thing that is

1282
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
and so there's just one thing that is
 

1283
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,149
and so there's just one thing that is
beyond all knowability because it is

1284
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
beyond all knowability because it is
 

1285
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,310
beyond all knowability because it is
beyond all duality

1286
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
beyond all duality
 

1287
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,750
beyond all duality
so it's void it's chaos it's it's

1288
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
so it's void it's chaos it's it's
 

1289
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,870
so it's void it's chaos it's it's
that okay and from the dao comes

1290
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
that okay and from the dao comes
 

1291
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,710
that okay and from the dao comes
uh the two things so i have this kind of

1292
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
uh the two things so i have this kind of
 

1293
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,990
uh the two things so i have this kind of
uh universal oneness

1294
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
uh universal oneness
 

1295
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,549
uh universal oneness
or again sometimes expressed in a

1296
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
or again sometimes expressed in a
 

1297
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,750
or again sometimes expressed in a
negative way

1298
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
negative way
 

1299
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,990
negative way
void this kind of zero-ness or this kind

1300
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
void this kind of zero-ness or this kind
 

1301
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,029
void this kind of zero-ness or this kind
of emptiness

1302
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
of emptiness
 

1303
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,110
of emptiness
and from that the two things come

1304
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
and from that the two things come
 

1305
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,630
and from that the two things come
and that's my yin and yang

1306
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640

 

1307
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,830

and then my yin and yam and so uh will

1308
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,840
and then my yin and yam and so uh will
 

1309
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,990
and then my yin and yam and so uh will
break off into four four into eight and

1310
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
break off into four four into eight and
 

1311
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,269
break off into four four into eight and
it just goes on

1312
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
it just goes on
 

1313
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,510
it just goes on
and then numbers are given value and

1314
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
and then numbers are given value and
 

1315
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,750
and then numbers are given value and
that's how you get these numerologies

1316
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
that's how you get these numerologies
 

1317
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,830
that's how you get these numerologies
and again uh you you're going to get

1318
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:52,840
and again uh you you're going to get
 

1319
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,990
and again uh you you're going to get
specialists

1320
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,000
specialists
 

1321
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,510
specialists
on the discourse and you start to in my

1322
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
on the discourse and you start to in my
 

1323
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,149
on the discourse and you start to in my
opinion

1324
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159
opinion
 

1325
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,830
opinion
this is what i mean when you made a

1326
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
this is what i mean when you made a
 

1327
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,269
this is what i mean when you made a
fetish out of the thing

1328
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
fetish out of the thing
 

1329
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,389
fetish out of the thing
now you're more conservative number two

1330
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
now you're more conservative number two
 

1331
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,070
now you're more conservative number two
i don't give a about number two

1332
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
i don't give a about number two
 

1333
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,669
i don't give a about number two
because in the end i

1334
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679
because in the end i
 

1335
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,950
because in the end i
i have this one you see which is how the

1336
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
i have this one you see which is how the
 

1337
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,389
i have this one you see which is how the
experiencer would do it

1338
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
experiencer would do it
 

1339
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,230
experiencer would do it
it's the same thing like um

1340
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240

 

1341
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,990

you know uh eq you're hiding out in the

1342
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
you know uh eq you're hiding out in the
 

1343
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,350
you know uh eq you're hiding out in the
whorehouse you're going to be

1344
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
whorehouse you're going to be
 

1345
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,830
whorehouse you're going to be
impure i don't give a about purity

1346
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
impure i don't give a about purity
 

1347
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,110
impure i don't give a about purity
and pollution

1348
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
and pollution
 

1349
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,110
and pollution
do you see he's he's gotten to the heart

1350
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
do you see he's he's gotten to the heart
 

1351
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,470
do you see he's he's gotten to the heart
of the matter

1352
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
of the matter
 

1353
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,789
of the matter
he's beyond purity and pollution it

1354
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
he's beyond purity and pollution it
 

1355
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,350
he's beyond purity and pollution it
doesn't matter where he's at now

1356
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
doesn't matter where he's at now
 

1357
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,630
doesn't matter where he's at now
the whorehouse is the pure land

1358
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640

 

1359
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,190

so this idea here

1360
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
so this idea here
 

1361
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,870
so this idea here
these are a using of this

1362
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
these are a using of this
 

1363
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,470
these are a using of this
reason to explain how the universe works

1364
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
reason to explain how the universe works
 

1365
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,590
reason to explain how the universe works
so

1366
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
so
 

1367
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,470
so
the universe is going to function and

1368
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
the universe is going to function and
 

1369
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,509
the universe is going to function and
this that there's a

1370
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
this that there's a
 

1371
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,789
this that there's a
underlying totality to it of some kind

1372
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
underlying totality to it of some kind
 

1373
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,070
underlying totality to it of some kind
and it has to it's it has to

1374
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
and it has to it's it has to
 

1375
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,310
and it has to it's it has to
manifest itself in by dividing

1376
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
manifest itself in by dividing
 

1377
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,029
manifest itself in by dividing
into two and then these two things keep

1378
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
into two and then these two things keep
 

1379
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,230
into two and then these two things keep
going and going

1380
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
going and going
 

1381
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,470
going and going
um and so though the world everything is

1382
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
um and so though the world everything is
 

1383
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,710
um and so though the world everything is
split up in yin and yang so right now

1384
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
split up in yin and yang so right now
 

1385
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,710
split up in yin and yang so right now
when you have your

1386
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
when you have your
 

1387
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,149
when you have your
last technique of the ski

1388
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159

00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
i did yin energy okay
 

1395
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,269
i did yin energy okay
but that is not a communion that's still

1396
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
but that is not a communion that's still
 

1397
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,549
but that is not a communion that's still
yin and yang existing so i'm still

1398
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
yin and yang existing so i'm still
 

1399
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,310
yin and yang existing so i'm still
operating at this level as i said

1400
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
operating at this level as i said
 

1401
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,149

the yin and yang division goes away
 

1415
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,590
the yin and yang division goes away
and we become one and we return

1416
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
and we become one and we return
 

1417
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,389
and we become one and we return
to the natural workings of the universe

1418
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
to the natural workings of the universe
 

1419

okay
 

1429
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,870
okay
why does it work because this is the

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,990

and so therefore i don't once i'm

to external yin yang
displacements okay so for example he's

1638
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
displacements okay so for example he's
 

1639
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,109
displacements okay so for example he's
he's coming in and this is always going

1640
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
he's coming in and this is always going
 

1641
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,150
he's coming in and this is always going
to be

00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,160
to be
 

1643
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,310

a matter of me creating an external yin

1644
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
a matter of me creating an external yin

1646
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
space when i'm operating
 

1647
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,630
space when i'm operating
at an ego tripartite level so he comes

1648
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
at an ego tripartite level so he comes
 

1649
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,030
at an ego tripartite level so he comes
in

1650
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
in
 

1651
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,950
in
and i'm all i've moved out of the way

1652
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
and i'm all i've moved out of the way
 

1653

i've moved out of the way
 

1655
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,910
i've moved out of the way
um and so he he goes again and this

1656
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
um and so he he goes again and this
 

1657
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,230
um and so he he goes again and this
would be the opposite

1658
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
would be the opposite
 

1659
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,710
would be the opposite
i moved into into the weight so people

1660
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
i moved into into the weight so people
 

1661
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,550
i moved into into the weight so people
are going like

1749
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,510

uh this would be are you gonna do it

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
uh this would be are you gonna do it
 

1751

uh this would be are you gonna do it
again

1753
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,030

that would be a young manifestation

1754
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
that would be a young manifestation
 

1755
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,790
that would be a young manifestation
and you can see he's gonna displace me

1756
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
and you can see he's gonna displace me
 

1757
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,710
and you can see he's gonna displace me
because he has more mass and he has the

okay so he goes

1762
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
okay so he goes
 

1763
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,069
okay so he goes
that's not what i'm doing his energy i

that's not what i'm doing his energy i
disappear

1766

disappear
 

1767
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:59,349

of a yin tactic i'm letting him hit me

1778
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
of a yin tactic i'm letting him hit me
 

1779
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,349
of a yin tactic i'm letting him hit me
but

1780
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
but
 

1781
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,390
but
he's not hitting me as if i was young

1782
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
he's not hitting me as if i was young
 

1783
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,510
he's not hitting me as if i was young
as if i was contestant because my body

1784
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
as if i was contestant because my body
 

1785
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,910

1787
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,230
has been organized
outside of the yin yang division okay so

1788
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
outside of the yin yang division okay so
 

1789
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,710
outside of the yin yang division okay so
hence i can do small deflections

1790
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
hence i can do small deflections
 

1791
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,230
hence i can do small deflections
and i'm not he's uh he's pushing he's

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
and i'm not he's uh he's pushing he's
 

1793
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,829
and i'm not he's uh he's pushing he's
i'm not contesting him the same energy

1811
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,109

two aspects of the tetralogy
 

1815
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,270
two aspects of the tetralogy
and my technique can go backwards

1816
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,280
and my technique can go backwards
 

1817
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,270
and my technique can go backwards
or forward or even stay still

1818

or forward or even stay still
 

1819
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,309
or forward or even stay still
you see and so now the whorehouse is the

1820
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
you see and so now the whorehouse is the
 

1821
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,390
you see and so now the whorehouse is the
pure lamp

so we'll do these two techniques i'm

1824
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:22,880
so we'll do these two techniques i'm
 

1825
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,990
so we'll do these two techniques i'm
going this way

1826

instructional manual
 

2043
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,750
instructional manual
then you're going to start doing this

2044

then you're going to start doing this
 

2045
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,349
then you're going to start doing this
kind of thing okay

00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
so um well
 

2049
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,190
so um well
the the universe had to have heavy and

2050
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
the the universe had to have heavy and
 

2051
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,390
the the universe had to have heavy and
light

2052
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:44,400
light
 

2053
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,710
light
so part of it came down and part of it

2054
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
so part of it came down and part of it
 

2055
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,510
so part of it came down and part of it
stayed up

2056
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
stayed up
 

2057
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,109
stayed up
and the part that stayed up we're going

2058
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:49,119
and the part that stayed up we're going
 

2059
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,790
and the part that stayed up we're going
to call heaven and the part that came

2060
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
to call heaven and the part that came
 

2061
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,109
to call heaven and the part that came
down we're going to call earth

2062
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
down we're going to call earth
 

2063
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,030
down we're going to call earth
but you can understand it it's just a

2064
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,040
but you can understand it it's just a
 

2065
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,550
but you can understand it it's just a
split of that void

2066
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
split of that void
 

2067
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,550
split of that void
okay and then uh so here's my heaven

2068
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
okay and then uh so here's my heaven
 

2069
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,030
okay and then uh so here's my heaven
and then here's my earth and then in the

2070
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
and then here's my earth and then in the
 

2071
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,910
and then here's my earth and then in the
middle man

2072
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
middle man
 

2073
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,150
middle man
as i said has that precarious or weird

2074
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
as i said has that precarious or weird
 

2075

00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
uh that you are actually functioning in
 

2079
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,190
uh that you are actually functioning in
between the two

2080
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
between the two
 

2081
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,870
between the two
okay um

2082

2084
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
again you can look at uh buddhist
 

2085
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,630
again you can look at uh buddhist
mythology

2086
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
mythology
 

2087
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,510
mythology
and and if you look at its reincarnation

2088
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
and and if you look at its reincarnation
 

2089
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,150
and and if you look at its reincarnation
models

2090
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
models
 

2091
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,150
models
it was only human beings who be who

2092
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
it was only human beings who be who
 

2093
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,550
it was only human beings who be who
could become buddha

2094
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
could become buddha
 

2095
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,069
could become buddha
you could you could be reborn as a deity

2096
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
you could you could be reborn as a deity
 

2097
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,750
you could you could be reborn as a deity
but and you might think that's better

2098
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
but and you might think that's better
 

2099
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,750
but and you might think that's better
but it's not better because the deity is

2100
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
but it's not better because the deity is
 

2101
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,309
but it's not better because the deity is
still subject to the yin yang rule

2102
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
still subject to the yin yang rule
 

2103
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,470
still subject to the yin yang rule
uh it's better to be a human and reach

2104
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
uh it's better to be a human and reach
 

2105
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,750
uh it's better to be a human and reach
buddhahood because then

2106
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
buddhahood because then
 

2107
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,750
buddhahood because then
then you're one with the dao or one with

2108
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
then you're one with the dao or one with

so many cultures afford this special
 

2113
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,790
so many cultures afford this special
status to human beings

2114
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800

2115
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,510

00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
as you as a modern what i would say is
 

2117
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,470
as you as a modern what i would say is
that

throughout history has played such a

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
throughout history has played such a
 

2135
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,670
throughout history has played such a
prominent role

2136
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
prominent role
 

2137
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,790
prominent role
in religious practices so your breath if

00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:14,800
in religious practices so your breath if

you go to sleep you're not
 

2141
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,950
you go to sleep you're not
conscious your body still breathes but

2142
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
conscious your body still breathes but
 

2143
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,510
conscious your body still breathes but
you can consciously control your breath

2144
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
you can consciously control your breath
 

2145
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,069
you can consciously control your breath
and also consciously you can see that

2146
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,079
and also consciously you can see that
 

2147
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:24,790
and also consciously you can see that
you actually

2148
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
you actually
 

2149
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,109
you actually
interrupt your natural breathing cycle

2150
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
interrupt your natural breathing cycle
 

2151
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,109
interrupt your natural breathing cycle
so through let's say a panic attack

2152
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
so through let's say a panic attack
 

2153
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,470
so through let's say a panic attack
there's nothing functionally

2154
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
there's nothing functionally
 

2155
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,230
there's nothing functionally
mechanically wrong with your lungs

2156
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
mechanically wrong with your lungs
 

2157
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,870
mechanically wrong with your lungs
but you're suffocating right or i ask

and now you can't have the same
 

2163
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,069
and now you can't have the same
breathing pattern

2164
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
breathing pattern
 

2165
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,750
breathing pattern
this one went in at a level 5 value came

2166
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
this one went in at a level 5 value came
 

2167
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,549
this one went in at a level 5 value came
out at level 6 value went in at 2 value

2168
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
out at level 6 value went in at 2 value
 

2169
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,270
out at level 6 value went in at 2 value
this time

2170
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
this time
 

2171
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,670
this time
i got a 10 value coming out you know

as we say you're part of uh uh

2352
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
as we say you're part of uh uh
 

2353
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,790
as we say you're part of uh uh
this weird thing of both of heaven

2354
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:30,800
this weird thing of both of heaven
 

2355
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,270
this weird thing of both of heaven
or the boy or the doubt but not um

2356
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:35,280
or the boy or the doubt but not um
 

2357
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,670
or the boy or the doubt but not um
you start to have like well a circle is

2358
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
you start to have like well a circle is
 

2359
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,630
you start to have like well a circle is
really when

2360
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640
really when
 

2361
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,750
really when
when you take off the corners

2362
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
when you take off the corners
 

2363
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,470
when you take off the corners
and you're gonna have this uh shape like

2364
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,480
and you're gonna have this uh shape like
 

2365
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,950
and you're gonna have this uh shape like
that

2366
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
that
 

2367
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,430
that
and sometimes the entire system is

2368
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
and sometimes the entire system is
 

2369
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,470
and sometimes the entire system is
represented

2370
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
represented
 

2371
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,109
represented
you know and they'll put it all together

2372
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
you know and they'll put it all together
 

2373
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:51,829
you know and they'll put it all together
because

2374
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
because
 

2375
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,470
because
what is this it's just the nature of the

2376
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,480
what is this it's just the nature of the
 

2377
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,190
what is this it's just the nature of the

universe
 

2379
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,710
universe
it's just how it works okay um

2380
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
it's just how it works okay um
 

2381
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,470
it's just how it works okay um
all right i got that i can understand it

2382
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
all right i got that i can understand it
 

2383
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,750
all right i got that i can understand it
geometrically

2384
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
geometrically
 

2385
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,910
geometrically
i got that this is the nature of the

i got that this is the nature of the
 

2387
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,710
i got that this is the nature of the
universe i got that i have some special

or to function at a dow level
 

2395
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,750
or to function at a dow level
i get it but how am i actually

2396
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
i get it but how am i actually
 

2397
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,349
i get it but how am i actually
doing that okay well

2398
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
doing that okay well
 

2399
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,030
doing that okay well
again don't get stuck but

2400
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
again don't get stuck but
 

2401
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,150
again don't get stuck but
heaven is always pushing down

2402
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
heaven is always pushing down
 

2403
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,630
heaven is always pushing down
if i stand in the middle what's it

2404
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
if i stand in the middle what's it
 

2405
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,230
if i stand in the middle what's it
pushing down on

2406
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
pushing down on
 

2407
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,790
pushing down on
it's pushing down on me you see and it

2408
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:34,800
it's pushing down on me you see and it
 

2409
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,829
it's pushing down on me you see and it
pushes down

2410
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
pushes down
 

2411
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,630
pushes down
into the earth okay so heaven is

2412
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,640
into the earth okay so heaven is
 

2413
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,750
into the earth okay so heaven is
invisible

00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
the earth is visible so this
 

2417
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,109
the earth is visible so this
model right here is representing

00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:57,200
i have two options that i can do
 

2425
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,150
i have two options that i can do
i can yin yang it you see so i can

2426
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,160
i can yin yang it you see so i can
 

2427
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,270
i can yin yang it you see so i can
contest it

2428
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
contest it
 

2429
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,549
contest it
or i can get out of the way of it or i

2430
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
or i can get out of the way of it or i
 

2431
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,390
or i can get out of the way of it or i
can

2432
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
can

can
kind of be permeable so that energy

2434
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
kind of be permeable so that energy
 

2435
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,190
kind of be permeable so that energy
comes down

2436
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
comes down
 

2437
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,910
comes down
and goes into the earth do you see and

2438
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:13,920
and goes into the earth do you see and
 

2439
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,230
and goes into the earth do you see and
this

2440
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
this
 

2441
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,430
this
is the natural cycle of the universe

2442
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:17,440
is the natural cycle of the universe
 

2443
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,630
is the natural cycle of the universe
heaven is pressing on earth and earth is

2444
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
heaven is pressing on earth and earth is
 

2445
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,309
heaven is pressing on earth and earth is
holding up heaven

2446
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
holding up heaven
 

2447
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,109
holding up heaven
force is going to come through i don't

2448
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
force is going to come through i don't
 

2449
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,190
force is going to come through i don't
want to get in the way of it because if

2450
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
want to get in the way of it because if
 

2451
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,990
want to get in the way of it because if
i get in the

2452
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
i get in the
 

2453
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,630
i get in the
way of it the ego tripartite manifest

2454
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
way of it the ego tripartite manifest
 

2455
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,349
way of it the ego tripartite manifest
and i enter into a contestation with my

2456
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
and i enter into a contestation with my
 

2457
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,470
and i enter into a contestation with my
partner

2458
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
partner
 

2459
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,069
partner
so i either have to get out of the way

2460
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
so i either have to get out of the way
 

2461
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,069
so i either have to get out of the way
or i have to overpower

2462
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
or i have to overpower
 

2463
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,790
or i have to overpower
instead what i want to do is i want that

2464
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
instead what i want to do is i want that
 

2465
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,430
instead what i want to do is i want that
energy

2466
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440

their force of their punch to pass

2468
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,480
their force of their punch to pass
 

2469
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,510
their force of their punch to pass
through me

2470
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
through me
 

2471
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,790
through me
so when i demonstrated me flexing and

2472
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
so when i demonstrated me flexing and
 

2473
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,069
so when i demonstrated me flexing and
bracing

2474
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
bracing
 

2475
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,829
bracing
you saw the normal physics that you're

2476
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:54,839
you saw the normal physics that you're
 

2477
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,069
you saw the normal physics that you're
understanding

2478
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:56,079
understanding
 

2479
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,589
understanding
his punch displaced me and when i went

2480
00:53:59,589 --> 00:53:59,599
his punch displaced me and when i went
 

2481
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,030
his punch displaced me and when i went
backwards

2482
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
backwards
 

2483
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,069
backwards
but when you saw me become permeable

2484
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
but when you saw me become permeable
 

2485
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,109
but when you saw me become permeable
his force went down into the ground

2486
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
his force went down into the ground
 

2487
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,230
his force went down into the ground
and heaven is pushing back on earth

2488
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,240
and heaven is pushing back on earth
 

2489
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,750
and heaven is pushing back on earth
and so his force invisible heavenly

2490
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:13,760
and so his force invisible heavenly
 

2491
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,950
and so his force invisible heavenly
force

2492
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
force
 

2493
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,910
force
goes through me and comes back out and

2494
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
goes through me and comes back out and
 

2495
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,829
goes through me and comes back out and
you saw him bounce off of me

2496
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
you saw him bounce off of me
 

2497
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,670
you saw him bounce off of me
okay um

2498
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:23,680

 

2499
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,870

this idea tying us more

2500
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
this idea tying us more
 

2501
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,109
this idea tying us more
into aikido

2502
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119

 

2503
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:42,549

is in this practice

2504
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559

 

2505
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,150

okay

2506
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160

 

2507
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,230

so today in aikido because we're

2508
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
so today in aikido because we're
 

2509
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,309
so today in aikido because we're
operating at this level and very few

2510
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
operating at this level and very few
 

2511
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,630
operating at this level and very few
people have this experience anymore this

2512
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:52,640
people have this experience anymore this
 

2513
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,470
people have this experience anymore this
has come to mean something entirely

2514
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
has come to mean something entirely
 

2515
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,150
has come to mean something entirely
different

2516
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
different
 

2517
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,789
different
uh this is some sort of ritual you do

2518
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
uh this is some sort of ritual you do
 

2519
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,030
uh this is some sort of ritual you do
with certain exercises

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,150
and then somehow and strangely
as this tetralemma and this concentric

2524
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,160
as this tetralemma and this concentric
 

2525
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,430
as this tetralemma and this concentric
epistemy is thought to be uh

2526

all gets organized uh and then
so when i do that what is this

2614
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
so when i do that what is this
 

2615
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,710
so when i do that what is this
organization

2616
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
organization
 

2617
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,430

it's the organization that allows the
 

2619
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,309
it's the organization that allows the
energy

2620
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:04,319
energy
 

2621
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,510
energy
to pass through me and go on to the

to pass through me and go on to the
 

2623
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,109
to pass through me and go on to the
other energy so

2624
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
other energy so
 

2625
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,470
other energy so
using this sacred geometry it allows

2626
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
using this sacred geometry it allows

uh uh one is i separate things or
 

2719
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,390
uh uh one is i separate things or
i bring things together that's what the

and to maintain a adhesion okay

2754
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
and to maintain a adhesion okay
 

2755
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,430
and to maintain a adhesion okay
and that's why it is an adhesion i'm

2756
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
and that's why it is an adhesion i'm
 

2757

and that's why it is an adhesion i'm
bringing two things

2758
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
bringing two things

into this togetherness okay uh
 

2761
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,109
into this togetherness okay uh
and just like kishin

2762
00:59:59,109 --> 00:59:59,119
and just like kishin
 

2763
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,150
and just like kishin
is kind of uh passive

2764
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
is kind of uh passive
 

2765
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,349
is kind of uh passive
meaning i don't do it it just happens i

2766
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
meaning i don't do it it just happens i
 

2767
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,870
meaning i don't do it it just happens i
do the organization

2768
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:06,880
do the organization
 

2769
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,510
do the organization
and then the universe does what it does

2770
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
and then the universe does what it does
 

2771
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,430
and then the universe does what it does
the same thing

2772
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
the same thing
 

2773
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,349
the same thing
hokyu and ike are more passive

2774
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
hokyu and ike are more passive
 

2775
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,789
hokyu and ike are more passive
even if i want to assign one

2776
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
even if i want to assign one
 

2777
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,950
even if i want to assign one
and one yang there are more passive

2778
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:20,960
and one yang there are more passive
 

2779
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,230
and one yang there are more passive
things that happen

2780
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
things that happen
 

2781
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,870
things that happen
following the organization of my body

2782
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
following the organization of my body
 

2783
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,910
following the organization of my body
meaning

2784
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
meaning
 

2785
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,109
meaning
he will i will organize myself for his

2786
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:29,119
he will i will organize myself for his
 

2787

energy to pass through me
 

2789
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,069
energy to pass through me
and then he hits a coq uh

2790
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
and then he hits a coq uh
 

2791
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,950
and then he hits a coq uh
hard spot and then he gets projected the

2792
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
hard spot and then he gets projected the
 

2793
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,710
hard spot and then he gets projected the
universe does what it does

2794

01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
or uh he hits uh that energy
 

2797
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,910
or uh he hits uh that energy
passes through me i don't do anything

2798
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
passes through me i don't do anything
 

2799
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,390
passes through me i don't do anything
more and the adhesion starts

2800
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:46,400
more and the adhesion starts
 

2801
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,750
more and the adhesion starts
and that's what you've been seeing is a

2802
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
and that's what you've been seeing is a
 

2803
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,829
and that's what you've been seeing is a
lot of the adhesion so when i

2804
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:49,839
lot of the adhesion so when i
 

2805
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,789
lot of the adhesion so when i
touch him and he gets stuck to me i have

2806
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
touch him and he gets stuck to me i have
 

2807
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,069
touch him and he gets stuck to me i have
organized my body

2808
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
organized my body
 

2809
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,470
organized my body
in a particular way that now he's stuck

2810
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
in a particular way that now he's stuck
 

2811
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,710
in a particular way that now he's stuck
to me when he punched me and he bounced

2812
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
to me when he punched me and he bounced
 

2813
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,430
to me when he punched me and he bounced
off of me

2814
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
off of me
 

2815
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,309
off of me
i organized my body in a particular way

2816
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
i organized my body in a particular way
 

2817
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,190
i organized my body in a particular way
and then

2818
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
and then
 

2819
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,349
and then
he hit the ground and he bounced off

2820
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
he hit the ground and he bounced off
 

2821
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:06,309
he hit the ground and he bounced off
into me

2822
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
into me
 

2823
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,390
into me
the universe separates itself

2824
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
the universe separates itself
 

2825
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,870
the universe separates itself
so let's give uh demonstrations

2826
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
so let's give uh demonstrations
 

2827
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,309
so let's give uh demonstrations
so uh

2828
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319

 

2829
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,829

when i'm doing my art in that

2830
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
when i'm doing my art in that
 

2831
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:26,470
when i'm doing my art in that
sense of king kong kishi

2832
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480

 

2833
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,870

i'm constantly trying to get that

2834
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880
i'm constantly trying to get that
 

2835
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,910
i'm constantly trying to get that
organization

2836
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:29,920
organization
 

2837
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,950
organization
and then i allow those two different

2838
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960
and then i allow those two different
 

2839
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,470
and then i allow those two different
energies to manifest i just become

2840
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
energies to manifest i just become
 

2841
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,109
energies to manifest i just become
concentric with the very workings of the

2842
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119

right and uh i'm doing that thing so i'm
 

2855
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:55,910
right and uh i'm doing that thing so i'm
gonna

2856
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
gonna
 

2857
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,029
gonna
again it's not difficult to see

2858
01:01:59,029 --> 01:01:59,039
again it's not difficult to see
 

2859
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,710
again it's not difficult to see
or hear um because

2860
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
or hear um because
 

2861
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,589
or hear um because
there's other energies at play than the

2862
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
there's other energies at play than the
 

2863
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,029
there's other energies at play than the
external ones

2864
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:07,039
external ones
 

2865
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,190
external ones
and it's just like if i was playing a

2866
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,200
and it's just like if i was playing a
 

2867
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,990
and it's just like if i was playing a
guitar or a wind instrument

2868
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,000
guitar or a wind instrument
 

2869
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,190
guitar or a wind instrument
um if i touch the outside of it

2870
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
um if i touch the outside of it
 

2871
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,510
um if i touch the outside of it
i put another energy and i'm going to

2872
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
i put another energy and i'm going to
 

2873
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,109
i put another energy and i'm going to
change the sound of it

2874
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119
change the sound of it
 

2875
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,510
change the sound of it
and so um same thing happens here

2876
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
and so um same thing happens here
 

2877
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,630
and so um same thing happens here
if you if you pay attention

2878
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
if you if you pay attention
 

2879
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,069
if you if you pay attention
there's more baritone

2880
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:32,079

 

2881
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,069

things like why would he flip over he

2882
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
things like why would he flip over he
 

2883
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,710
things like why would he flip over he
doesn't have a choice he's going forward

2884
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:36,720
doesn't have a choice he's going forward
 

2885
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,230
doesn't have a choice he's going forward
uh and around me he he uh is not turning

2886
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
uh and around me he he uh is not turning
 

2887
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,549
uh and around me he he uh is not turning
on me so do that same one turning

2888
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
on me so do that same one turning
 

2889
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,470
on me so do that same one turning
and he turns the other way and you see

2890
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
and he turns the other way and you see
 

2891
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,870
and he turns the other way and you see
he's not doing that uh so we're just

2892
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:48,880
he's not doing that uh so we're just
 

2893
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,309
he's not doing that uh so we're just
we're now going to go

2894
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
we're now going to go
 

2895
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,589
we're now going to go
in just a ji and the reason for this is

2896
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:53,599
in just a ji and the reason for this is
 

2897
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,390
in just a ji and the reason for this is
um to do a ching pong kishin you're

2898
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
um to do a ching pong kishin you're
 

2899
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,670
um to do a ching pong kishin you're
doing it all the time in kihon laza

2900
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
doing it all the time in kihon laza
 

2901
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,589
doing it all the time in kihon laza
but you ultimately want to do it

2902
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:02,599
but you ultimately want to do it
 

2903
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,870
but you ultimately want to do it
spontaneously like the universe

2904
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
spontaneously like the universe
 

2905
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,910
spontaneously like the universe
functions okay not through form alone

2906
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920

any candy with external movements
it can't be really deep movements
