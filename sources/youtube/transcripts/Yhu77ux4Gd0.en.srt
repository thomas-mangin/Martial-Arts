talking about aikido forms so what is a
 

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,950
talking about aikido forms so what is a
form a form is a collection of

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
form a form is a collection of
 

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,859
form a form is a collection of
techniques in Aikido we unfortunately

12
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:18,869
techniques in Aikido we unfortunately
 

13
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,960
techniques in Aikido we unfortunately
tend to confuse a form and a technique

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:20,970
tend to confuse a form and a technique
 

15
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,700
tend to confuse a form and a technique
and we think they're the same thing but

16
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,710
and we think they're the same thing but
 

17
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,620
and we think they're the same thing but
a technique is an individual piece that

18
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:24,630
a technique is an individual piece that
 

19
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,940
a technique is an individual piece that
you might need to use in conflict

20
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:25,950
you might need to use in conflict
 

21
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,249
you might need to use in conflict
whereas a form is a strategic or

00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:28,259
whereas a form is a strategic or
 

23
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,139
whereas a form is a strategic or
tactical collection of techniques that

24
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:30,149
tactical collection of techniques that
 

25
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,420
tactical collection of techniques that
are answering a specific set of problems

26
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,430
are answering a specific set of problems
 

27
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,180
are answering a specific set of problems
that's arising for a person unlikely

28
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,190
that's arising for a person unlikely
 

29
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,150
that's arising for a person unlikely
that you'll ever use a full proper

Aikido form I've done a lot of sparring

32
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
Aikido form I've done a lot of sparring
 

33
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,430
Aikido form I've done a lot of sparring
with Aikido I've maybe done an actual

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
with Aikido I've maybe done an actual
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,700
with Aikido I've maybe done an actual
form in sparring on maybe two or three

36
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:46,710
form in sparring on maybe two or three
 

37
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,170
form in sparring on maybe two or three
times not very often

38
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,180
times not very often
 

39
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,480
times not very often
however I've used the techniques of iq2

40
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,490
however I've used the techniques of iq2
 

41
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,030
however I've used the techniques of iq2
in sparring tons of times and the reason

42
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,040
in sparring tons of times and the reason
 

43
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,440
in sparring tons of times and the reason
is because the techniques that you find

44
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,450
is because the techniques that you find
 

45
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,090
is because the techniques that you find
in Aikido are the basic techniques that

46
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100
in Aikido are the basic techniques that
 

47
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,130

you find in any other martial art that's
 

49
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,870
you find in any other martial art that's
dealing with the same context that

50
00:00:59,870 --> 00:00:59,880
dealing with the same context that
 

51
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,819
dealing with the same context that
Aikido is dealing with iqs dealing with

52
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:01,829
Aikido is dealing with iqs dealing with
 

53
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,319
Aikido is dealing with iqs dealing with

54
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:03,329
the context where someone has something
 

55
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,240
the context where someone has something
in their hand and they're trying to use

that something in their hand and this is
 

59
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,969
that something in their hand and this is
why there's all these wrist grabs

60
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:07,979
why there's all these wrist grabs

techniques themselves so when we talk

84
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,350

you through that collection techniques
as we go so the first part is the

112
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:10,739
as we go so the first part is the
 

113
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,059
as we go so the first part is the
shomenuchi this alright now this is a

114
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:14,069
shomenuchi this alright now this is a
 

115
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,259
shomenuchi this alright now this is a
little more than the video is going to

116
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:15,269
little more than the video is going to
 

117
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,550
little more than the video is going to
get into I just want to

118
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
get into I just want to
 

119
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
get into I just want to
why that exists because that made me

120
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:17,970
why that exists because that made me
 

121
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,330
why that exists because that made me
look silly to people to go like this but

122
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,340
look silly to people to go like this but
 

123
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,670
look silly to people to go like this but
understand if I had a weapon and I

124
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
understand if I had a weapon and I
 

125
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,830
understand if I had a weapon and I
wanted to attack Josh I would stab him

126
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:24,840
wanted to attack Josh I would stab him
 

127
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,390
wanted to attack Josh I would stab him
like this and that's probably what he

128
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
like this and that's probably what he
 

129
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,890
like this and that's probably what he
would do is bring his arms up even if he

130
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:27,900
would do is bring his arms up even if he
 

131
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,510
would do is bring his arms up even if he
doesn't do that in a grand way right

132
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
doesn't do that in a grand way right
 

133
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,830
doesn't do that in a grand way right
let's say Joshua's gonna stab me with a

134
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
let's say Joshua's gonna stab me with a
 

135
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,380
let's say Joshua's gonna stab me with a
knife and I went ah right okay this is

136
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,390
knife and I went ah right okay this is
 

137
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,059
knife and I went ah right okay this is
normal oh I'm freaking out about stuff

138
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:35,069
normal oh I'm freaking out about stuff
 

139
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,979
normal oh I'm freaking out about stuff
if you look at police reports you'll see

140
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:36,989
if you look at police reports you'll see
 

141
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,589
if you look at police reports you'll see
that victims of stabbings often have

142
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
that victims of stabbings often have
 

143
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,330
that victims of stabbings often have
wounds all along the outside of the arm

144
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,340
wounds all along the outside of the arm
 

145
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,589
wounds all along the outside of the arm
here and that's because they're doing

146
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
here and that's because they're doing
 

147
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,940
here and that's because they're doing
just this they're trying to keep that

148
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:43,950
just this they're trying to keep that
 

149
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,830
just this they're trying to keep that
knife from stabbing them that is the

150
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
knife from stabbing them that is the
 

151
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,630
knife from stabbing them that is the
shomenuchi position so it's a natural

152
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:47,640
shomenuchi position so it's a natural
 

153
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,250
shomenuchi position so it's a natural
defensive position that comes from

154
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,260
defensive position that comes from
 

155
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,050
defensive position that comes from
someone trying to hit you with something

156
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,060
someone trying to hit you with something
 

157
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,449
someone trying to hit you with something
overhead and a knife is a likely reason

158
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:53,459
overhead and a knife is a likely reason
 

159
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,070
overhead and a knife is a likely reason
that someone would do that could also be

160
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
that someone would do that could also be
 

161
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,600
that someone would do that could also be
a stick coming down or whatever right

162
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,610
a stick coming down or whatever right

166
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,420
unlikely that someone's gonna go bulk on
 

167
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,210
unlikely that someone's gonna go bulk on
top of the head like that right but if

168
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
top of the head like that right but if
 

169
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,380
top of the head like that right but if
they have a knife in their hand this is

170
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,390
they have a knife in their hand this is
 

171
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,089
they have a knife in their hand this is
totally a reasonable thrust net right

172
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:05,099
totally a reasonable thrust net right
 

173
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,559
totally a reasonable thrust net right
you see how quick Josh's arm jerk seems

174
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:06,569
you see how quick Josh's arm jerk seems
 

175
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,789
you see how quick Josh's arm jerk seems
like I don't like that all right so

176
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:07,799
like I don't like that all right so
 

177
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,070
like I don't like that all right so
that's the first part is just understand

178
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
that's the first part is just understand
 

179
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,900
that's the first part is just understand
this position exists so that's the first

180
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:11,910
this position exists so that's the first
 

181
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,880
this position exists so that's the first
technique we're learning in this born

182
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:13,890
technique we're learning in this born
 

183
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,820
technique we're learning in this born
the second technique is eqo which is

184
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:16,830
the second technique is eqo which is
 

185
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,979
the second technique is eqo which is
basically elbow control so I come under

186
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:18,989
basically elbow control so I come under
 

187
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,569
basically elbow control so I come under
the elbow here and I'm moving to mom now

188
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:20,579
the elbow here and I'm moving to mom now
 

189
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,880
the elbow here and I'm moving to mom now
if that technique was successful so the

190
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:22,890
if that technique was successful so the
 

191
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,080
if that technique was successful so the
first thing that you see so it would

192
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,090
first thing that you see so it would
 

193
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,810
first thing that you see so it would
look like this and that's shomenuchi

194
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:26,820
look like this and that's shomenuchi
 

195
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,630
look like this and that's shomenuchi
ikkyo mom thing it does not have to

196
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
ikkyo mom thing it does not have to
 

197
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,449
ikkyo mom thing it does not have to
continue into the pin or anything else

198
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,459
continue into the pin or anything else
 

199
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,180
continue into the pin or anything else
right so really simple the the next part

200
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,190
right so really simple the the next part
 

201
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,770
right so really simple the the next part
of this our second technique in this is

202
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:36,780
of this our second technique in this is
 

203
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,180
of this our second technique in this is
simply getting under that elbow and

204
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,190
simply getting under that elbow and
 

205
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,250
simply getting under that elbow and
driving them off now why would this be a

206
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,260
driving them off now why would this be a
 

207
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,020
driving them off now why would this be a
valuable technique well let's look at

208
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,030
valuable technique well let's look at
 

209
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,610
valuable technique well let's look at
the modern approach first right the

210
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:43,620
the modern approach first right the
 

211
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,500
the modern approach first right the
modern approach is this guy tried to

212
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,510
modern approach is this guy tried to
 

213
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,050
modern approach is this guy tried to
stab me with a knife okay I am armed

214
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
stab me with a knife okay I am armed
 

215
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,360
stab me with a knife okay I am armed
otherwise I Drive this guy off of me I

216
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,370
otherwise I Drive this guy off of me I
 

217
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,370
otherwise I Drive this guy off of me I
get to my my weapon and I'm out and on

218
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,380
get to my my weapon and I'm out and on
 

219
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,819
get to my my weapon and I'm out and on
target

220
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:52,829
target
 

221
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,280
target
right so that's why that little bit of

222
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,290
right so that's why that little bit of
 

223
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,080
right so that's why that little bit of
space would saved my life so that's

224
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,090
space would saved my life so that's
 

225
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,180
space would saved my life so that's
super useful for modern law enforcement

226
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,190
super useful for modern law enforcement
 

227
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,430

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,620
super useful and military situations
super useful for the civilian defending

230
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:03,630
super useful for the civilian defending
 

231
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,270
super useful for the civilian defending
themselves at a high level right so

232
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
themselves at a high level right so
 

233
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
themselves at a high level right so
that's a super useful thing to do that

234
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:06,810
that's a super useful thing to do that
 

235
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,390
that's a super useful thing to do that
techniques useful to be able to drive

and then use your weapon also
classically the same thing right so if

242
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:13,139
classically the same thing right so if
 

243
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,259
classically the same thing right so if
I'm a samurai and this samurais cutting

244
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:15,269
I'm a samurai and this samurais cutting
 

245
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,330
I'm a samurai and this samurais cutting
down and I go like this coming under

246
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,340
down and I go like this coming under
 

247
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,620
down and I go like this coming under
here drawing my sword and quickly

248
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,630
here drawing my sword and quickly
 

249
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,390
here drawing my sword and quickly
cutting across that's exactly how it

250
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
cutting across that's exactly how it
 

251
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,440
cutting across that's exactly how it
would have been used back in the day so

252
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,450
would have been used back in the day so
 

253
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,840
would have been used back in the day so
that's what that techniques for it's to

254
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:23,850
that's what that techniques for it's to
 

255
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,060
that's what that techniques for it's to
drive someone off so I can get to my

256
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,070
drive someone off so I can get to my
 

257
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,590
drive someone off so I can get to my
weapon platform or make an escape so

258
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
weapon platform or make an escape so
 

259
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,210
weapon platform or make an escape so
talking about a modern unarmed civilian

260
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,220
talking about a modern unarmed civilian
 

261
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,070
talking about a modern unarmed civilian
and people say like oh you know I'm not

262
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
and people say like oh you know I'm not
 

263
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,480
and people say like oh you know I'm not
armed all the time did if you're not

264
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,490
armed all the time did if you're not
 

265
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,950
armed all the time did if you're not
armed you should just get out of that

266
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
armed you should just get out of that
 

267
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,930
armed you should just get out of that
situation so if I Drive this guy away I

268
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:36,940
situation so if I Drive this guy away I
 

269
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,490
situation so if I Drive this guy away I
want to get out of the situation that's

270
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:38,500
want to get out of the situation that's
 

271
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,410
want to get out of the situation that's
my goal so there's our second technique

272
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,420
my goal so there's our second technique
 

273
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,690
my goal so there's our second technique
alright what's a third technique a third

274
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:42,700
alright what's a third technique a third
 

275
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,430
alright what's a third technique a third
technique in this is the takedown so

276
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,440
technique in this is the takedown so
 

277
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,010
technique in this is the takedown so
after I've gone here if for some reason

278
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,020
after I've gone here if for some reason
 

279
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,650
after I've gone here if for some reason
I need to take him down we're learning a

280
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:49,660
I need to take him down we're learning a
 

281
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,720
I need to take him down we're learning a
series of techniques to break this guy's

282
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:51,730
series of techniques to break this guy's
 

283
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,760
series of techniques to break this guy's
balance now why would that happen all

284
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:53,770
balance now why would that happen all
 

285
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,730
balance now why would that happen all
right let's say he's armed and he comes

286
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:56,740
right let's say he's armed and he comes
 

287
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,360
right let's say he's armed and he comes
down like this and I think well if I

288
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,370
down like this and I think well if I
 

289
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,160
down like this and I think well if I
just shoved this guy off and I don't

290
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,170
just shoved this guy off and I don't
 

291
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,350
just shoved this guy off and I don't
have a superior weapon he might be able

292
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,360
have a superior weapon he might be able
 

293
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,550
have a superior weapon he might be able
to come back at me let's say it's a

294
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,560
to come back at me let's say it's a
 

295
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,930
to come back at me let's say it's a
pretty strong guy and it can get a

296
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:06,940
pretty strong guy and it can get a
 

297
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,610
pretty strong guy and it can get a
little shoved like this but he's still

298
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:08,620
little shoved like this but he's still
 

299
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,260
little shoved like this but he's still
right there right so it's not gonna

300
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,270
right there right so it's not gonna
 

301
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,480
right there right so it's not gonna
settle things for me I maybe need to

302
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,490
settle things for me I maybe need to
 

303
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,100
settle things for me I maybe need to
drive into this guy and get a little

304
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,110
drive into this guy and get a little
 

305
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,980
drive into this guy and get a little
better weapon control or if my kids over

306
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:16,990
better weapon control or if my kids over
 

307
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,330
better weapon control or if my kids over
there and my wife's over there so here's

308
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,340
there and my wife's over there so here's
 

309
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,950
there and my wife's over there so here's
a smallish guy and I think I can handle

310
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:19,960
a smallish guy and I think I can handle
 

311
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,810
a smallish guy and I think I can handle
him my wife and kid are over there I

312
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:21,820
him my wife and kid are over there I
 

313
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,340
him my wife and kid are over there I
don't want to shove this guy over to my

314
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,350
don't want to shove this guy over to my
 

315
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,200
don't want to shove this guy over to my
wife and gear then he stabs them up and

316
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,210
wife and gear then he stabs them up and
 

317
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,790
wife and gear then he stabs them up and
I still go so I want to deal with this

318
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
I still go so I want to deal with this
 

319
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,070
I still go so I want to deal with this
guy so I need to know a way to control

320
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,080
guy so I need to know a way to control
 

321
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,410
guy so I need to know a way to control
this guy from weapon arm position right

322
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:31,420
this guy from weapon arm position right
 

323
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,630
this guy from weapon arm position right
so here I have the left arm control and

324
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:33,640
so here I have the left arm control and
 

325
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,520
so here I have the left arm control and
I can break him down and there's a way

326
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,530
I can break him down and there's a way
 

327
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,720
I can break him down and there's a way
to break them down from here right so

328
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:36,730
to break them down from here right so
 

329
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,640
to break them down from here right so
it's simply pull to the side where he

330
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:38,650
it's simply pull to the side where he
 

331
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,200
it's simply pull to the side where he
doesn't have it on here like this

332
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,210
doesn't have it on here like this
 

333
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,790
doesn't have it on here like this
hopefully that would break his bounces

334
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:41,800
hopefully that would break his bounces
 

335
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,650
hopefully that would break his bounces
hand jumps over there I Drive them back

336
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:43,660
hand jumps over there I Drive them back
 

337
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,270
hand jumps over there I Drive them back
the other way and so that's the

338
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
the other way and so that's the
 

339
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,830
the other way and so that's the
technique we learned to get the takedown

340
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:46,840
technique we learned to get the takedown
 

341
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,020
technique we learned to get the takedown
from this why is that takedown that way

342
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,030
from this why is that takedown that way
 

343
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,670
from this why is that takedown that way
well because if I want to take this guy

344
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:50,680
well because if I want to take this guy
 

345
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,770
well because if I want to take this guy
down and go for his legs you can see

346
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:52,780
down and go for his legs you can see
 

347
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,780
down and go for his legs you can see
that's a real bad option for me right if

348
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:54,790
that's a real bad option for me right if
 

349
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,130
that's a real bad option for me right if
I want to go into some kind of upper

350
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,140
I want to go into some kind of upper
 

351
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,910
I want to go into some kind of upper
body clinch

352
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:56,920
body clinch
 

353
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
body clinch
even if actually sweet guys switch to

354
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,570
even if actually sweet guys switch to
 

355
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,640
even if actually sweet guys switch to
the other side for me just so people can

356
00:05:59,640 --> 00:05:59,650
the other side for me just so people can
 

357
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,560
the other side for me just so people can
see this really easy so let's say I go

358
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,570
see this really easy so let's say I go
 

359
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,210
see this really easy so let's say I go
into some kind of body clinch right here

360
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,220
into some kind of body clinch right here
 

361
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,400
into some kind of body clinch right here
it's still getting cut up right so when

362
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,410
it's still getting cut up right so when
 

363
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,350
it's still getting cut up right so when
I do the takedown for this you have to

364
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
I do the takedown for this you have to
 

365
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,270
I do the takedown for this you have to
have weapon on control so that's what it

366
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
have weapon on control so that's what it
 

367
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,950
have weapon on control so that's what it
teaches us so that's our next technique

368
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
teaches us so that's our next technique
 

369
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,780
teaches us so that's our next technique
in this series teaching its weapon arm

370
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:12,790
in this series teaching its weapon arm
 

371
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,000
in this series teaching its weapon arm
control so we're here like this alright

372
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,010
control so we're here like this alright
 

373
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,100
control so we're here like this alright
now how else might that happen let's say

374
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,110
now how else might that happen let's say
 

375
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,620
now how else might that happen let's say
he's not armed but I'm armed

this guy and he comes over the top now
 

383
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,870
this guy and he comes over the top now
as I go to shove him away he gets a grip

384
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:27,880
as I go to shove him away he gets a grip
 

385
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,550

this guy off trying to shove this guy
 

389
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,280
this guy off trying to shove this guy
off and he's got to hold my weapon hand

390
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,290
off and he's got to hold my weapon hand
 

391
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,360
off and he's got to hold my weapon hand
so I can't use my weapon

392
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,370
so I can't use my weapon
 

393
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,160
so I can't use my weapon
he's right here what am I gonna do I'm

394
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,170
he's right here what am I gonna do I'm
 

395
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,610
he's right here what am I gonna do I'm
gonna try and break and yeah

396
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:36,620
gonna try and break and yeah
 

397
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,939
gonna try and break and yeah
in that same way now from here whether

398
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:39,949
in that same way now from here whether
 

399
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,210
in that same way now from here whether
he's armed or I'm armed we got to get

400
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,220
he's armed or I'm armed we got to get
 

401
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,340
he's armed or I'm armed we got to get
this weapon clear either I'm clearing my

402
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,350
this weapon clear either I'm clearing my
 

403
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,409

armed what am I gonna do them and put
 

407
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,500
armed what am I gonna do them and put
pressure into this so I can get my

408
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,510
pressure into this so I can get my
 

409
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,939
pressure into this so I can get my
weapon free what does this look like

410
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:51,949
weapon free what does this look like
 

411
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,439
weapon free what does this look like
well it looks like a lot of the

412
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,449
well it looks like a lot of the
 

413
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,550
well it looks like a lot of the
techniques you say you and she been

414
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
techniques you say you and she been
 

415
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
techniques you say you and she been
doing except he doesn't often have a

416
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:55,850
doing except he doesn't often have a
 

417
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,670
doing except he doesn't often have a
knife in his hand he's going like this

418
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
knife in his hand he's going like this
 

419
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,189
knife in his hand he's going like this
what do you think this represents well

420
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:00,199
what do you think this represents well
 

421
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,310
what do you think this represents well
maybe this right so from this position

422
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,320
maybe this right so from this position
 

423
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
maybe this right so from this position
I'm trying to clear my my weapon hand

424
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,330
I'm trying to clear my my weapon hand
 

425
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,870
I'm trying to clear my my weapon hand
what if he had the weapon well what am I

426
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:07,880
what if he had the weapon well what am I
 

427
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,520
what if he had the weapon well what am I
doing here I'm trying to drive that

428
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,530
doing here I'm trying to drive that
 

429
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,960
doing here I'm trying to drive that
weapon out of his hand so I can take it

430
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:10,970
weapon out of his hand so I can take it
 

431
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,700
weapon out of his hand so I can take it
away from him so there's our fourth

432
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:12,710
away from him so there's our fourth
 

433
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,620
away from him so there's our fourth
technique I'm trying to take it away now

434
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,630
technique I'm trying to take it away now
 

435
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,420
technique I'm trying to take it away now
if I needed to hang out with this guy

436
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,430
if I needed to hang out with this guy
 

437
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,680
if I needed to hang out with this guy
for a while right so we've got some

438
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:17,690
for a while right so we've got some
 

439
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,629
for a while right so we've got some
serious issues I need to hang out with

440
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:19,639
serious issues I need to hang out with
 

441
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,550
serious issues I need to hang out with
this guy I'm gonna drop my knee here I'm

442
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:21,560
this guy I'm gonna drop my knee here I'm
 

443
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,140
this guy I'm gonna drop my knee here I'm
going to continue into the pin and I'm

444
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,150
going to continue into the pin and I'm
 

445
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,670
going to continue into the pin and I'm
gonna try and get control the situation

446
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:24,680
gonna try and get control the situation
 

447
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,129
gonna try and get control the situation
now that is at the end of this form

448
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:27,139
now that is at the end of this form
 

449
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,439
now that is at the end of this form
which means it's the least likely

450
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:29,449
which means it's the least likely
 

451
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,840
which means it's the least likely
technique we want to do now the problem

452
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,850
technique we want to do now the problem
 

453
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,219
technique we want to do now the problem
is when people see this stuff they go

454
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:33,229
is when people see this stuff they go
 

455
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,350
is when people see this stuff they go
the whole objective of that technique

456
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
the whole objective of that technique
 

457
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
the whole objective of that technique
which is actually a form is to pin the

458
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,250
which is actually a form is to pin the
 

459
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,760
which is actually a form is to pin the
guy it's not true it's simply one

460
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:39,770
guy it's not true it's simply one
 

461
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,379
guy it's not true it's simply one
technique in a progression and if you

462
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:41,389
technique in a progression and if you
 

463
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,180
technique in a progression and if you
look at it it's the one that's failed

464
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,190
look at it it's the one that's failed
 

465
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,350
look at it it's the one that's failed
the most right they jump so when we look

466
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
the most right they jump so when we look
 

467
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
the most right they jump so when we look
at techniques what we need to be able to

468
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,250
at techniques what we need to be able to
 

469
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,159
at techniques what we need to be able to
do is aren't when we look at form see

470
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,169
do is aren't when we look at form see
 

471
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,870
do is aren't when we look at form see
now I'm doing it when we look at forms

472
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:52,880
now I'm doing it when we look at forms
 

473
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,279
now I'm doing it when we look at forms
we need to be able to understand that a

474
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,289
we need to be able to understand that a
 

475
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,320
we need to be able to understand that a
form is a collection of techniques and

476
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,330
form is a collection of techniques and
 

477
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,080
form is a collection of techniques and
not just one huge technique so when

478
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,090
not just one huge technique so when
 

479
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,120
not just one huge technique so when
you're trying to perform one huge

480
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,130
you're trying to perform one huge
 

481
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,279
you're trying to perform one huge
technique it's really hard to understand

482
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:03,289
technique it's really hard to understand
 

483
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,110
technique it's really hard to understand
all the bits in there and to tactically

484
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
all the bits in there and to tactically
 

485
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
all the bits in there and to tactically
understand what Aikido suggesting the

486
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,010
understand what Aikido suggesting the
 

487
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,920
understand what Aikido suggesting the
forms are the absolute least important

488
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:08,930
forms are the absolute least important
 

489
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,900
forms are the absolute least important
thing that we could do and the

490
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:10,910
thing that we could do and the
 

491
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,250
thing that we could do and the
techniques are a little more important

492
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:12,260
techniques are a little more important
 

493
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,170
techniques are a little more important
but the techniques extend to making

494
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,180
but the techniques extend to making
 

495
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,339
but the techniques extend to making
distance and all kinds of other things

496
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:15,349
distance and all kinds of other things
 

497
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:16,870
distance and all kinds of other things
which are actually better ideas but when

498
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:16,880
which are actually better ideas but when
 

499
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,800
which are actually better ideas but when
we get down into it when you'd

500
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:17,810
we get down into it when you'd
 

501
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,270
we get down into it when you'd
understand with all these individual

502
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
understand with all these individual
 

503
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,400
understand with all these individual
pieces so I'm Christopher hind this is a

504
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,410
pieces so I'm Christopher hind this is a
 

505
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,770
pieces so I'm Christopher hind this is a
breakdown of shomenuchi ikkyo or what

506
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:23,780
breakdown of shomenuchi ikkyo or what
 

507
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,020
breakdown of shomenuchi ikkyo or what
there was

508
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,030
there was
