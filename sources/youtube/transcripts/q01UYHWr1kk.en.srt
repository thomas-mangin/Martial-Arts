together and sometimes when we talk

212
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:11,489
together and sometimes when we talk
 

213
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,460
together and sometimes when we talk
about the concept of Mushin we'll talk

214
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,470
about the concept of Mushin we'll talk
 

215
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,009
about the concept of Mushin we'll talk
about the concept of Kokoro nomizu which

216
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:16,019
about the concept of Kokoro nomizu which
 

217
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,800
about the concept of Kokoro nomizu which
means like mind like water right and if

218
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,810
means like mind like water right and if
 

219
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,210
means like mind like water right and if
you think about water if

220
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:21,220
you think about water if
 

221
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,000
you think about water if
if light comes on water it reflects the

222
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,010
if light comes on water it reflects the
 

223
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,560
if light comes on water it reflects the
light back exactly the way it is

224
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,570
light back exactly the way it is
 

225
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,270
light back exactly the way it is
if you pour water into a glass it

226
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
if you pour water into a glass it
 

227
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,370
if you pour water into a glass it
becomes the shape of the glass if you

228
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,380
becomes the shape of the glass if you
 

229
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,320
becomes the shape of the glass if you
run your hands through water water moves

230
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,330
run your hands through water water moves
 

231
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,700
run your hands through water water moves
aside and lets you move your hand

232
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:32,710
aside and lets you move your hand
 

233
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,800
aside and lets you move your hand
through and so when you're you're

234
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:34,810
through and so when you're you're
 

235
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,570
through and so when you're you're
working on your motion you want to have

236
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:36,580
working on your motion you want to have
 

237
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,850
working on your motion you want to have
this this idea of Kokoro nomizu which is

238
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:38,860
this this idea of Kokoro nomizu which is
 

239
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,890
this this idea of Kokoro nomizu which is
your mind's like water it can flow from

240
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:40,900
your mind's like water it can flow from
 

241
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,050
your mind's like water it can flow from
one place to another place and and be

242
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,060
one place to another place and and be
 

243
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,450
one place to another place and and be
okay wherever it is as opposed to you

244
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,460
okay wherever it is as opposed to you
 

245
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,890
okay wherever it is as opposed to you
making judgments about it and being

246
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:46,900
making judgments about it and being
 

247
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,590
making judgments about it and being
critical about it because all that those

248
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
critical about it because all that those
 

249
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,150
critical about it because all that those
problems those judgments you're making

250
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,160
problems those judgments you're making
 

251
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,740
problems those judgments you're making
are just pulling you out of the moment

252
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:52,750
are just pulling you out of the moment
 

253
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,990
are just pulling you out of the moment
and they're taking more processing power

254
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,000
and they're taking more processing power
 

255
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,610
and they're taking more processing power
away from what you need to be doing

256
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:56,620
away from what you need to be doing
 

257
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,430
away from what you need to be doing
which is right in the moment right so in

258
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
which is right in the moment right so in
 

259
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,750
which is right in the moment right so in
the moments not the time to analyze

260
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:00,760
the moments not the time to analyze
 

261
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,610
the moments not the time to analyze
something whether it be good or bad it's

262
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:02,620
something whether it be good or bad it's
 

263
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,590
something whether it be good or bad it's
just the time to let it be and if your

264
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,600
just the time to let it be and if your
 

265
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,180
just the time to let it be and if your
unconscious mind needs help

266
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,190
unconscious mind needs help
 

267
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,010
unconscious mind needs help
your conscious mind can come in and do

268
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,020
your conscious mind can come in and do
 

269
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,290
your conscious mind can come in and do
its job it can't assess something you go

270
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,300
its job it can't assess something you go
 

271
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,090
its job it can't assess something you go
oh that's what I should be doing but it

272
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,100
oh that's what I should be doing but it
 

273
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,530
oh that's what I should be doing but it
but you shouldn't attach to it in a

274
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:13,540
but you shouldn't attach to it in a
 

275
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,240
but you shouldn't attach to it in a
judgmental way that has nothing to do

276
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,250
judgmental way that has nothing to do
 

277
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,160
judgmental way that has nothing to do
with the moment so I think motion is a

278
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,170
with the moment so I think motion is a
 

279
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,340
with the moment so I think motion is a
really tricky concept because it doesn't

280
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,350
really tricky concept because it doesn't
 

281
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,160
really tricky concept because it doesn't
mean that you're completely your

282
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,170
mean that you're completely your
 

283
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,900
mean that you're completely your
conscious mind isn't doing its job

284
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:24,910
conscious mind isn't doing its job
 

285
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,090
conscious mind isn't doing its job
because that's what it does the only way

286
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,100
because that's what it does the only way
 

287
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,200
because that's what it does the only way
to get your conscious mind to shut

288
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,210
to get your conscious mind to shut
 

289
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,750
to get your conscious mind to shut
totally office to be dead and so your

290
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:30,760
totally office to be dead and so your
 

291
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,190
totally office to be dead and so your
conscious mind should be allowed to do

292
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,200
conscious mind should be allowed to do
 

293
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
conscious mind should be allowed to do
what it does but you don't want to have

294
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:33,730
what it does but you don't want to have
 

295
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,630
what it does but you don't want to have
judgments and criticisms and

296
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,640
judgments and criticisms and
 

297
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,740
judgments and criticisms and
congratulations about what's happening

298
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:37,750
congratulations about what's happening
 

299
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,990
congratulations about what's happening
you just want to let it be so this is

300
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
you just want to let it be so this is
 

301
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,540
you just want to let it be so this is
kind of the concept of Mushin and and

302
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:42,550
kind of the concept of Mushin and and
 

303
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,670
kind of the concept of Mushin and and
how it relates to Aikido training we'll

304
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:44,680
how it relates to Aikido training we'll
 

305
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
how it relates to Aikido training we'll
talk about some more of these in some
