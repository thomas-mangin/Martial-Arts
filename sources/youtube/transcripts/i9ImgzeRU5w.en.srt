1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,070

all right uh we're on lift number three

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,080
all right uh we're on lift number three
 

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,190
all right uh we're on lift number three
the back squat so these are the

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,200
the back squat so these are the
 

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,070
the back squat so these are the
progressions for learning it um he's

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
progressions for learning it um he's
 

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,030
progressions for learning it um he's
going to Center himself on the bar very

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,040
going to Center himself on the bar very
 

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,749
going to Center himself on the bar very
much like the shoulder

10
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:14,759
much like the shoulder
 

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,109
much like the shoulder
press and then he is is that tall enough

12
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
press and then he is is that tall enough
 

13
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,390
press and then he is is that tall enough
for you it'll work what okay it'll work

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
for you it'll work what okay it'll work
 

15
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,390
for you it'll work what okay it'll work
all right he's going to go under the

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
all right he's going to go under the
 

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,070
all right he's going to go under the
bar and lay this on what we call the

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,080
bar and lay this on what we call the
 

19
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,069
bar and lay this on what we call the
scapula sh shelf okay so he has his

20
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:33,079
scapula sh shelf okay so he has his
 

21
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,590
scapula sh shelf okay so he has his
scapula and then right on top though

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
scapula and then right on top though
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,389
scapula and then right on top though
there's a kind of Ridge there and that

24
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
there's a kind of Ridge there and that
 

25
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,910
there's a kind of Ridge there and that
is where the bar is uh going to rest so

26
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
is where the bar is uh going to rest so
 

27
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,590
is where the bar is uh going to rest so
don't rest it higher than that and not

28
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
don't rest it higher than that and not
 

29
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,430
don't rest it higher than that and not
lower than that so higher than that go

30
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
lower than that so higher than that go
 

31
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,750
lower than that so higher than that go
ahead and demonstrate he's going to put

32
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:46,760
ahead and demonstrate he's going to put
 

33
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,709
ahead and demonstrate he's going to put
it up on your neck and stuff we don't

34
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
it up on your neck and stuff we don't
 

35
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,950
it up on your neck and stuff we don't
want it there okay you go too low and

36
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
want it there okay you go too low and
 

37
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,670
want it there okay you go too low and
it'll slide down your back which we

38
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
it'll slide down your back which we
 

39
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,150
it'll slide down your back which we
don't want that to happen either so

40
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,160
don't want that to happen either so
 

41
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,069
don't want that to happen either so
right on that scapula shelf and then to

42
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
right on that scapula shelf and then to
 

43
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,790
right on that scapula shelf and then to
help lock it in place uh you're going to

44
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
help lock it in place uh you're going to
 

45
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,389
help lock it in place uh you're going to
lift your elbows up and that kind of

46
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:03,399
lift your elbows up and that kind of
 

47
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,310
lift your elbows up and that kind of
puts pressure on it and it stops it from

48
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
puts pressure on it and it stops it from
 

49
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,510
puts pressure on it and it stops it from
sliding down depending on your

50
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,520
sliding down depending on your
 

51
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,510
sliding down depending on your
flexibility you can do different things

52
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:10,520
flexibility you can do different things
 

53
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,070
flexibility you can do different things
with your hands so you can uh kind of

54
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080
with your hands so you can uh kind of
 

55
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,109
with your hands so you can uh kind of
grab the bar if you want some people can

56
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
grab the bar if you want some people can
 

57
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,990
grab the bar if you want some people can
some people can't and they're kind of

58
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,000
some people can't and they're kind of
 

59
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,190
some people can't and they're kind of
holding it in place you can also put

60
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
holding it in place you can also put
 

61
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,870
holding it in place you can also put
your uh wrist over it uh or anything in

62
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
your uh wrist over it uh or anything in
 

63
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,390
your uh wrist over it uh or anything in
between so this is how Taylor likes to

64
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,400
between so this is how Taylor likes to
 

65
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,069
between so this is how Taylor likes to
keep that bar in place with that

66
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,079
keep that bar in place with that
 

67
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,390
keep that bar in place with that
friction there but key is that the

68
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
friction there but key is that the
 

69
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,230
friction there but key is that the
elbows are more up okay uh once he's in

70
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
elbows are more up okay uh once he's in
 

71
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,670
elbows are more up okay uh once he's in
position he will straighten his knees so

72
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
position he will straighten his knees so
 

73
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,230
position he will straighten his knees so
he's using his uh whole body to get it

74
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
he's using his uh whole body to get it
 

75
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,270
he's using his uh whole body to get it
off he'll take one to two steps back and

76
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,280
off he'll take one to two steps back and
 

77
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,709
off he'll take one to two steps back and
the goal here is not to walk for forever

78
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:44,719
the goal here is not to walk for forever
 

79
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,389
the goal here is not to walk for forever
with that bar cuz eventually it's going

80
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
with that bar cuz eventually it's going
 

81
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,030
with that bar cuz eventually it's going
to be heavy and we don't want to walk

82
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,040
to be heavy and we don't want to walk
 

83
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,270
to be heavy and we don't want to walk
with it we're moving away from the

84
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
with it we're moving away from the
 

85
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,270
with it we're moving away from the
upright just to clear uh the chin up

86
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
upright just to clear uh the chin up
 

87
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,230
upright just to clear uh the chin up
bars or whatever else is with your squat

88
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
bars or whatever else is with your squat
 

89
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,510
bars or whatever else is with your squat
rack okay his feet are going to be be uh

90
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
rack okay his feet are going to be be uh
 

91
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,429
rack okay his feet are going to be be uh
a little wider than his shoulder width

92
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
a little wider than his shoulder width
 

93
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,350
a little wider than his shoulder width
and we would like to see the feet

94
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
and we would like to see the feet
 

95
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,910
and we would like to see the feet
straight okay so you use that mid toe

96
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
straight okay so you use that mid toe
 

97
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,110
straight okay so you use that mid toe
alignment again uh but your flexibility

98
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
alignment again uh but your flexibility
 

99
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,869
alignment again uh but your flexibility
might require you to do something

100
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
might require you to do something
 

101
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,750
might require you to do something
different so I'm going to I know Taylor

102
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
different so I'm going to I know Taylor
 

103
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,790
different so I'm going to I know Taylor
can do it so I'm going to have him

104
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:17,800
can do it so I'm going to have him
 

105
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,270
can do it so I'm going to have him
straighten his right foot out in a

106
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
straighten his right foot out in a
 

107
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,110
straighten his right foot out in a
little more okay and then what you're

108
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
little more okay and then what you're
 

109
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,150
little more okay and then what you're
doing here is the bar's weight is going

110
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
doing here is the bar's weight is going
 

111
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,070
doing here is the bar's weight is going
to be Center entered over that midfoot

112
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
to be Center entered over that midfoot
 

113
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,550
to be Center entered over that midfoot
okay over that midfoot and so you have

114
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
okay over that midfoot and so you have
 

115
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,150
okay over that midfoot and so you have
to find your knee angle pelvic angle and

116
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,160
to find your knee angle pelvic angle and
 

117
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,309
to find your knee angle pelvic angle and
torso tilt to get it there but we want

118
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:41,319
torso tilt to get it there but we want
 

119
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,149
torso tilt to get it there but we want
your torso to be tilted more or less

120
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:44,159
your torso to be tilted more or less
 

121
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,589
your torso to be tilted more or less
nearer the 45 so uh kind of a

122
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
nearer the 45 so uh kind of a
 

123
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,190
nearer the 45 so uh kind of a
conventional wisdom here is that you

124
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
conventional wisdom here is that you
 

125
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,190
conventional wisdom here is that you
imagine lasers are coming out of your

126
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
imagine lasers are coming out of your
 

127
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,990
imagine lasers are coming out of your
nipples and they'll be hit in the ground

128
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
nipples and they'll be hit in the ground
 

129
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,430
nipples and they'll be hit in the ground
at a 45° angle keep your nose and neck

130
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,440
at a 45° angle keep your nose and neck
 

131
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,470
at a 45° angle keep your nose and neck
uh neutral to that line so you don't

132
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
uh neutral to that line so you don't
 

133
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,070
uh neutral to that line so you don't
want to look up can you show you don't

134
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
want to look up can you show you don't
 

135
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,309
want to look up can you show you don't
want to do that okay you keep your nose

136
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
want to do that okay you keep your nose
 

137
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,030
want to do that okay you keep your nose
on that same 45° angle and then what you

138
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,040
on that same 45° angle and then what you
 

139
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,149
on that same 45° angle and then what you
want to do is bring your hips back

140
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
want to do is bring your hips back
 

141
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,949
want to do is bring your hips back
towards the rear as opposed to your

142
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
towards the rear as opposed to your
 

143
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,509
towards the rear as opposed to your
knees forward lowering the bar up and

144
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519
knees forward lowering the bar up and
 

145
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,470
knees forward lowering the bar up and
down on the midfoot line and you want to

146
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
down on the midfoot line and you want to
 

147
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,070
down on the midfoot line and you want to
go all the way down until the bottom of

148
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
go all the way down until the bottom of
 

149
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,270
go all the way down until the bottom of
your legs are parallel to the ground at

150
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,280
your legs are parallel to the ground at
 

151
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,990
your legs are parallel to the ground at
the knee and then you come back up

152
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
the knee and then you come back up
 

153
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,869
the knee and then you come back up
without undoing your torso can and you

154
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:27,879
without undoing your torso can and you
 

155
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,270
without undoing your torso can and you
go back down and you would do that for a

156
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
go back down and you would do that for a
 

157
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,949
go back down and you would do that for a
set of five we don't want to bounce at

158
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
set of five we don't want to bounce at
 

159
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,910
set of five we don't want to bounce at
the end and we don't want to go past

upright with the bar bends his knees and
lowers it on the J Hooks and then he

lowers it on the J Hooks and then he
 

175
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,910

four lift so out of the the back squats

180
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
four lift so out of the the back squats
 

181
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,550
four lift so out of the the back squats
and the dead lifts the back squat is

182
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,560
and the dead lifts the back squat is
 

183
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,869
and the dead lifts the back squat is
generally a safer lift um and so we tend

184
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:07,879
generally a safer lift um and so we tend
 

185
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,869
generally a safer lift um and so we tend
to use it more than the dead lifts

186
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:09,879
to use it more than the dead lifts
 

187
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,670
to use it more than the dead lifts
however the dead lifts I find uh get a

188
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680
however the dead lifts I find uh get a
 

189
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,670
however the dead lifts I find uh get a
little more lat strength going um so

190
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
little more lat strength going um so
 

191
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,310
little more lat strength going um so
sometimes I like to do that but you have

192
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,320
sometimes I like to do that but you have
 

193
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,670
sometimes I like to do that but you have
to be very very uh very very careful

194
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
to be very very uh very very careful
 

195
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,030
to be very very uh very very careful
with these lifts because you're going to

196
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,040
with these lifts because you're going to
 

197
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,469
with these lifts because you're going to
put a lot of weight on them and the rule

198
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:27,479
put a lot of weight on them and the rule
 

199
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,710
put a lot of weight on them and the rule
here is that you only lift to the form

200
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:29,720
here is that you only lift to the form
 

201
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,110
here is that you only lift to the form
form so we're not weightlifters we're

202
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,120
form so we're not weightlifters we're
 

203
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,550
form so we're not weightlifters we're
not keeping track of personal records or

204
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
not keeping track of personal records or
 

205
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,670
not keeping track of personal records or
anything like that and if we can't lift

206
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
anything like that and if we can't lift
 

207
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,189
anything like that and if we can't lift
to the form as you just saw demonstrated

208
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:40,199
to the form as you just saw demonstrated
 

209
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,350
to the form as you just saw demonstrated
we have too much weight on and weight

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
press should you have a catastrophic
 

251
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,590
press should you have a catastrophic
failure you have your spotter there to

252
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600
failure you have your spotter there to
 

253
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,230
failure you have your spotter there to
help keep that bar off of you on the

254
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
help keep that bar off of you on the
 

255
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,909
help keep that bar off of you on the
shoulder press if you have a

256
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:52,919
shoulder press if you have a
 

257
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,150
shoulder press if you have a
catastrophic failure you would just drop

258
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
catastrophic failure you would just drop
 

259
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,029
catastrophic failure you would just drop
the bar in front of you it's easy to do

260
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,039
the bar in front of you it's easy to do
 

261
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,909
the bar in front of you it's easy to do
uh if you could not put it back on on

262
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
uh if you could not put it back on on
 

263
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,670
uh if you could not put it back on on
the J Hooks on the squat you're under

264
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:02,680
the J Hooks on the squat you're under
 

265
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,230
the J Hooks on the squat you're under
the bar and so you have to have a way of

266
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,240
the bar and so you have to have a way of
 

267
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,909
the bar and so you have to have a way of
ditching the bar and here we use a kind

268
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
ditching the bar and here we use a kind
 

269
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,550
ditching the bar and here we use a kind
of Rustler's move so he's going to uh

270
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
of Rustler's move so he's going to uh
 

271
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,070
of Rustler's move so he's going to uh
shrug himself forward and under the bar

272
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
shrug himself forward and under the bar
 

273
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,870
shrug himself forward and under the bar
and Let It Drop behind him if he has a

274
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:15,880
and Let It Drop behind him if he has a
 

275
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,790
and Let It Drop behind him if he has a
catastrophic failure he will not try to

276
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:17,800
catastrophic failure he will not try to
 

277
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,430
catastrophic failure he will not try to
lower it slowly cuz he can't get out

278
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,440
lower it slowly cuz he can't get out
 

279
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,670
lower it slowly cuz he can't get out
from under it so you just ditch the bar

280
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
from under it so you just ditch the bar
 

281
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,189
from under it so you just ditch the bar
and it looks something like this it

282
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:24,199
and it looks something like this it
 

283
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,670
and it looks something like this it
looks exactly like this okay so he's

284
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:26,680
looks exactly like this okay so he's
 

285
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,110
looks exactly like this okay so he's
doing everything we just did and then

286
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
doing everything we just did and then
 

287
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,670
doing everything we just did and then
he's in his form and he

288
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
he's in his form and he
 

289
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,029
he's in his form and he
realizes crap he's going to ditch

290
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
realizes crap he's going to ditch
 

291
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,070
realizes crap he's going to ditch
it and you just let it fall behind you

292
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
it and you just let it fall behind you
 

293
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,950
it and you just let it fall behind you
okay never get yourself under the bar

294
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
okay never get yourself under the bar

when you're ditching it and for this
 

297
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,510
when you're ditching it and for this
reason we have those secondary uprights

298
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,520
reason we have those secondary uprights
 

299
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,070
reason we have those secondary uprights
behind they trap the bar in there uh

300
