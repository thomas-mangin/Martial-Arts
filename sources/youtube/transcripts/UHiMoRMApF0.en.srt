if you when you do that it will speak

326
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
if you when you do that it will speak
 

327
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,550
if you when you do that it will speak
for herself it also works better

328
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,560

 

329
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,590

so if you take this technique you're all

330
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
so if you take this technique you're all
 

331
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,350
so if you take this technique you're all
trying to get this technique but you

332
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
trying to get this technique but you
 

333
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,179
trying to get this technique but you
can't find the complete forfeiting of

334
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:48,189
can't find the complete forfeiting of
 

335
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,809
can't find the complete forfeiting of

00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:51,819
control that allows the arm to actually
 

337
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,790
control that allows the arm to actually
become under your control and I can't

338
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
become under your control and I can't
 

339
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,290
become under your control and I can't
make you right I've seen teachers

340
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,300
make you right I've seen teachers
 

341
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,650
make you right I've seen teachers
including my own go ahead and do it

342
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:04,660
including my own go ahead and do it
 

343
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,509
including my own go ahead and do it
wrong again you've heard me even say

344
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:06,519
wrong again you've heard me even say
 

345
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,540
wrong again you've heard me even say
that to some of you that's a kind of

346
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:09,550
that to some of you that's a kind of

boom wake up but you don't really learn

350
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:16,899
boom wake up but you don't really learn
 

351
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,619
boom wake up but you don't really learn
that way you have to in your own head go

352
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:21,629
that way you have to in your own head go

I'm gonna put Dave on the shelf and I'm

354
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:28,209
I'm gonna put Dave on the shelf and I'm
 

355
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,660
I'm gonna put Dave on the shelf and I'm
gonna try this that's all I'm gonna do

356
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:30,670
gonna try this that's all I'm gonna do
 

357
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:38,830
gonna try this that's all I'm gonna do
I'm gonna let it go by they go by wait

358
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:38,840

 

359
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,060

get it

360
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,070

363
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:02,460

and I I think that my own practice has

364
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,470
and I I think that my own practice has
 

365
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:09,540
and I I think that my own practice has
evolved the more capacity for yen energy

366
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,550
evolved the more capacity for yen energy
 

367
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,179
evolved the more capacity for yen energy

weird because maybe as a deshi you focus

370
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:20,269
weird because maybe as a deshi you focus
 

371
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,739
weird because maybe as a deshi you focus
in on the power you might feel it's

372
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:23,749
in on the power you might feel it's
 

373
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,579
in on the power you might feel it's
attractive it's luring but you what you

attractive it's luring but you what you
 

375
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:34,239
attractive it's luring but you what you
need to focus in is on the void so I'll

376
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:34,249
need to focus in is on the void so I'll
 

377
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:36,939
need to focus in is on the void so I'll

Boyd I think he quit he fight if you
 

383
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,119
Boyd I think he quit he fight if you
ever see a tape you'll see he's not

384
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:46,129
ever see a tape you'll see he's not

part at all and a lot of times he
 

389
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,289
part at all and a lot of times he
stopped the technique he was already

390
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:53,299
stopped the technique he was already
 

391
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,369

starting the next rap but you made his

392
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:57,379
starting the next rap but you made his
 

393
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,150
starting the next rap but you made his
tech technique look weird if he didn't

394
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,160
tech technique look weird if he didn't
 

395
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,919
tech technique look weird if he didn't
know what he was doing I always thought

396
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:02,929
know what he was doing I always thought
 

397
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,710
know what he was doing I always thought
of him as a Nutty Professor

398
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
of him as a Nutty Professor
 

399
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,429
of him as a Nutty Professor
he had a laboratory and we walked in

400
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:09,439
he had a laboratory and we walked in
 

401
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:12,160
he had a laboratory and we walked in
like the wrong class at the University

402
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,170
like the wrong class at the University
 

403
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,169
like the wrong class at the University
and you thought you know is this

404
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:14,179
and you thought you know is this
 

405
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,499
and you thought you know is this
chemistry 101 and and you have this mad

406
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:17,509
chemistry 101 and and you have this mad
 

407
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:21,900
chemistry 101 and and you have this mad
scientist oh yeah and you're like no

408
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:21,910
scientist oh yeah and you're like no
 

409
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,900
scientist oh yeah and you're like no
yes but it's chemistry you know that's

410
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:25,910
yes but it's chemistry you know that's
 

411
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,590
yes but it's chemistry you know that's
what it felt like so you kinda had to

412
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
what it felt like so you kinda had to
 

413
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,359
what it felt like so you kinda had to
imagine that I'm going to learn by

414
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:34,369
imagine that I'm going to learn by
 

415
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:38,169
imagine that I'm going to learn by
watching the scientist because he's not

416
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:38,179
watching the scientist because he's not
 

417
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,720
watching the scientist because he's not
going to do a chapter 1 and a chapter 2

418
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:40,730
going to do a chapter 1 and a chapter 2
 

419
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,119
going to do a chapter 1 and a chapter 2
there's not going to be a preface and

420
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:43,129
there's not going to be a preface and
 

421
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,070
there's not going to be a preface and
there's no bibliography at the

422
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,080
there's no bibliography at the
 

423
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,269
there's no bibliography at the
and he's not going to even grade you so

424
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
and he's not going to even grade you so
 

425
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,030
and he's not going to even grade you so
he would do his techniques this is this

426
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,040
he would do his techniques this is this
 

427
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:20,910
he would do his techniques this is this
is what his and then no one would get it

428
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:20,920
is what his and then no one would get it
 

429
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,000
is what his and then no one would get it
right no one would get it so he's go

430
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,010
right no one would get it so he's go
 

431
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:41,340
right no one would get it so he's go
like this and then no one would get that

the people that really wanted to throw

442
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,090
the people that really wanted to throw
 

443
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,050
the people that really wanted to throw
you know like boom kaboom hated his

444
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,060
you know like boom kaboom hated his
 

445
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,890
you know like boom kaboom hated his
classes because you were gonna do that

446
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:07,900
classes because you were gonna do that
 

447
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:19,380
classes because you were gonna do that
you get it and he said that they can't

448
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,390
you get it and he said that they can't
 

449
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,940
you get it and he said that they can't
really throw it because they can't even

450
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:20,950
really throw it because they can't even
 

451
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,570
really throw it because they can't even
they can't do that so you need to do

452
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:24,580
they can't do that so you need to do
 

453
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,140
they can't do that so you need to do
that so I'm a young deshi and I hear

454
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,150
that so I'm a young deshi and I hear
 

455

masses do and go hey I just want to toss

458
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,200
masses do and go hey I just want to toss
 

459
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,720
masses do and go hey I just want to toss
people around or do I go here's this guy

460
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,730
people around or do I go here's this guy
 

461
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,130
people around or do I go here's this guy
with decades and he's telling me that I

462

with decades and he's telling me that I
 

463
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,420
with decades and he's telling me that I
need to do this to be able to really do

464
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,430
need to do this to be able to really do
 

465
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,210
need to do this to be able to really do
that and he's telling me they can't

467
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,580
that and he's telling me they can't
really do that because they can't do

468
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:56,590
really do that because they can't do
 

469
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:02,370
really do that because they can't do
this so I'm gonna believe him I'm gonna

470
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,380
this so I'm gonna believe him I'm gonna

believe him so I
spent some time with him I went to all

474
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,190
spent some time with him I went to all
 

475
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,290
spent some time with him I went to all
his classes and we did all of that stuff

476
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,300
his classes and we did all of that stuff
 

477
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,140
his classes and we did all of that stuff
barely ever a technique he got really

478
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,150
barely ever a technique he got really
 

479
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,430

659
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,870

that's the that's the void right when

660
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
that's the that's the void right when
 

661
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,090
that's the that's the void right when

knew you can't put your toe in the void
that does not possible the void is you

674
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:36,600

weight don't have a reason just ask that
question and then works work on it don't

726
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,009
question and then works work on it don't
 

727

you just take a step forward in the
 

737
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,600
you just take a step forward in the
right way can you take a step backwards

738
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:35,610
right way can you take a step backwards
 

739
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,180
right way can you take a step backwards
don't 10 con I just want to see if you
