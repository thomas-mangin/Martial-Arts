1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,800
We are on the way to Shikoku once more for a 2-day seminar with Chiba Sensei.

2
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,367
This is of course a Daito-ryu seminar

3
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:29,333
This is our last video for this series.

4
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,000
But we'll probably do some more later on.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,900
We are about 10 people coming from Tokyo

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,700
And there are 30 or so people coming from Osaka. 

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,367
We are meeting them in Osaka and they will drive us down.

8
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:49,667
Daito-ryu is like the etymology of Aikido, like the Latin of the Greek of Aikido.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,700
Most of the Aiki principles of Aikido have disappeared so that is why we are going to Daito-ryu to find them.

10
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,533
This is a very interesting research.

11
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,667
Imitating Aiki is easy, anybody can do it.

12
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:08,500
But to really find the principles by oneself is almost impossible.

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,867
One has to go back to the source to find that.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,467
This is why we go back there regularly and seek these principles.

15
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:20,167
The weather is great today so we are travelling by Shinkansen.

16
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,400
All the conditions are there for a great seminar.

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,667
Guillaume has a new camera so he is very happy to play with this new toy.

18
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:33,833
We are full of energy and spirit.

19
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,667
I hope that you liked the video because we put all our heart in it.

20
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,500
Hopefully it will give you a lot of information.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,667
You are welcome to Japan at any time if you want to experience Daito-ryu.

22
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:50,300
You are welcome, we can take you there.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,067
Thank you for your interest, best regards and see you soon!

24
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:04,433
Every teacher is a truth in himself.

25
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,867
The real question is "How competent was that teacher's own Sensei".

26
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:15,367
Everything stems from that.

27
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:21,900
That is what this scroll represents right? A lineage, a common source?

28
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:27,733
The irony is that it also implies a notion of one being just a puppet.

29
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:38,200
To become the best, one has to become like a branch.

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,833
We seek our original trunk in order to become a stronger branch.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,367
Therefore, you can say that you stem from that particular trunk.

32
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:57,100
The only true question is whether you are a thin or a thick branch.

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,367
The more the branches grow, the better, because then, the nore the trunk growths with them, and as the trunk grows, so do the branches.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:13,333
For me, it is the same problematic.

35
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:17,333
Why am I here before you?

36
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,667
It is for the opposite reason.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,767
I arrived from the bottom,

38
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:29,433
and wondered which of the Sensei I knew was going in the right direction.

39
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:37,967
Three of these teachers seemed to go in one particular direction and by following them inwards, I got to Chiba Sensei.

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,567
What Chiba Sensei shows me now is the opposite view, the one that branches outwards.

41
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:53,433
One has to think about how one can transmit knowledge and become a guide.

42
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:59,467
That is the meaning of the word "Sensei".

43
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:08,800
There are some teachers who do not know how to make the right guidance choice.

44
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,933
When I let them do as they want, I can clearly that.

45
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:19,033
Although what they do works for them, it won't work as well for someone else.

46
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:24,467
If we pay attention to this, we can correct the defects but it requires a lot of good sense.

47
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:28,133
There resides the individuality of each of us.

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,733
As a student, when you start thinking things like: "In spite of my efforts, it doesn't work",

49
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:38,167
a few words with the Sensei can get you unstuck.

50
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:46,700
Just say: "Sensei, I did as you said but it doesn't work, here look..."

51
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:50,533
This is what you should say.

52
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:56,933
You must become Human Beings!

53
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,400
That is the meaning of Deshi, this importance of...

54
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,833
There is a famous Japanese say that goes:

55
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:15,533
"Whatever happens, the first Sensei that one adopts will remain one's Sensei".

56
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:24,833
It means that if you follow a Sensei for a while, it will be very difficult to change, so you'd better not get it wrong.

57
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:30,833
The Sensei should not reprimand the student, he should pay attention.

58
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:38,433
Else, the student will think: "He gets mad at me but I can't do it".

59
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,600
What is this reprimand about then?

60
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:50,233
The Sensei should say: "Look, this is not the right way to do it, you should do it like this instead".

61
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,033
It is easier that way, because he teaches as a fair man.

62
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:59,933
this is the way that one brings knowledge.

63
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:11,833
Of course, there are people who don't get it because they just "can't".

64
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:22,367
This is at that point that the incompetent warrior starts doing impossible things. It can't be helped.

65
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:28,433
Even I, if I was doing something impossible, I would get stuck.

66
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,967
This is what happens when you make things up.

67
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,900
And on the other hand, there are true geniuses.

68
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,400
The best thing to do is to bring the way of the movements to the best of our ability.

69
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,433
This is the true question.

70
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,767
One must grabs his chance and attempt to become a good branch.

71
00:06:49,767 --> 00:07:02,033
The one who comes without this question, with or without an opinion, has to be taught this.

72
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:07,033
This is the role of the teacher.

73
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:14,300
If this takes place, it creates a connection between Human Beings [Ningendoshi].

74
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,500
"Ningen" is written like she "space" between people [or People within their own "space"].

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,200
This is what links them, there is a space between them.

76
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:29,067
If this space wasn't there, it would create conflicts.

77
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,933
There we get the link between the "puppet" and the "human being".

78
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,500
Yes.

79
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:38,700
This space, "Ma" represents the pedestal on which the human being is constructed.

80
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,233
One must open this space, otherwise it gets distended.

81
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,967
If the human being disconnects itself, he becomes part of the "mass" of people.

82
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,800
All of this is pretty well put.

83
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,933
Yes, the Kanji characters...

84
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,633
Today is Sunday

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,933
It is the day of the seminar with Chiba Sensei.

86
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,133
He came in wearing street clothes

87
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,100
and he is going to teach the whole seminar like that.

88
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,667
The reason is that he is ill

89
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:14,967
and that his wife did not want him to go teach, so she refused to give him his keikogi.

90
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,200
Chiba Sensei replied that he would do it anyway!

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:29,633
So since he will do the whole course in street clothes, he decided to show informal techniques,

92
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:35,833
some sort of applications.

93
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,000
It is a pretty funny to do

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,200
even though we are a bit lost because these are rather unusual, mostly secret techniques.

95
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,533
Go to the other side

96
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:56,867
so only his feet can move.

97
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:10,767
If you want to kick, it is easier from this side.

98
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,933
It is there right?

99
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:21,300
This is the kick of Gyaku-Ude-Dori

100
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:26,300
The kick goes like this.

101
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,800
So if the blow comes like this,

102
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,033
You have to do like this

103
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:39,267
Or it can become something like this.

104
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:47,100
It means that we have to take the shortest path, the quickest way.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,467
Remember that!

106
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:59,667
This is how you do a chest grab,

107
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,433
like this,

108
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,033
or like that.

109
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Take the lapel with your index like this.

110
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,367
That's how you grab.

111
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:20,767
Then you can do that!

112
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:24,900
On the throat!

113
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:30,667
This is how you grab in reality, take good note of this.

114
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:34,700
So what do you do against that?

115
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:44,467
When you are held like that, the side that you chose to dodge is crucial.

116
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:49,900
You think you can dodge but that does not prevent my movement.

117
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,900
Go that way, yes, stretch my arm.

118
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:59,433
But I can still come closer.

119
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,433
So you have to come towards me.

120
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:20,233
You have to go that way and this other hand has to act as a guard.

121
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:31,867
After that, Kote-gaeshi, you grab with this one.

122
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,533
What are you doing?

123
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:38,500
You have to grab from here, it's quicker.

124
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:44,033
The other one if for protection.

125
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:48,367
Now try to turn your hips.

126
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:54,433
This is where you have to do it.

127
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:58,967
Oh well, it is still a bit early to show you that isn't it?

128
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,800
I'll explain that to you.

129
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:14,000
Which side would do?

130
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:22,267
The body goes forward so it is dangerous, my own fist can come back at me.

131
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,500
It is the same in boxing, you go forward.

132
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,200
Same in Daito-ryu.

133
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,633
Do you understand?

134
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:36,667
So for Kotegaeshi, it is "Kote ga rachi" [twist/screw the forearm]

135
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:42,167
Why do you hold like this?

136
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:54,167
You have to take the thumb, and then hold firmly.

137
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:58,133
You enter like this right?

138
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,967
You have to grab this way.

139
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,067
How do you disarm?

140
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:31,233
You take it this way.

141
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you understand?

142
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,167
That's it!

143
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:52,800
Before meeting Chiba Sensei, I had practiced the fixed "Kata" form with other Sensei.

144
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:58,400
When I saw Chiba Sensei, I thought that what he was doing was very different.

145
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:03,000
Part of it was Kata but the techniques had more life.

146
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,900
In Aikido, we talk about "Nagare" when the techniques are performed with flow.

147
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:24,500
Therefore, I wondered whether "Nagare" was the ultimate form of Daito-ryu practice?

148
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,667
It is a question of individuality, some people are more or less "agitated".

149
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:35,267
When the partner comes...

150
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:41,500
No, what you must understand is that we used to train in very tight spaces.

151
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,767
You have to think about this.

152
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:50,167
It is very difficult to unbalance the partner when one can't move much.

153
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,267
This is "Aiki".

154
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:58,000
If the partner comes back, one must retake "Ma"; one's distance [Ma-ai]

155
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,933
This is really important.

156
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:09,467
In this situation, when the attacker comes, he only has to take one step, one step and a half max, to be able to grab.

157
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:14,967
It is within that space that he is going to develop his attack and that it is the easiest to "enter".

158
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,200
Therefore, you have to wait for him.

159
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,033
Which guard are you going to take?

160
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:29,133
If one has to say it, the way that you adopt a guard will affect the way he will come, this is human isn't it?

161
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,000
See, if you take a left guard, he will come from the left.

162
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:40,067
He won't come from the front.

163
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:50,233
This is an essential [Gokui], secret [Hiden] point of doing it.

164
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
There is no guard.

165
00:16:54,033 --> 00:17:03,567
The natural position [Shizentai] will come and you will be able to counter.

166
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:27,067
Nowadays, there seems to be an interest on the part of foreigners who come to Japan we have to cater for that need while continuing working.

167
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:34,700
This is why I think that research only is not sufficient.

168
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,533
We saw it clearly during our latest Takumakai gathering.

169
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:52,900
Regarding the propagation of Daito-ryu in future, do you have particular hopes or plans?

170
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,100
This is...

171
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,733
Sorry, it is a strange question...

172
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:02,967
A hope? It is a question of body, just like we said before. 

173
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,600
My hope is that we can unite via training,

174
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:25,600
and that Daito-ryu becomes a medium for encounters, fusion through the heart.

175
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:33,800
This is how we could make it last.

176
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:44,967
I teach 2 seminars per year and people come to absorb through their eyes the techniques of Shikoku

177
00:18:44,967 --> 00:19:00,233
which, once they are integrated, can help grow solid branches to that trunk and help the whole tree to grow.

178
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:03,833
This is what I want.

179
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,867
But first, we have to get out of the current mediocrity,

180
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:11,300
because right now, much of these people think a bit too highly of themselves.

181
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:16,433
Words are part of the folklore, they are just a sort of makeup.

182
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:28,767
Yes, my question was not very good, what i meant was: "What is your hope, not necessarily as a Sensei, but as the Human Being Chiba Tsugutaka?"

183
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:40,900
Until now, Shikoku's Daito-ryu was a bit obscure, which allowed it to keep its specificities,

184
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:47,400
but if it opens up, there is a risk that it loses itself.

185
00:19:47,467 --> 00:20:03,233
So what is your personal opinion about opening Daito-ryu to foreigners and spreading it abroad?

186
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:13,633
For example, you and Guillaume practice with so much dedication and enthusiasm, 

187
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:20,567
that I hope you can manage to promote our approach in France or elsewhere, 

188
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:35,933
to show the techniques to people and help them understand beyond the few pictures that they have seen.

189
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:40,500
It is always better to practice amongst human Beings.

190
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,833
Because we need both to integrate ourselves and reach out to others.

191
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:49,800
I think that we covered pretty much everything right?

192
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,767
Yes Sensei, thank you very much!

193
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,867
Perhaps I have not been clear enough on some things?

194
00:20:55,867 --> 00:21:01,267
It is going to take us some time to sort all of that out, perhaps a month.

195
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:04,300
I don't mind if it takes time.
