1
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,990

see your right hand is trying to stop

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,000
see your right hand is trying to stop
 

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,669
see your right hand is trying to stop
him right do you see

4
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:26,679

 

5
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,950

that stopping

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
that stopping
 

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,990
that stopping
stopping

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000

 

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,470

So eventually he's going to get through

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
So eventually he's going to get through
 

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,229
So eventually he's going to get through
like

12
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:37,239

 

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,869

that so as I

14
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:39,879
that so as I
 

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,470
that so as I
said if if I have to stop him and he

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,480
said if if I have to stop him and he
 

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,029
said if if I have to stop him and he
wants to come

18
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
wants to come
 

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,229
wants to come
forward so rather than stop him is as

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,239
forward so rather than stop him is as
 

21
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,349
forward so rather than stop him is as
he's pushing that angle you take him to

22
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:52,359
he's pushing that angle you take him to
 

23
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,110
he's pushing that angle you take him to
the

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120

 

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,229

Tilt not here but take it into the tilt

26
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239

 

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,030

just an easy one is just take it into a

28
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
just an easy one is just take it into a
 

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,390
just an easy one is just take it into a
tilt you can do different things with

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,400
tilt you can do different things with
 

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,469
tilt you can do different things with
his hand you see so he's in a tilt he'll

32
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
his hand you see so he's in a tilt he'll
 

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,830
his hand you see so he's in a tilt he'll
respond to it into the other

34
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840

 

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,590

tilt you pushes

36
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600

 

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,950

tilt pushes

38
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
tilt pushes
 

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,350
tilt pushes
tilt pushes tilt

40
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360

 

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,910

not here eventually he's going to get

42
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
not here eventually he's going to get
 

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,670
not here eventually he's going to get
me he pushes tilts

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680

 

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,830

tilt so if you look at this hand I came

46
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,840
tilt so if you look at this hand I came
 

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,749
tilt so if you look at this hand I came
around this way he went around the

48
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:46,759
around this way he went around the
 

49
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,350
around this way he went around the
outside and then I just stayed on the

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
outside and then I just stayed on the
 

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,230
outside and then I just stayed on the
inside but the difference was that as he

52
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
inside but the difference was that as he
 

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,389
inside but the difference was that as he
did that this hand I brought into the

54
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
did that this hand I brought into the
 

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,389
did that this hand I brought into the
Tilt do you see and then I can use this

56
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:57,399
Tilt do you see and then I can use this
 

57
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,830
Tilt do you see and then I can use this
hand

58
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
hand
 

59
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,630
hand
now

60
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
now
 

61
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,230
now
so again he was

62
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
so again he was
 

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,229
so again he was
pushing so I just pushed that hand there

64
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
pushing so I just pushed that hand there
 

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,830
pushing so I just pushed that hand there
this hand attempted to counter I stay on

66
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:10,840
this hand attempted to counter I stay on
 

67
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,030
this hand attempted to counter I stay on
the inside out it

68
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
the inside out it
 

69
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,509
the inside out it
goes so if you look he push I just went

70
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
goes so if you look he push I just went
 

71
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,750
goes so if you look he push I just went
and took it in but it's kind of stuck do

72
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
and took it in but it's kind of stuck do
 

73
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,070
and took it in but it's kind of stuck do
you feel it it's kind of stuck are you

74
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
you feel it it's kind of stuck are you
 

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,110
you feel it it's kind of stuck are you
pushing push it gets

76
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
pushing push it gets
 

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,350
pushing push it gets
stuck on the other one right I'm trying

78
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
stuck on the other one right I'm trying
 

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,270
stuck on the other one right I'm trying
to take take it he goes around the

80
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
to take take it he goes around the
 

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,509
to take take it he goes around the
outside I don't care I'll figure it out

82
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
outside I don't care I'll figure it out
 

83
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,190
outside I don't care I'll figure it out
it doesn't matter if you change it okay

84
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
it doesn't matter if you change it okay
 

85
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,030
it doesn't matter if you change it okay
so this time he went around this way I'd

86
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
so this time he went around this way I'd
 

87
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,309
so this time he went around this way I'd
come around this

88
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:39,319
come around this
 

89
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,390
come around this
way

90
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,400
way
 

91
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,550
way
pushing I'm on the

92
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
pushing I'm on the
 

93
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,149
pushing I'm on the
inside so I came this way he went around

94
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
inside so I came this way he went around
 

95
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,990
inside so I came this way he went around
the outside I stayed on the inside okay

96
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,000
the outside I stayed on the inside okay
 

97
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,270
the outside I stayed on the inside okay
do you feel the same

98
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,280

 

99
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,509

friction so again but not here so let's

100
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,519
friction so again but not here so let's
 

101
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,190
friction so again but not here so let's
look at it he is coming around I'm here

102
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
look at it he is coming around I'm here
 

103
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,390
look at it he is coming around I'm here
so let's look at that little circle

104
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,400
so let's look at that little circle
 

105
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,830
so let's look at that little circle
there's my heeld but it's taking him

106
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
there's my heeld but it's taking him
 

107
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,390
there's my heeld but it's taking him
into that tilt do you see and once you

108
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
into that tilt do you see and once you
 

109
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,750
into that tilt do you see and once you
have one part of the Tilt here's where

110
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:10,760
have one part of the Tilt here's where
 

111
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,990
have one part of the Tilt here's where
the C on the x pattern

112
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000

 

113
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,309

works now imagine I did that same one I

114
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
works now imagine I did that same one I
 

115
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,630
works now imagine I did that same one I
I'll figure it I don't know if I'm doing

116
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:19,640
I'll figure it I don't know if I'm doing
 

117
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,229
I'll figure it I don't know if I'm doing
the same thing here but I don't do this

118
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
the same thing here but I don't do this
 

119
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,430
the same thing here but I don't do this
hand into the tail I don't yield on this

120
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
hand into the tail I don't yield on this
 

121
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,990
hand into the tail I don't yield on this
I hold him up and he's trying to go

122
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
I hold him up and he's trying to go
 

123
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,830
I hold him up and he's trying to go
around this hand you're trying to go

124
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:28,840
around this hand you're trying to go
 

125
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,750
around this hand you're trying to go
around this hand you're pushing on this

126
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:30,760
around this hand you're pushing on this
 

127
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,990
around this hand you're pushing on this
hand I'm holding you there look he goes

128
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
hand I'm holding you there look he goes
 

129
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,830
hand I'm holding you there look he goes
around this hand it won't be the same

130
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
around this hand it won't be the same
 

131
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,309
around this hand it won't be the same
thing you see that it will not be the

132
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319
thing you see that it will not be the
 

133
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,309
thing you see that it will not be the
same thing it's this part that made it

134
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
same thing it's this part that made it
 

135
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,630
same thing it's this part that made it
work okay so again as he goes I don't

136
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
work okay so again as he goes I don't
 

137
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,229
work okay so again as he goes I don't
push I don't stop him where does he want

138
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
push I don't stop him where does he want
 

139
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,429
push I don't stop him where does he want
to go I can feel him you see I can feel

140
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:52,439
to go I can feel him you see I can feel
 

141
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,229
to go I can feel him you see I can feel
him go that way so I let him go that way

142
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:55,239
him go that way so I let him go that way
 

143
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,670
him go that way so I let him go that way
it's letting him go that

144
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
it's letting him go that
 

145
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,069
it's letting him go that
way

146
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079

 

147
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,589

I don't know why you put yourself in a

148
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
I don't know why you put yourself in a
 

149
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,589
I don't know why you put yourself in a
wrist Lo but

150
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:10,599

 

151
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,270

okay no tilt you see same thing

152
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280

 

153
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,789

tilt okay so you got to get that tilt

154
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
tilt okay so you got to get that tilt
 

155
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,430
tilt okay so you got to get that tilt
can't be S sitting up right heats up

156
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
can't be S sitting up right heats up
 

157
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,909
can't be S sitting up right heats up
right you're kind of just moving his

158
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
right you're kind of just moving his
 

159
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,590
right you're kind of just moving his
arms around okay try it

160
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
arms around okay try it
 

161
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,990
arms around okay try it
again

162
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,000

 

163
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,189

why do you think he's floating like that

164
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
why do you think he's floating like that
 

165
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,909
why do you think he's floating like that
because I'm holding him up S what

166
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:36,919
because I'm holding him up S what

00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:17,479
external yield but you have to be your
 

223
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,629
external yield but you have to be your
yield remember has to be in the center

224
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:19,639
yield remember has to be in the center
 

225
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,150

he push his anle like that not just
 

229
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,350
he push his anle like that not just
getting out of the way I immediately

230
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,360
getting out of the way I immediately
 

231
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,469
getting out of the way I immediately
touch his Center so when he

232
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
touch his Center so when he
 

233
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,230
touch his Center so when he
counters he can keep touching his Center

234
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
counters he can keep touching his Center
 

235
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,870
counters he can keep touching his Center
okay so touch his Center then it'll

236
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
okay so touch his Center then it'll
 

237
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,950
okay so touch his Center then it'll
work just here won't work cuz he starts

238
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:41,960
work just here won't work cuz he starts
 

239
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,510
work just here won't work cuz he starts

leaning on you which is what you want
 

241
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,589
leaning on you which is what you want
because that makes his Center but if

242
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:47,599
because that makes his Center but if
 

243
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,469
because that makes his Center but if
you're external he's leaning on you is

244
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
you're external he's leaning on you is
 

245
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,990
you're external he's leaning on you is
actually going to push push on you

246
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,000
actually going to push push on you
 

247
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,670

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,000
then he starts using me for balence and
 

253
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,350
then he starts using me for balence and

259
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,469
don't I don't my goal is not to
overpower him so I wouldn't want to push

260
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
overpower him so I wouldn't want to push
 

261
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,150
overpower him so I wouldn't want to push
him out of his

262
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
him out of his
 

263
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,189
him out of his
fall so when he's totally leaning on you

264
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
fall so when he's totally leaning on you
 

265
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,950
fall so when he's totally leaning on you
he's falling you just take away the

266
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
he's falling you just take away the
 

267
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,589
he's falling you just take away the
handrail and they'll fall

268
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
handrail and they'll fall
 

269
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,270
handrail and they'll fall
okay so same thing there's the push

270
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,280
okay so same thing there's the push
 

271
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:46,270
okay so same thing there's the push
there's the center

272
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,280

 

273
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,510

always in the center you see that never

274
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:48,520
always in the center you see that never
 

275
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,830
always in the center you see that never
out on his arms never out on his arms

276
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,840
out on his arms never out on his arms
 

277
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,510
out on his arms never out on his arms
and then I pull the arm and eventually

278
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:52,520
and then I pull the arm and eventually
 

279
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,510
and then I pull the arm and eventually
the shoulder and then eventually the

280
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,520
the shoulder and then eventually the
 

281
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,950
the shoulder and then eventually the
center that's not it always in the

282
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:57,960
center that's not it always in the
 

283
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,869
center that's not it always in the
center always

284
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
center always
 

285
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,909
center always
in the

286
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:06,919

 

287
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:16,390

center okay let's try it

288
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400

 

289
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,670

again do try to do that one again I want

290
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
again do try to do that one again I want
 

291
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,230
again do try to do that one again I want
you to show what I want to talk about

292
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
you to show what I want to talk about
 

293
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,350
you to show what I want to talk about
what's happening so get the elbow okay

294
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,360
what's happening so get the elbow okay
 

295
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,990
what's happening so get the elbow okay
now you feel his center right do you

296
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
now you feel his center right do you
 

297
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,029
now you feel his center right do you
okay we push to it okay there you go and

298
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
okay we push to it okay there you go and
 

299
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,149
okay we push to it okay there you go and
now what you do is you've picked the

300
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:33,159
now what you do is you've picked the
 

301
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,949
now what you do is you've picked the
angle and the throw that you want right

302
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:35,959
angle and the throw that you want right
 

303
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,110
angle and the throw that you want right
do you get that but he's kind of leaning

304
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,120
do you get that but he's kind of leaning
 

305
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,149
do you get that but he's kind of leaning
forward do you see that and as he

306
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
forward do you see that and as he
 

307
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,990
forward do you see that and as he
resists and tries to keep his balance go

308
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,000
resists and tries to keep his balance go
 

309
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,269
resists and tries to keep his balance go
ahead that's when you just outow him do

310
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:46,279
ahead that's when you just outow him do
 

311
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,590
ahead that's when you just outow him do
you understand that but why are we outp

312
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,600
you understand that but why are we outp
 

313
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,509
you understand that but why are we outp
powering what did I say you were

314
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
powering what did I say you were
 

315
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,310
powering what did I say you were
doing I don't know you had you had the

316
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
doing I don't know you had you had the
 

317
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,230
doing I don't know you had you had the
you already had the throw planned you

318
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
you already had the throw planned you
 

319
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,670
you already had the throw planned you
already see the throw in your head do

320
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:58,680
already see the throw in your head do
 

321
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,310

then you could have someone I guess

460
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
then you could have someone I guess
 

461
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,350
then you could have someone I guess
who's like driving and you get out of

who's like driving and you get out of
 

463
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,509
who's like driving and you get out of
the way do you see then I fall into it I

464
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
the way do you see then I fall into it I
 

465
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,750
the way do you see then I fall into it I
guess okay but it's probably not going

466
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
guess okay but it's probably not going
 

467
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,870
guess okay but it's probably not going
to be Tristan okay um so that's where

468
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:53,880
to be Tristan okay um so that's where
 

469
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,949
to be Tristan okay um so that's where
that adhesion is going to come in okay

470
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
that adhesion is going to come in okay
 

471
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,629
that adhesion is going to come in okay
because I need the friction I need the

472
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
because I need the friction I need the
 

473
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,550
because I need the friction I need the
the the stuckness okay so as you're

474
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
the the stuckness okay so as you're
 

475
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,189
the the stuckness okay so as you're
trying to touch me uh I am sticky do you

476
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:10,199
trying to touch me uh I am sticky do you
 

477
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,069
trying to touch me uh I am sticky do you
see sticky and so uh I with the

see sticky and so uh I with the
 

479
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,030
see sticky and so uh I with the
stickiness then the person who's maybe

480
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,040
stickiness then the person who's maybe
 

481
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,230
stickiness then the person who's maybe
I'm holding up do you see or the person

482
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,240
I'm holding up do you see or the person
 

483
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,629
I'm holding up do you see or the person
who's not going to give that much
