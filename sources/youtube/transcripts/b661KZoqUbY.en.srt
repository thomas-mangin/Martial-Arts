484
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:06,179
external okay so you're gonna get here
 

485
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,630
external okay so you're gonna get here
and here's where you feel the weight

486

and here's where you feel the weight
 

487
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,549
and here's where you feel the weight
you don't see that don't move the

488
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
you don't see that don't move the
 

489
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,590
you don't see that don't move the
problem somewhere else it's not going to

490
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,600
problem somewhere else it's not going to
 

491
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,029
problem somewhere else it's not going to
change

492
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,039
change
 

493
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,430
change
you could you could continue to tank on

494
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:16,440
you could you could continue to tank on
 

495
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,230
you could you could continue to tank on
but you have to change the problem

496
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
but you have to change the problem
 

497
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,390
but you have to change the problem
Okay so

498
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
Okay so
 

499
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,430
Okay so
my gross external

500
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,440
my gross external
 

501
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,510
my gross external
is as opposed to doing it on my

502
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,520
is as opposed to doing it on my
 

503
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,990
is as opposed to doing it on my
legs in place I'm going to actually step

504
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
legs in place I'm going to actually step
 

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,990

okay
 

529
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,630
okay
gonna generate the problem

530
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
gonna generate the problem
 

531
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,590
gonna generate the problem
boom there it is and now we're all all

532
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
boom there it is and now we're all all
 

533
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,810
boom there it is and now we're all all
of us will make that big pattern

534
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:02,820
of us will make that big pattern
 

535
