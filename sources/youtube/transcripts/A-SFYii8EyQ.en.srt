as you take that extra little step that
 

183
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,550
as you take that extra little step that
usually makes their back foot do this

184
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
usually makes their back foot do this
 

185
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,270
usually makes their back foot do this
if

186
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
if
 

187
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,350
if
if they only do that you haven't got it

188
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
if they only do that you haven't got it
 

189
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,469
if they only do that you haven't got it
correct

190
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
correct
 

191
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,430
correct
okay so they're holding

192
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
okay so they're holding
 

193
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,030
okay so they're holding
and all of a sudden it

194
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
and all of a sudden it
 

195
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,469
and all of a sudden it
it makes that happen

196
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
it makes that happen
 

197
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,150
it makes that happen
so

198
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
so
 

199
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,550
so
down there

200
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560

 

201
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,670

about here you're gonna as you do that

202
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
about here you're gonna as you do that
 

203
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,870
about here you're gonna as you do that
that's when you hear that back foot move

204
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880

 

205
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,070

boom

206
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080

boom
that's when you hear that back foot move

208
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
that's when you hear that back foot move
 

209
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,870
that's when you hear that back foot move
that last

210
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
that last
 

211
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:17,510
that last
that last piece

212
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520

 

213
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,230

if their back foot moved

214
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
if their back foot moved
 

215
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,950
if their back foot moved
it needs to move or as you can't do the

216
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
it needs to move or as you can't do the
 

217
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,029
it needs to move or as you can't do the
miroti dory throw

218
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
miroti dory throw
 

219
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,749
miroti dory throw
if their back foot's in the way

220
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
if their back foot's in the way
 

221
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,590
if their back foot's in the way
you can't get behind them because they

222
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
you can't get behind them because they
 

223
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,990
you can't get behind them because they
didn't move they're in your way

224
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
didn't move they're in your way
 

225
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,790
didn't move they're in your way
so

226
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
so
 

227
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,710
so
so you've done that

228
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
so you've done that
 

229
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,550
so you've done that
they're in your way you would never be

230
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
they're in your way you would never be
 

231
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:48,710
they're in your way you would never be
able to throw them with all of this

232
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720

 

233
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,710

their back foot moves that means their

234
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
their back foot moves that means their
 

235
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,390
their back foot moves that means their
angle their body moves

236
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
angle their body moves
 

237
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,070
angle their body moves
the angle now

238
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
the angle now
 

239
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,909
the angle now
is if i

240
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
is if i
 

241
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,550
is if i
had the joe

242
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
had the joe
 

243
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,189
had the joe
that they're the angle of the joe and

244
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
that they're the angle of the joe and
 

245
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,469
that they're the angle of the joe and
i'm the angle of the joe so i now

246
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
i'm the angle of the joe so i now
 

247
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,270
i'm the angle of the joe so i now
step in the angle of the joe

248
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
step in the angle of the joe
 

249
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,270
step in the angle of the joe
i bring this up

250
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
i bring this up

281
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,309
i'm at the angle of the joe the distance
is the same

282
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319

 

283
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,749

okay do you notice how this
 

315
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,990
okay do you notice how this
rolls over

316
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
rolls over
 

317
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,749
rolls over
rolls over

318
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
rolls over
 

319
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:29,909
rolls over
rolls over but i was over

320
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919

 

321
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,070

well of course it's all one it's not

322
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
well of course it's all one it's not
 

323
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,469
well of course it's all one it's not
staggered like that this is for your

324
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
staggered like that this is for your
 

325
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,430
staggered like that this is for your
one-to-one personal practice like i'm

326
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
one-to-one personal practice like i'm
 

327
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:48,150
one-to-one personal practice like i'm
doing here

328
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160

 

329
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,910

dynamic

330
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
dynamic
 

331
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,070
dynamic
dynamic

332
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
dynamic
 

333
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,710
dynamic
they should fall in an exact

334
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
they should fall in an exact
 

335
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,550
they should fall in an exact
line this way

336
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
line this way
 

337
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,350
line this way
so

338
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
so
 

339
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,509
so
if my body was a

340
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519

 

341
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,030

if my body was a straight joe

342
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040

 

343
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,790

they would be the t

344
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
they would be the t
 

345
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
they would be the t
they would

346
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
they would
 

347
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,829
they would
they would be on top of the

348
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
they would be on top of the
 

349
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,350
they would be on top of the
straight joe

350
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
straight joe
 

351
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,509
straight joe
that would be a t angle

352
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
that would be a t angle
 

353
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,269
that would be a t angle
if they fall

354
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
if they fall
 

355
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,269
if they fall
to the side

356
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
to the side
 

357
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,750
to the side
like that it means i use too much

358
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
like that it means i use too much
 

359
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,670
like that it means i use too much
shoulders

360
