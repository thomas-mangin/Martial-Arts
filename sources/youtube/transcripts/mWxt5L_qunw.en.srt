1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,429

okay so the eight count

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
okay so the eight count
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,470
okay so the eight count
just some summary points it goes into

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
just some summary points it goes into
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,430
just some summary points it goes into
pairs they're kind of yin-yang pairs

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
pairs they're kind of yin-yang pairs
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,870
pairs they're kind of yin-yang pairs
um that's one point to remember so

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
um that's one point to remember so
 

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,269
um that's one point to remember so
on the first set one you step back

10
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
on the first set one you step back
 

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,550
on the first set one you step back
second set two you step forward

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
second set two you step forward
 

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,910
second set two you step forward
okay so that's a pair uh three are your

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
okay so that's a pair uh three are your
 

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,109
okay so that's a pair uh three are your
ten con

16
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
ten con
 

17
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,790
ten con
so you have your standard tan khan

18
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
so you have your standard tan khan
 

19
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,950
so you have your standard tan khan
and you have your ishido tank on three

20
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
and you have your ishido tank on three
 

21
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,910
and you have your ishido tank on three
and four

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
and four
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,110
and four
and then five you have this side step

24
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
and then five you have this side step
 

25
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,110
and then five you have this side step
one uh where you're moving towards

26
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
one uh where you're moving towards
 

27
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,830
one uh where you're moving towards
and six is the pair to five

28
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
and six is the pair to five
 

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,590
and six is the pair to five
is in essence you're going to do that

30
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
is in essence you're going to do that
 

31
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,190
is in essence you're going to do that
but to the side so you're moving away

32
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
but to the side so you're moving away
 

33
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,389
but to the side so you're moving away
okay so the guys over there

34
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
okay so the guys over there
 

35
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,830
okay so the guys over there
won't pop and then you repeat the form

36
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
won't pop and then you repeat the form
 

37
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,940
won't pop and then you repeat the form
guys over there who

38
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:01,950

 

39
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:11,030

[Music]

40
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040

 

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,390

some things to remember in the entire

42
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
some things to remember in the entire
 

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,190
some things to remember in the entire
set

44
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200

 

45
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,310

this is my opinion the footwork gets

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
this is my opinion the footwork gets
 

47
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,910
this is my opinion the footwork gets
redundant so

48
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
redundant so
 

49
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,230
redundant so
by the end here six

50
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
by the end here six
 

51
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,109
by the end here six
seven you're doing you gave me ten con

52
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
seven you're doing you gave me ten con
 

53
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,590
seven you're doing you gave me ten con
it's not really a new footwork

54
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
it's not really a new footwork
 

55
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,830
it's not really a new footwork
um and remember that the footwork is

56
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
um and remember that the footwork is
 

57
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,190
um and remember that the footwork is
really

58
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
really
 

59
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,630
really
goes back to just the basic yin yang

60
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
goes back to just the basic yin yang
 

61
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,149
goes back to just the basic yin yang
footwork

62
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
footwork
 

63
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,789
footwork
where i will either do a straight line

64
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
where i will either do a straight line
 

65
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,149
where i will either do a straight line
or a turn

66
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
or a turn
 

67
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,710
or a turn
and i do the same thing for both so my

68
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
and i do the same thing for both so my
 

69
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,149
and i do the same thing for both so my
knee will go

70
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
knee will go
 

71
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,270
knee will go
to the in phase which is knee to toes

72
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
to the in phase which is knee to toes
 

73
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,709
to the in phase which is knee to toes
that creates a forward angled ground

74
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
that creates a forward angled ground
 

75
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,510
that creates a forward angled ground
vector

76
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
vector
 

77
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,069
vector
which allows me to move the other foot

78
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
which allows me to move the other foot
 

79
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,149
which allows me to move the other foot
but it's also the same thing that allows

80
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
but it's also the same thing that allows
 

81
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,709
but it's also the same thing that allows
me to establish a single pivot point

82
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
me to establish a single pivot point
 

83
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,190
me to establish a single pivot point
which allows me to turn without being

84
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
which allows me to turn without being
 

85
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,949
which allows me to turn without being
double weighted

86
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
double weighted
 

87
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,070
double weighted
okay so in that sense

88
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
okay so in that sense
 

89
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,830
okay so in that sense
eight different steps

90
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840

 

91
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,309

is kind of overkill okay

92
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319

 

93
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,070

therefore when you're practicing this

94
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
therefore when you're practicing this
 

95
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,390
therefore when you're practicing this
set i recommend

96
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
set i recommend
 

97
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,270
set i recommend
maybe you just do the two pairs or maybe

98
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
maybe you just do the two pairs or maybe
 

99
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,830
maybe you just do the two pairs or maybe
even just

100
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
even just
 

101
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,550
even just
one okay because you're going to see

102
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
one okay because you're going to see
 

103
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,270
one okay because you're going to see
that we're doing

104
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
that we're doing
 

105
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,350
that we're doing
the amy tencon quite a bit now after

106
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
the amy tencon quite a bit now after
 

107
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,430
the amy tencon quite a bit now after
this all right so again going with

108
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
this all right so again going with
 

109
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,670
this all right so again going with
six completing the set to five

110
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
six completing the set to five
 

111
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,190
six completing the set to five
i'm going to step across the line

112
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
i'm going to step across the line
 

113
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,630
i'm going to step across the line
yield burn cut across the line

114
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
yield burn cut across the line
 

115
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,990
yield burn cut across the line
okay let's try six okay as i said the

116
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
okay let's try six okay as i said the
 

117
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,990
okay let's try six okay as i said the
form gets redundant so

118
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
form gets redundant so
 

119
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,630
form gets redundant so
in count one is that's when i stepped

120
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
in count one is that's when i stepped
 

121
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,550
in count one is that's when i stepped
back and cleared the line

122
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
back and cleared the line
 

123
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,869
back and cleared the line
so the same thing i had the weight shift

124
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
so the same thing i had the weight shift
 

125
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,869
so the same thing i had the weight shift
the rotation

126
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
the rotation
 

127
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,229
the rotation
so i go to the young phase knee to toes

128
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
so i go to the young phase knee to toes
 

129
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,309
so i go to the young phase knee to toes
that'll allow me the rotation and then i

130
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
that'll allow me the rotation and then i
 

131
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,149
that'll allow me the rotation and then i
step off the line that's count one

132
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
step off the line that's count one
 

133
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,750
step off the line that's count one
well that's all you're doing in count

134
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
well that's all you're doing in count
 

135
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,070
well that's all you're doing in count
six so but you precede it with the

136
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
six so but you precede it with the
 

137
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,750
six so but you precede it with the
me so young face step

138
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
me so young face step
 

139
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,630
me so young face step
shift and now you're going to do count

140
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
shift and now you're going to do count
 

141
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,550
shift and now you're going to do count
lines so i'm going to step back and

142
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
lines so i'm going to step back and
 

143
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,110
lines so i'm going to step back and
clear the line

144
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
clear the line
 

145
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,550
clear the line
so young face shift young face

146
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
so young face shift young face
 

147
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,830
so young face shift young face
rotate step by that's count the first

148
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
rotate step by that's count the first
 

149
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,710
rotate step by that's count the first
step and count

150
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
step and count
 

151
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,670
step and count
six so

152
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680

 

153
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,910

when you do count six don't stay on the

154
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
when you do count six don't stay on the
 

155
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,670
when you do count six don't stay on the
line and come straight back here

156
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680

 

157
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,030

and don't double pivot don't have your

158
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
and don't double pivot don't have your
 

159
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,350
and don't double pivot don't have your
line of gravity between so

160
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
line of gravity between so
 

161
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,390
line of gravity between so
shift shift

162
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
shift shift
 

163
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,470
shift shift
turn oh in and then repeat the flight

164
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
turn oh in and then repeat the flight
 

165
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,910
turn oh in and then repeat the flight
okay seven again the redundancy is here

166
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
okay seven again the redundancy is here
 

167
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,229
okay seven again the redundancy is here
that's why we're not going into detail

168
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
that's why we're not going into detail
 

169
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,630
that's why we're not going into detail
so seven is the db10 con put on the uh

170
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
so seven is the db10 con put on the uh

application
 

233
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,629
application
so uh for example

234
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
so uh for example
 

235
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,070
so uh for example
let's say my form has an inward

236
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
let's say my form has an inward
 

237
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,189
let's say my form has an inward
type movement so he does his stride

238
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
type movement so he does his stride
 

239
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,790
type movement so he does his stride

and i can use it as a block but
 

241
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,189
and i can use it as a block but
that same thing could be boom a smash

that same thing could be boom a smash
the same thing he goes again right it

244
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
the same thing he goes again right it
 

245
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,670
the same thing he goes again right it
could be a trap

246
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,110

so in other words still it's not that

340
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
so in other words still it's not that
 

341
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,189
so in other words still it's not that
i'm throwing myself

342
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
i'm throwing myself
 

343
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,230
i'm throwing myself
at him i can

344
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
at him i can
 

345
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,589
at him i can
use my inertia

346
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
use my inertia
 

347
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,829
use my inertia
but still connect it to a ground pop

348
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
but still connect it to a ground pop
 

349
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,870
but still connect it to a ground pop
when i hit so when i cut

350
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880

 

351
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,110

it's not that i'm moving

352
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120

 

353
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,910

so if you pay attention i end up cutting

354
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
so if you pay attention i end up cutting
 

355
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,509
so if you pay attention i end up cutting
on one leg

356
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519

 

357
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,230

i always you're gonna always seek your

358
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
i always you're gonna always seek your
 

359
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,190
i always you're gonna always seek your
stance

360
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
stance
 

361
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,870
stance
boom when you cut

362
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
boom when you cut
 

363
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,829
boom when you cut
not cut out my legs

364
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839

 

365
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,269

i do whatever the form is face

366
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
i do whatever the form is face
 

367
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,990
i do whatever the form is face
cut not

368
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000

 

369
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,430

370
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
going forward base base
 

371
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,230
going forward base base
boom cut and the same thing goes when i

372
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
boom cut and the same thing goes when i
 

373
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,829
boom cut and the same thing goes when i
do the turning maneuvers

374
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
do the turning maneuvers
 

375
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,870
do the turning maneuvers
so uh ski when i turn

376
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
so uh ski when i turn
 

377
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,829
so uh ski when i turn
i'm not going to go forward again i'm

378
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
i'm not going to go forward again i'm
 

379
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,350
i'm not going to go forward again i'm
cutting on one leg so i turn

380
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
cutting on one leg so i turn
 

381
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,710
cutting on one leg so i turn
and i drop

382
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720

cochlear power requires a ground

394
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
cochlear power requires a ground
 

395
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,070
cochlear power requires a ground
vectoring it's not

396
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
vectoring it's not
 

397
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,829
vectoring it's not
inertia power

398

399
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,590

so i'm always looking for that ground

400
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
so i'm always looking for that ground
 

401
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,110
so i'm always looking for that ground
vector when i cut

if you watch actual sword cutting

404
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
if you watch actual sword cutting
 

405
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,269
if you watch actual sword cutting
they'll have a base

406
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
they'll have a base
 

407
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,069
they'll have a base
the sword moves it's not that they're

408
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
the sword moves it's not that they're
 

409
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,750
the sword moves it's not that they're
throwing themselves at the target

there's no power in that it's a
 

413
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,110
there's no power in that it's a
different kind of power

we're not using that inertia power
so keep that in mind tip

418
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
so keep that in mind tip
 

419
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,630
so keep that in mind tip
up tip down and
