foreign
[Music]
right good thank you very much
hey if you've got your own Sensei to
correct your uh your postures your
anything else to do with technique what
I'm going to show you tonight is some of
my Aikido
it might it'll be different to your
iwama style but
um don't worry about
what you're doing think about your own
Aikido all right
and and do that okay so another one okay
please
okay
um
all I would say on this is that when you
get to here don't try and go here
if I tried this on Stuart I wouldn't get
anywhere you've got to lift the chin
okay
okay please
yeah anyone anyone
um
but when I get to here
you know I sometimes like to do it like
cutting with a sword
okay cut straight down through the body
that's fine
up he's already gone there and so
he's off posture at that point okay
so you can do
the throw away
but you can also
come straight down
okay here
twice the backy
and on the other side
yeah
here
now Thai sabaki
and up the other side
and your name
is
all right oh I've got a technique there
shake hands here
if we can do that now look
gravity Cola spin him around
and you've got a
choke
once more
Shake
step grab the back of the collar
turn him around you've got a choke
if you do a technique correctly
as I understand it
there isn't supposed to be a counter to
that technique all right
for instance if
you can do the tiny coat of guys okay
yeah Tower
there shouldn't be a counter to that
okay
but we need to be aware of it yeah
okay
if the code of guys isn't coming on
then what you've got to do is you're
going to straighten your arm
sorry yeah
whoops yeah
straighten your arm here
whoops
and you can do lots of different
techniques from the end of it yeah
straighten your arm
so you're doing a counter
to the Cody guy from Nick Hill
okay you're doing liquor here
again
yeah there
okay
you see it yet
here
we're all taught
when we do Nick Hill
here this
business
all right well we taught you for a
reason
because we're taught
that when we're doing the kill
we're cutting through here so we we make
a hand blade here okay
we've got the nickel
right
but
it does layers on to counter technique
so
for me when you do
Nick Gill
yeah
you need to
not do that except learning learning yes
always because you've got to start your
basic somewhere
but
grab
grab as soon as you can
yeah sorry
yeah
you don't need much you almost do it
blindfolded
okay
here
now we do it from here okay you're going
to Nick you
thank you
you don't even you don't need to even
see it you know if your hand goes there
it's it's on straight away
all right this is ryoti Dory here okay
