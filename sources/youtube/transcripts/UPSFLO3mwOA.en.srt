so in this Dr my hands don't go in and

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,240
so in this Dr my hands don't go in and
 

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,990
so in this Dr my hands don't go in and
out I hands stay where they are stay

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,000
out I hands stay where they are stay
 

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,910
out I hands stay where they are stay
where

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920

 

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,910

they does that is that

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:18,920

 

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,349

visible

10
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359

 

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:31,509

now now and stay

12
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519

 

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,670

how far can my front knee

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:34,680
how far can my front knee
 

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,270
how far can my front knee
go to the yog line which is to the

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
go to the yog line which is to the
 

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,830
go to the yog line which is to the
toes so I can't

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
toes so I can't
 

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,310
toes so I can't
go past

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320

 

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,990

it the back foot the back knees on the

22
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
it the back foot the back knees on the
 

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,830
it the back foot the back knees on the
young line then the front on the young

24
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
young line then the front on the young
 

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,150
young line then the front on the young
one

26
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
one
 

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,310
one
boom okay try it

28
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320

 

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,310

okay do not

30
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,320
okay do not
 

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,910
okay do not
emphasize him like you're right now do

32
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:08,920
emphasize him like you're right now do
 

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,670
emphasize him like you're right now do
not do that so if I'm doing the solo

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
not do that so if I'm doing the solo
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,030
not do that so if I'm doing the solo
training then the Y energy is going into

36
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
training then the Y energy is going into
 

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,230
training then the Y energy is going into
me and I'm dropping it I now amplify the

38
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
me and I'm dropping it I now amplify the
 

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,670
me and I'm dropping it I now amplify the
Y energy with him okay so I bring that

40
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:26,680
Y energy with him okay so I bring that
 

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,069
Y energy with him okay so I bring that
onto the back F when I go forward the

42
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
onto the back F when I go forward the
 

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,950
onto the back F when I go forward the
young energy will amplify again so

44
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
young energy will amplify again so
 

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,109
young energy will amplify again so
instead of being back on the surface

46
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
instead of being back on the surface
 

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,270
instead of being back on the surface
with his

48
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,280
with his
 

49
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,429
with his
hands I keep entering that young

50
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:42,439
hands I keep entering that young
 

51
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,310
hands I keep entering that young
energy into

52
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320

 

53
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,190

me so as I'm doing this then I shouldn't

54
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,200
me so as I'm doing this then I shouldn't
 

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,190
me so as I'm doing this then I shouldn't
have to move because that has nothing to

56
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
have to move because that has nothing to
 

57
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,990
have to move because that has nothing to
do just there's no movement in this solo

58
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,000
do just there's no movement in this solo
 

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,350
do just there's no movement in this solo
drills it's not movement related mov

60
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
drills it's not movement related mov
 

61
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,910
drills it's not movement related mov
is just trying

62
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
is just trying
 

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,149
is just trying
to make the energy more gross for the

64
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
to make the energy more gross for the
 

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,630
to make the energy more gross for the
less sensitive that's all it's trying to

66
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
less sensitive that's all it's trying to
 

67
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,510
less sensitive that's all it's trying to
do but you don't want to change the

um I can come around the outside you see
 

129
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,390
um I can come around the outside you see
and get pull and then he'll do the

130
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
and get pull and then he'll do the
 

131
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,030
and get pull and then he'll do the
counter fear reaction he goes back and

132
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,040
counter fear reaction he goes back and
 

133
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,310
