1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,269

all right um

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279

 

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,910

so your basics will work in combination

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
so your basics will work in combination
 

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,150
so your basics will work in combination
with each other

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
with each other
 

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,749
with each other
um

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
um
 

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,269
um
ones you're going to find

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
ones you're going to find
 

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,269
ones you're going to find
usually there's four

12
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
usually there's four
 

13
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,910
usually there's four
in my experience

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
in my experience
 

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,150
in my experience
at the beginner level that work well

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
at the beginner level that work well
 

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,429
at the beginner level that work well
together okay

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439

 

19
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,870

one is that is the mount reversal

20
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880

 

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,389

other one is

22
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
other one is
 

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,110
other one is
elbow knee

24
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120

 

25
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,150

this one

26
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
this one
 

27
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,510
this one
this variant too

28
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
this variant too
 

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,190
this variant too
and then last

30
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
and then last
 

31
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,990
and then last
uh

32
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
uh
 

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,750
uh
you get him

34
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
you get him
 

35
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,590
you get him
off to the side

36
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
off to the side
 

37
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,630
off to the side
and come over okay

38
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
and come over okay
 

39
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,830
and come over okay
they will feed each

40
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
they will feed each
 

41
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,990
they will feed each
other however

42
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
other however
 

43
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,349
other however
that's a tactical system

44
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
that's a tactical system
 

45
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,230
that's a tactical system
you also have a strategic system

46
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
you also have a strategic system
 

47
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,230
you also have a strategic system
and that is

48
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
and that is
 

49
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,510
and that is
um

50
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
um
 

51
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,270
um
kazushi

52
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
kazushi
 

53
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,070
kazushi
always go for kazushi

54
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
always go for kazushi
 

55
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,710
always go for kazushi
it's very difficult for him

56
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
it's very difficult for him
 

57
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,190
it's very difficult for him
to launch an attack

58
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
to launch an attack
 

59
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,830
to launch an attack
while he has to choose between launching

60
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
while he has to choose between launching
 

61
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,350
while he has to choose between launching
the attack

62
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
the attack
 

63
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,830
the attack
and maintaining his balance and hence

64
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
and maintaining his balance and hence
 

65
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,109
and maintaining his balance and hence
his positioning or his dominance

66
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
his positioning or his dominance
 

67
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,789
his positioning or his dominance
um so

68
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
um so
 

69
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,990
um so
as he goes to strike

70
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
as he goes to strike
 

71
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,990
as he goes to strike
uh you would affect

72
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
uh you would affect
 

73
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,830
uh you would affect
his kazushi

74
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
his kazushi
 

75
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,789
his kazushi
as as he's doing that his balance it

76
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
as as he's doing that his balance it
 

77
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,030
as as he's doing that his balance it
would affect his balance okay

78
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
would affect his balance okay
 

79
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,910
would affect his balance okay
so for example he goes to strike

80
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
so for example he goes to strike
 

81
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,190
so for example he goes to strike
and here

82
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
and here
 

83
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,109
and here
and you got the other one

84
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
and you got the other one
 

85
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,030
and you got the other one
you'll see it there

86
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
you'll see it there
 

87
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,670
you'll see it there
as opposed to

88
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
as opposed to
 

89
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,149
as opposed to
trying for that one when he hasn't done

90
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
trying for that one when he hasn't done
 

91
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,749
trying for that one when he hasn't done
anything

92
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
anything
 

93
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,990
anything
i try for that one

94
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
i try for that one
 

95
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,789
i try for that one
and he'll be able to do different things

96
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
and he'll be able to do different things
 

97
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,950
and he'll be able to do different things
including that punch

98
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
including that punch
 

99
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,429
including that punch
on the next beat so

100
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
on the next beat so
 

101
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,710
on the next beat so
i go off get his balance and he comes

102
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
i go off get his balance and he comes
 

103
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,309
i go off get his balance and he comes
back and punches

104
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319

 

105
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,190

so always pay attention he can't do both

106
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
so always pay attention he can't do both
 

107
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,790
so always pay attention he can't do both
at the same time so use kazushi to stop

108
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
at the same time so use kazushi to stop
 

109
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,430
at the same time so use kazushi to stop
a lot of his things

110
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
a lot of his things
 

111
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,910
a lot of his things
and then two when you learn the moves

112
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
and then two when you learn the moves
 

113
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,390
and then two when you learn the moves
without the strikes

114
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
without the strikes
 

115
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,229
without the strikes
you get to do them wherever you want

116
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
you get to do them wherever you want
 

117
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,990
you get to do them wherever you want
in space um

118
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
in space um
 

119
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,790
in space um
but

120
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
but
 

121
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,350
but
it's not so free for all

122
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
it's not so free for all
 

123
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,350
it's not so free for all
you have to pay attention to his power

124
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
you have to pay attention to his power
 

125
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,470
you have to pay attention to his power
lines

126
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
lines
 

127
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,270
lines
okay and that's his shoulder lines

128
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
okay and that's his shoulder lines
 

129
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,110
okay and that's his shoulder lines
so for example

130
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
so for example
 

131
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,470
so for example
um

132
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
um
 

133
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,030
um
let's say i'm going to do

134
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
let's say i'm going to do
 

135
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,110
let's say i'm going to do
uh this one

136
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
uh this one
 

137
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,710
uh this one
my head

138
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
my head
 

139
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,030
my head
is underneath this power line of his

140
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
is underneath this power line of his
 

141
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,229
is underneath this power line of his
shoulder

142
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
shoulder
 

143
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,030
shoulder
so when i go to pass his leg it's when

144
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
so when i go to pass his leg it's when
 

145
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,830
so when i go to pass his leg it's when
i'm going to get popped

146
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
i'm going to get popped
 

147
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,949
i'm going to get popped
instead

148
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
instead
 

149
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,869
instead
i have to

150
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
i have to
 

151
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,630
i have to
get off that power line in this case by

152
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
get off that power line in this case by
 

153
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,589
get off that power line in this case by
going deeper into him

154
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
going deeper into him
 

155
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,830
going deeper into him
than not paying attention to this power

156
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
than not paying attention to this power
 

157
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,949
than not paying attention to this power
line

158
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
line
 

159
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,670
line
so

160
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
so
 

161
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,790
so
generally you'll go in deeper

162
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
generally you'll go in deeper
 

163
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,309
generally you'll go in deeper
past it

164
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
past it
 

165
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,830
past it
or

166
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
or
 

167
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,869
or
to the outside of it okay it doesn't

168
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
to the outside of it okay it doesn't
 

169
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,750
to the outside of it okay it doesn't
really work to get up here because he

170
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
really work to get up here because he
 

171
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,990
really work to get up here because he
just moves with you and the power line

172
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
just moves with you and the power line
 

173
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,830
just moves with you and the power line
is on there you can do that as he

174
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
is on there you can do that as he
 

175
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,149
is on there you can do that as he
punches even boom you see

176
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
punches even boom you see
 

177
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,070
punches even boom you see
so it's usually he goes usually you're

178
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
so it's usually he goes usually you're
 

179
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,750
so it's usually he goes usually you're
in tight

180
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760

your last resort
 

189
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,070
your last resort
should be

190
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080

191
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,789
should be
tying him up okay

192
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
tying him up okay
 

193
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,670
tying him up okay
so

194
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
so
 

195
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,110
so
let's say

196
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
let's say
 

197
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,390
let's say
i'm trying to get his balance

198
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
i'm trying to get his balance
 

199
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,869
i'm trying to get his balance
he comes back with the punch maybe

200
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
he comes back with the punch maybe
 

201
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,149
he comes back with the punch maybe
that's where i tied him up okay

202
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
that's where i tied him up okay
 

203
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,830
that's where i tied him up okay
um but you'll see oh that's mount

204
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
um but you'll see oh that's mount
 

205
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,390
um but you'll see oh that's mount
reversal

206
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
reversal
 

207
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,189
reversal
but if i do it in a way

208
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
but if i do it in a way
 

209
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,949
but if i do it in a way
that i'm not paying attention to those

210
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
that i'm not paying attention to those
 

211
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,629
that i'm not paying attention to those
first two things you're going to get

212
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
first two things you're going to get
 

213
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,710
first two things you're going to get
punched over here with the other hands

214
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
punched over here with the other hands
 

215
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,710
punched over here with the other hands
he punches me boom and you're going to

216
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
he punches me boom and you're going to
 

217
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,189
he punches me boom and you're going to
let go of that thing okay

218
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
let go of that thing okay
 

219
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,030
let go of that thing okay
so again maybe i he goes to punch pull

220
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
so again maybe i he goes to punch pull
 

221
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,990
so again maybe i he goes to punch pull
he comes back right go to the outside

222
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
he comes back right go to the outside
 

223
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,590
he comes back right go to the outside
and now i have

224
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
and now i have
 

225
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,550
and now i have

all right

244
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840

 

245
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,950

let's work that four-point dilemma

246
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
let's work that four-point dilemma
 

247
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,150
let's work that four-point dilemma
and

248
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
and
 

249
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,310
and
try to work these strategies

250
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320

 

251
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,270

okay

252
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
okay
 

253
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,830
okay
uh watch your desk just go watch your

254
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
uh watch your desk just go watch your
 

255
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,350
uh watch your desk just go watch your
desperation your arms are out here okay

256
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
desperation your arms are out here okay
 

257
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,629
desperation your arms are out here okay
this is not ever good you don't

258
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
this is not ever good you don't
 

259
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,070
this is not ever good you don't
ever go past

260
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
ever go past
 

261
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,310
ever go past
your frame okay um

262
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320

 

263
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,749

because he can he'll he can trap my arms

264
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
because he can he'll he can trap my arms
 

265
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,749
because he can he'll he can trap my arms
and create uh

266
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
and create uh
 

267
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:41,430
and create uh
his arm attacks he can isolate them so

268
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440

 

269
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,749

you can travel arm get it outside and

270
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
you can travel arm get it outside and
 

271
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,310
you can travel arm get it outside and
create an angle of attack do you see oh

272
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
create an angle of attack do you see oh
 

273
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,710
create an angle of attack do you see oh
crap he's gonna get two three good

274
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
crap he's gonna get two three good
 

275
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,990
crap he's gonna get two three good
solid punches from that

276
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
solid punches from that
 

277
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,590
solid punches from that
so

278
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
so
 

279
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,749
so
uh as you're doing your moves you're

280
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
uh as you're doing your moves you're
 

281
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,510
uh as you're doing your moves you're
going to find out the jiu-jitsu

282
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
going to find out the jiu-jitsu
 

283
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,590
going to find out the jiu-jitsu
principle works best

284
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
principle works best
 

285
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,550
principle works best

bridge
 

299
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,950
bridge
okay so the most i'll do is

300
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
okay so the most i'll do is
 

301
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,390
okay so the most i'll do is
a bridge

302
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
a bridge
 

303
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,950
a bridge
to get him now he has to do something

304
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
to get him now he has to do something
 

305
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,990
to get him now he has to do something
you see so as he goes to do something

306
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
you see so as he goes to do something
 

307
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,629
you see so as he goes to do something
that's when i move my arms never really

308
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
that's when i move my arms never really
 

309

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
and same thing it's like oh you're so
 

313
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,670
and same thing it's like oh you're so
close but don't you can't extend your

314
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
close but don't you can't extend your
 

315
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,550
close but don't you can't extend your
arms so you move your body instead

316
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
arms so you move your body instead
 

317
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,950
arms so you move your body instead
is what you'll do

318
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
is what you'll do
 

319
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,550
is what you'll do
okay

320
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
okay
 

321
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,749
okay
um

322
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
um
 

323
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,390
um
if he goes ahead and punches first

324
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
if he goes ahead and punches first
 

325
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,830
if he goes ahead and punches first
then it's easy it's much easier okay

326
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840

 

327
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,629

just remember he can't do both so if

328
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
just remember he can't do both so if
 

329
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,070
just remember he can't do both so if
he's not doing one i will do the other

330
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
he's not doing one i will do the other
 

331
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,790
he's not doing one i will do the other
that's how it kind of works okay

332
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
that's how it kind of works okay
 

333
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,830
that's how it kind of works okay
um

334
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
um
 

335
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,950
um
so

336
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
so
 

337
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,430
so
he goes and i'm just

338
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
he goes and i'm just
 

339
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,230
he goes and i'm just
in close and this was a knee bump to

340
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
in close and this was a knee bump to
 

341
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,309
in close and this was a knee bump to
deal with his balance okay

342
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
deal with his balance okay
 

343
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,110
deal with his balance okay
so he'll do something again

344
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
so he'll do something again
 

345
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,270
so he'll do something again
and i attack that kazushi again with

346
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
and i attack that kazushi again with
 

347
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,189
and i attack that kazushi again with
another nepa

348
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
another nepa
 

349
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,029
another nepa
he goes again

350
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
he goes again

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
it there is a balance and there's an
 

459
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,350
it there is a balance and there's an
athleticism to whether kazushi works or

460
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
athleticism to whether kazushi works or
 

461

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
at a dynamic equilibrium
 

467
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,750
at a dynamic equilibrium
that's how much more difficult it is for

468
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
that's how much more difficult it is for
 

469
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,190

520
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
right
 

521
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,829
right
and oh there it is

522
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
and oh there it is
 

523
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,190
and oh there it is
and then boom

524
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200

 

525
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,110

so i'm going to look for these striking

526
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
so i'm going to look for these striking
 

527
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,350
so i'm going to look for these striking
traps and then i'll reset the drill you

528
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
traps and then i'll reset the drill you
 

529
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,870
traps and then i'll reset the drill you
can go it doesn't buck because you're

530
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
can go it doesn't buck because you're
 

531
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,550
can go it doesn't buck because you're
still on the shoulder line

532
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560

 

533
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,110

so see when he reaches and he pushes

534
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
so see when he reaches and he pushes
 

535
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,870
so see when he reaches and he pushes
there it is there every single time okay

536
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
there it is there every single time okay
 

537
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,350
there it is there every single time okay
so you punch and look how he dropped the

538
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
so you punch and look how he dropped the
 

539
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,350
so you punch and look how he dropped the
elbow do you see and well there's the

540
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
elbow do you see and well there's the

what move of those four is helped by
this foot being right there

692
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440

 

693
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,710

700
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
well your base has a narrowing energy
 

701
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,230
well your base has a narrowing energy
do you understand okay and that's why i

702
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
do you understand okay and that's why i

do this
because if i don't do that and i go for

706
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
because if i don't do that and i go for
 

707
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,069
because if i don't do that and i go for
the amount reversal you'll use that

708
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
the amount reversal you'll use that
 

709
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,550

over here it's never going to happen
 

885
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,510
over here it's never going to happen
because

886
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
because
 

887
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,630
because

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
is look for the energy here this energy
 

893
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,870

to work with do you see

894
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
to work with do you see
 

895
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,510

to one side it's going to be harder if
 

899
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,150
to one side it's going to be harder if
i'm sitting here

900
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
i'm sitting here
 

901
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,990

this way it's going to be hard but if

904
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
this way it's going to be hard but if
 

905
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,870
this way it's going to be hard but if
i'm moving that way then it's going to

906
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
i'm moving that way then it's going to
 

907
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,310
i'm moving that way then it's going to
be easy

908
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
be easy
 

909
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,110
