00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
this point at the wrist grab as what is
 

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,889
this point at the wrist grab as what is
most important and so it starts to set

on one end I'm on the other and you

56
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
on one end I'm on the other and you
 

57
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,740
on one end I'm on the other and you
start functioning around here okay what

58
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:54,750
start functioning around here okay what
 

59
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,249
start functioning around here okay what
I'm advocating for you to do is yes he

60
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:58,259
I'm advocating for you to do is yes he
 

61
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,959

comes in and but the techniques are

62
00:01:59,959 --> 00:01:59,969
comes in and but the techniques are
 

63
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,289
comes in and but the techniques are
actually going to start

64
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,299

 

65
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:11,880

so even if I am doing Jo dog you see the

66
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:11,890
so even if I am doing Jo dog you see the
 

67
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,039
so even if I am doing Jo dog you see the
technique I'm not actually pivoting

68
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,049
technique I'm not actually pivoting
 

69
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:20,550
technique I'm not actually pivoting
around this point you see that own

70
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
around this point you see that own
 

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:30,860
around this point you see that own
technique is going over here over here

72
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:30,870

 

73
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,460

okay so watch pay attention to my Center

74
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,470
okay so watch pay attention to my Center
 

75
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,289
okay so watch pay attention to my Center
how I'm making that happen

76
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:37,299
how I'm making that happen

what you see wait there's a weight shift
 

79
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,690
what you see wait there's a weight shift
and then in relation to what yes it's

80
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:45,700
and then in relation to what yes it's

could actually make that your goal if I

90
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
could actually make that your goal if I
 

91
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,930
could actually make that your goal if I
leave it there in my mind and I act like

92
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:06,940
leave it there in my mind and I act like
 

93
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,509
leave it there in my mind and I act like
it's there then I am participating in

94
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
it's there then I am participating in
 

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,479
it's there then I am participating in
the conflict but if I immediately take

96
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:12,489
the conflict but if I immediately take
 

97
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,509
the conflict but if I immediately take
it over here then I have done of the

98
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
it over here then I have done of the
 

99
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,210
it over here then I have done of the
first conflict resolution you guys see

100
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,220
first conflict resolution you guys see
 

101
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,490
first conflict resolution you guys see
that well then the question is how do

102
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:20,500
that well then the question is how do
 

103
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,300
that well then the question is how do
you do it so even when I'm doing

104
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,310
you do it so even when I'm doing
 

105
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,880
you do it so even when I'm doing
title I know it's not here

106
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:32,890

there's the first clue is a tiny shift

108
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,060
there's the first clue is a tiny shift
 

109
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,120
there's the first clue is a tiny shift
you see that it's a tiny shift tiny mole

110
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,130
you see that it's a tiny shift tiny mole
 

111

you see that it's a tiny shift tiny mole
in turn turn and just like everything

112
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,070
in turn turn and just like everything
 

113
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,310

can be better it could be internal

114
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,320
can be better it could be internal
 

115
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,130
can be better it could be internal
it could be internal this year relax

116
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
it could be internal this year relax
 

117
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,060

okay in here no

120
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:09,630
okay in here no
 

121
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,780
okay in here no
and so my wristwatch how I'm going to

122
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:12,790
and so my wristwatch how I'm going to
 

123
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,229
and so my wristwatch how I'm going to
create space for his grip so if I hold

124
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
create space for his grip so if I hold
 

125
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,140
create space for his grip so if I hold
it it's in space here the conflict

126
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,150
it it's in space here the conflict
 

127
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,390
it it's in space here the conflict
starts but I'm going to give him more

128
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,400
starts but I'm going to give him more
 

129
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,720
starts but I'm going to give him more
range by adding the spiral do you see

130
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,730
range by adding the spiral do you see
 

131
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,610

that so in other words take your hand

132
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,620
that so in other words take your hand
 

133
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,680
that so in other words take your hand
there when I go like this his hand has

134
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:34,690
there when I go like this his hand has
 

135
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,740
there when I go like this his hand has
all that distance to reconcile the

136
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:37,750
all that distance to reconcile the
 

137
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,060
all that distance to reconcile the
conflict and not push on me so if I just

138
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,070
conflict and not push on me so if I just
 

139
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,270
conflict and not push on me so if I just
go straight across this part is as long

140
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
go straight across this part is as long
 

141
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,550
go straight across this part is as long
but not the part that coiled under

142
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,560
but not the part that coiled under
 

143
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680

that's a good extra two to three inches

144
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:49,690
that's a good extra two to three inches
 

145
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,020
that's a good extra two to three inches
and that also gives you your angle

146
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,030
and that also gives you your angle
 

147
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,590
and that also gives you your angle

this year that's not free space even if
I torque his thumb it's not free space

164
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,330
I torque his thumb it's not free space
 

165
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,770
I torque his thumb it's not free space
so when I go over here look when I enter

166
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:35,780
so when I go over here look when I enter
 

167
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,930
so when I go over here look when I enter
I'm past the point of conflicts when you

168
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm past the point of conflicts when you
 

169
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm past the point of conflicts when you
can't push on the whole then you can't

170
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:43,850
can't push on the whole then you can't
 

171
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,670
can't push on the whole then you can't
stop this for nothing because I'm

172
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
stop this for nothing because I'm
 

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:06:08,620
stop this for nothing because I'm
nowhere okay so boom this step change

174
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:08,630
nowhere okay so boom this step change
 

175
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:15,129
nowhere okay so boom this step change
the idea of everything same things

176
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:15,139
the idea of everything same things
 

177
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,779
the idea of everything same things
okay so here I'm gonna stop the

178
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:16,789
okay so here I'm gonna stop the
 

179
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,589
okay so here I'm gonna stop the
technique and go ahead and push it's not

180
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:20,599
technique and go ahead and push it's not
 

181
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:27,120
technique and go ahead and push it's not
mushy okay push hard I start to turn

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,130
mushy okay push hard I start to turn
 

183
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,879
mushy okay push hard I start to turn
push hard it's not pushy I still have

184
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:30,889
push hard it's not pushy I still have
 

185
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,500
push hard it's not pushy I still have
the same projection capacity okay so

186
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,510
the same projection capacity okay so
 

187
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,860
the same projection capacity okay so
it's the same form but I'm taking all of

188
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:38,870
it's the same form but I'm taking all of
 

189
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,350
it's the same form but I'm taking all of
this energetic

190
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
this energetic
 

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:54,440
this energetic
and not using it to push back on them

192
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450

 

193
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,790

here's why you're not stepping here is

194
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
here's why you're not stepping here is
 

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,690
here's why you're not stepping here is
important

196
00:06:59,690 --> 00:06:59,700
important
 

197

we can still push on me even though I

204
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,230
we can still push on me even though I
 

205
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,240
we can still push on me even though I
I'm grounded that's how what we're

206
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,250
I'm grounded that's how what we're
 

207
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,450
I'm grounded that's how what we're
trying to do inside momento okay so as

208
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:20,460
trying to do inside momento okay so as
 

209
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,230

we're here like this if I don't step he

210
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
we're here like this if I don't step he
 

211
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,420
we're here like this if I don't step he
can still there's still a lot of energy

212
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,430
can still there's still a lot of energy
 

213
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,020
can still there's still a lot of energy
there but the second I move this there

214
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,030
there but the second I move this there
 

215
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,050
there but the second I move this there
there's no more energy coming towards

216
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,060
there's no more energy coming towards
 

217
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,510
there's no more energy coming towards
because it's going forward and I move

218
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
because it's going forward and I move
 

219
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,420
because it's going forward and I move
into this right here there's a lot of

220
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,430
into this right here there's a lot of
 

221
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,770
into this right here there's a lot of
energy right there step and then turn

222
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:48,780
energy right there step and then turn
 

223
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:58,130
energy right there step and then turn
and now it's off it's going that way

224
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,140

 

225
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,460

okay then because this risk rubbing

226
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,470
okay then because this risk rubbing
 

227
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,980
okay then because this risk rubbing
energy is it just an abstraction for

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:03,990
energy is it just an abstraction for
 

229
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,250
energy is it just an abstraction for
spinal displacement it's not a risk crab

230
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,260
spinal displacement it's not a risk crab
 

231
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,640
spinal displacement it's not a risk crab
attack right so you have to watch the

232
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,650
attack right so you have to watch the
 

233
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,980
attack right so you have to watch the
ways in which you're making it or this

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
crab attack one of the things if you're
 

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,130
crab attack one of the things if you're
training properly it should be able to

238
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,140
training properly it should be able to
 

239
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,020
training properly it should be able to
be a ballistic attack - it could be a

240
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,030
be a ballistic attack - it could be a
 

241
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,700
be a ballistic attack - it could be a

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,150
see how I stopped him that's the
 

247
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,970
see how I stopped him that's the

should not the young reconciliation
 

253
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,770
should not the young reconciliation
happen already here so I'm pulling his

happen already here so I'm pulling his
 

255
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,600
happen already here so I'm pulling his
intention in not going like this and his

can about an inch or two of his mind
 

261
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,870
can about an inch or two of his mind
that's about it

262
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
that's about it
 

263
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,830
that's about it
it's the same thing if we're in tight

264
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:00,840
it's the same thing if we're in tight
 

265

that strike do you see that do you guys

272
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,030
that strike do you see that do you guys
 

273
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,880
that strike do you see that do you guys

be able to not let them read you to let

278
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:23,730
be able to not let them read you to let
 

279
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,780
be able to not let them read you to let
them to be able to to go through with

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:26,790
them to be able to to go through with
 

281
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,710
them to be able to to go through with
this motion without okay and what lesson

282
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
this motion without okay and what lesson
 

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:40,760
this motion without okay and what lesson
what allows this motion what level of my

284
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:40,770
what allows this motion what level of my
 

285
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,180
what allows this motion what level of my
actually fighting at my the mind level

286
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,190
actually fighting at my the mind level
 

287
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,820
actually fighting at my the mind level
okay so you just already hit me I'm

288
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:46,830
okay so you just already hit me I'm
 

289
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,640
okay so you just already hit me I'm
using it against them you can about an

290
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:49,650
using it against them you can about an
 

291
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,380
using it against them you can about an
inch or two do you understand not not

292
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,390
inch or two do you understand not not
 

293
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,700
inch or two do you understand not not
this that that's too far you get about

294
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:58,710
this that that's too far you get about
 

295
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,490
this that that's too far you get about
into just like we technique I show you

296
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:01,500
into just like we technique I show you
 

297
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:13,340
into just like we technique I show you
okay so there is this is wrong but then

298
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,350
okay so there is this is wrong but then
 

299
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:57,329
okay so there is this is wrong but then
this is equally wrong both that time it

300
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:57,339

 

301
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,210

then therefore I'm not pulling it I

302
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,220
then therefore I'm not pulling it I
 

303
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,600
then therefore I'm not pulling it I
don't stop them set up the conflict and

304
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,610
don't stop them set up the conflict and
 

305
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,750
don't stop them set up the conflict and
then I hold him I'm not doing that I

306
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
then I hold him I'm not doing that I
 

307
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,150
then I hold him I'm not doing that I
agree to it and we'll just watch

308
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,160
agree to it and we'll just watch
 

309
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,220
agree to it and we'll just watch
slow-motion again so here's the issue

310
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,230
slow-motion again so here's the issue
 

311
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,180
slow-motion again so here's the issue
you just get that little lean and I'll

312
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,190
you just get that little lean and I'll
 

313
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,420
you just get that little lean and I'll
try and stop it in there right there

314
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,430
try and stop it in there right there
 

315
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,960
try and stop it in there right there
okay now I'm going to take his weight

316
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:28,970
okay now I'm going to take his weight
 

317
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,590
okay now I'm going to take his weight
like that so he's just perpetually

318
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
like that so he's just perpetually
 

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,620
like that so he's just perpetually

so work either the to be mechanics and
then you have the single big mechanics

502
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:51,750
then you have the single big mechanics
