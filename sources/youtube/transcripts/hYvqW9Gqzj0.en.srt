i'm going to start with a really simple

18
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
i'm going to start with a really simple
 

19
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,590
i'm going to start with a really simple
set of ideas and we're going to build

20
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
set of ideas and we're going to build
 

21
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,870
set of ideas and we're going to build
from there i'm going to kind of talk

22
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
from there i'm going to kind of talk
 

23
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,589
from there i'm going to kind of talk
about the concept of index so if some of

24
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
about the concept of index so if some of
 

25
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,029
about the concept of index so if some of
that seems confusing you can watch the

26
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
that seems confusing you can watch the
 

27
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,790
that seems confusing you can watch the
video i made on index

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
video i made on index
 

29
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,150
video i made on index
but basically uh the there are some root

30
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
but basically uh the there are some root
 

31
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,510
but basically uh the there are some root
core things you're going to do that are

32
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
core things you're going to do that are
 

33
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,990
core things you're going to do that are
really simple that are in the forms but

34
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
really simple that are in the forms but
 

35
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,990
really simple that are in the forms but
are kind of hard to pull out of the form

36
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
are kind of hard to pull out of the form
 

37
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,270
are kind of hard to pull out of the form
sometimes if we're not looking at the

38
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
sometimes if we're not looking at the
 

39
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,869
sometimes if we're not looking at the
forms right so that's we're going to

40
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
forms right so that's we're going to
 

41
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,389
forms right so that's we're going to

in all kinds of stuff keep distance all

86
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
in all kinds of stuff keep distance all
 

87
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,670
in all kinds of stuff keep distance all
the other stuff all right now the first

88
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
the other stuff all right now the first
 

89
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,350
the other stuff all right now the first
concern you should have when someone

90
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
concern you should have when someone
 

91
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,590
concern you should have when someone
grabs your weapon is that if they get it

92
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
grabs your weapon is that if they get it
 

93
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,990
grabs your weapon is that if they get it
with one hand almost immediately after

94
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
with one hand almost immediately after
 

95
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,670
with one hand almost immediately after
two hands are going to come on now it's

96
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
two hands are going to come on now it's
 

97
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,429
two hands are going to come on now it's
much harder to deal with two hands in

98
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
much harder to deal with two hands in
 

99
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,590
much harder to deal with two hands in
one hand and i know that's obvious but

100
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
one hand and i know that's obvious but
 

101
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,510
one hand and i know that's obvious but
it needs to be said because i would love

102
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
it needs to be said because i would love
 

103
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,670
it needs to be said because i would love
to deal with this when he just gets it

104
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
to deal with this when he just gets it
 

105
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,109
to deal with this when he just gets it
with one hand okay so i should always be

106
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
with one hand okay so i should always be
 

107
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,350
with one hand okay so i should always be
working away from that hand meaning i

108
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
working away from that hand meaning i
 

109
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,670
working away from that hand meaning i
should try not to work this way because

110
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
should try not to work this way because
 

111
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,190
should try not to work this way because
it just makes it quicker for him to grab

112
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
it just makes it quicker for him to grab
 

113
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,270
it just makes it quicker for him to grab
it i should always try to work this way

114
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
it i should always try to work this way
 

115
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,949
it i should always try to work this way
which takes a little longer for him to

116
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
which takes a little longer for him to
 

117
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,949
which takes a little longer for him to
grab it right i don't have infinite time

118
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
grab it right i don't have infinite time
 

119
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,470
grab it right i don't have infinite time
of course but i'll get a few more

120
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
of course but i'll get a few more
 

121
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,550
of course but i'll get a few more
seconds so always head to the outside

122
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
seconds so always head to the outside
 

123
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,990
seconds so always head to the outside
with these and try not to head to the

124
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
with these and try not to head to the
 

125
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,750
with these and try not to head to the
inside now that's situationally

126
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
inside now that's situationally
 

127
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,110
inside now that's situationally
dependent right so meaning if i was

128
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
dependent right so meaning if i was
 

129
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,869
dependent right so meaning if i was
being attacked by another guy here i

130
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
being attacked by another guy here i
 

131
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,150
being attacked by another guy here i
would choose to move that way even

132
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
would choose to move that way even
 

133
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,750
would choose to move that way even
though josh would maybe get two hands on

134
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
though josh would maybe get two hands on
 

135
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
though josh would maybe get two hands on
it because i don't want to go into this

136
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
it because i don't want to go into this
 

137
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,949
it because i don't want to go into this
guy because that's going to give me a

138
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
guy because that's going to give me a
 

139
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,229
guy because that's going to give me a
lot of trouble

140
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
lot of trouble
 

141
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,470
lot of trouble
so that's my first idea now the first

142
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
so that's my first idea now the first
 

143
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,710
so that's my first idea now the first
thing i want to do is how simply can i

144
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
thing i want to do is how simply can i
 

145
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,630
thing i want to do is how simply can i
get it off and basically nico and kota

146
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
get it off and basically nico and kota
 

147
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,470
get it off and basically nico and kota
guys are going to be your your go-to

148
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
guys are going to be your your go-to
 

149
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,390
guys are going to be your your go-to
tools for that right so to do that i'm

150
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
tools for that right so to do that i'm
 

151
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,150
tools for that right so to do that i'm
either going to go this way there's

152
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
either going to go this way there's
 

153
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,390
either going to go this way there's
enikyo or i'm going to go this way

154
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
enikyo or i'm going to go this way
 

155
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,710
enikyo or i'm going to go this way
there's a kodakaish okay now depending

156
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
there's a kodakaish okay now depending
 

157
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,190
there's a kodakaish okay now depending
on the index i catch him in

158
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
on the index i catch him in
 

159
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,949
on the index i catch him in
depends on what i can do with this right

160
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
depends on what i can do with this right
 

161
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,630
depends on what i can do with this right
so meaning if i catch him really early

162
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
so meaning if i catch him really early
 

163
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,030
so meaning if i catch him really early
right so maybe he's just going to grab

164
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
right so maybe he's just going to grab
 

165
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,869
right so maybe he's just going to grab
it and i'm getting it like this and so a

166
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
it and i'm getting it like this and so a
 

167
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,710
it and i'm getting it like this and so a
lot of the work's done i can take it out

168
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
lot of the work's done i can take it out
 

169
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,470
lot of the work's done i can take it out
that way really easily or same thing

170
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
that way really easily or same thing
 

171
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,509
that way really easily or same thing
sorry

172
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
sorry
 

173
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,190
sorry
the index is here and i'm getting here

174
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
the index is here and i'm getting here
 

175
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,949
the index is here and i'm getting here
and it's like if i'm right on top of it

176
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
and it's like if i'm right on top of it
 

177
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,350
and it's like if i'm right on top of it
meaning that i understand basically when

178
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
meaning that i understand basically when
 

179
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,509
meaning that i understand basically when
he's gonna grab it as he understands

180
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
he's gonna grab it as he understands
 

181
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,830
he's gonna grab it as he understands
he's gonna grab it okay now the later i

182
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
he's gonna grab it okay now the later i
 

183
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,830
he's gonna grab it okay now the later i
get the more locked down that's gonna

184
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
get the more locked down that's gonna
 

185
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,509
get the more locked down that's gonna
become to a point like this where it's

186
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
become to a point like this where it's
 

187
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,110
become to a point like this where it's
very locked down right and it's gonna be

188
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
very locked down right and it's gonna be
 

189
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,589
very locked down right and it's gonna be
hard to move and so if josh just resists

190
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
hard to move and so if josh just resists
 

191
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,830
hard to move and so if josh just resists
i can't really go either direction with

192
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
i can't really go either direction with
 

193
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,229
i can't really go either direction with
this right okay now

194
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
this right okay now
 

195
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,589
this right okay now
this is one of the things i think a lot

196
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
this is one of the things i think a lot
 

197
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,190
this is one of the things i think a lot
of times when when we show iketer

198
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
of times when when we show iketer
 

199
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,630
of times when when we show iketer
techniques something like this people

200
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
techniques something like this people
 

201
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,229
techniques something like this people
look at and they say oh well then the

202
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
look at and they say oh well then the
 

203
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,589
look at and they say oh well then the
technique doesn't work because if they

204
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
technique doesn't work because if they
 

205
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,110
technique doesn't work because if they
grab it as strong as they possibly can

206
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
grab it as strong as they possibly can
 

207
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,030
grab it as strong as they possibly can
grab but it doesn't work

208
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
grab but it doesn't work
 

209
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,229
grab but it doesn't work
we have to make adaptations as

210
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
we have to make adaptations as
 

211
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,630
we have to make adaptations as
people get stronger and we want to look

212
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
people get stronger and we want to look
 

213
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,630
people get stronger and we want to look
at all the times and not just one time

214
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
at all the times and not just one time
 

215
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,630
at all the times and not just one time
right so meaning i don't want to have to

216
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
right so meaning i don't want to have to
 

217
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,070
right so meaning i don't want to have to
always let him grab it as strong as

218
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
always let him grab it as strong as
 

219
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,509
always let him grab it as strong as
possible so i can do my strongest

220
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
possible so i can do my strongest
 

221
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,030
possible so i can do my strongest
possible technique i would like to have

222
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
possible technique i would like to have
 

223
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,030
possible technique i would like to have
got it at the index of him moving it all

224
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
got it at the index of him moving it all
 

225
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,229
got it at the index of him moving it all
right now

226
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
right now
 

227
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,550
right now
another thing to understand is that he

228
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
another thing to understand is that he
 

229
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,470
another thing to understand is that he
is probably going to move it out of his

230
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
is probably going to move it out of his
 

231
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,229
is probably going to move it out of his
way also he's not just going to leave it

232
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
way also he's not just going to leave it
 

233
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,830
way also he's not just going to leave it
there so he could pull it to the inside

234
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
there so he could pull it to the inside
 

235
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,509
there so he could pull it to the inside
for the outside for whatever reason or

236
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
for the outside for whatever reason or
 

237
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,630
for the outside for whatever reason or
you pull it to the inside for whatever

238
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
you pull it to the inside for whatever
 

239
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,869
you pull it to the inside for whatever
reason all right now if he does that so

240
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
reason all right now if he does that so
 

241
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,630
reason all right now if he does that so
let's say i'm behind an index and he's

242
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
let's say i'm behind an index and he's
 

243
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,949
let's say i'm behind an index and he's
grabbed it strong but he moves it either

244
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
grabbed it strong but he moves it either
 

245
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,750
grabbed it strong but he moves it either
to the outside that gives me a nico or

246
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
to the outside that gives me a nico or
 

247
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,509
to the outside that gives me a nico or
if he moves it to the inside that gives

248
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
if he moves it to the inside that gives
 

249
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,350
if he moves it to the inside that gives
me a coat of gauche right so i could

250
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
me a coat of gauche right so i could
 

251
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,509
me a coat of gauche right so i could
still even if he's grabbed it strong and

252
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
still even if he's grabbed it strong and
 

253
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,430
still even if he's grabbed it strong and
i can't move it i could be dependent

254
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
i can't move it i could be dependent
 

255
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,150
i can't move it i could be dependent
upon him to move it and still still work

256
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
upon him to move it and still still work
 

257
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,909
upon him to move it and still still work
and understand we're still talking about

258
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
and understand we're still talking about
 

259
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,990
and understand we're still talking about
tenths of seconds here because it's not

260
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
tenths of seconds here because it's not
 

261
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,189
tenths of seconds here because it's not
going to be long before that other hand

262
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
going to be long before that other hand
 

263
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,070
going to be long before that other hand
grabs or is hitting me or whatever so

264
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
grabs or is hitting me or whatever so
 

265
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,350
grabs or is hitting me or whatever so
another thing that will give me the

266
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
another thing that will give me the
 

267
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,909
another thing that will give me the
advan an advantage is to slide my hand

268
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
advan an advantage is to slide my hand
 

269
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,270
advan an advantage is to slide my hand
up to here and a lot of times we don't

270
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
up to here and a lot of times we don't
 

271
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,390
up to here and a lot of times we don't
talk about this but now i have a lever

272
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
talk about this but now i have a lever
 

273
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,629
talk about this but now i have a lever
that's this long right that's a long

274
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
that's this long right that's a long
 

275
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,030
that's this long right that's a long
lever over here i only have a lever

276
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
lever over here i only have a lever
 

277
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,510
lever over here i only have a lever
that's this long right so understand

278
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
that's this long right so understand
 

279
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
that's this long right so understand
that i'm really trying to inefficiently

280
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
that i'm really trying to inefficiently
 

281
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,670
that i'm really trying to inefficiently
use the weapon here whereas if i slide

282
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
use the weapon here whereas if i slide
 

283
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,710
use the weapon here whereas if i slide
my hand up i now have a ton of force

284
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
my hand up i now have a ton of force
 

285
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,310
my hand up i now have a ton of force
right and to josh that feels like

286
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
right and to josh that feels like
 

287
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,670
right and to josh that feels like
machinery all of a sudden right it

288
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
machinery all of a sudden right it
 

289
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
machinery all of a sudden right it
doesn't feel like a guy's wrestling with

290
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
doesn't feel like a guy's wrestling with
 

291
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,510
doesn't feel like a guy's wrestling with
you because this lever is so long this

292
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
you because this lever is so long this
 

293
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,350
you because this lever is so long this
feels like a machine's doing it to his

294
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
feels like a machine's doing it to his
 

295
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,110
feels like a machine's doing it to his
hand because it's just freaking strong

296
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
hand because it's just freaking strong
 

297
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,670
hand because it's just freaking strong
right so anytime you think that there's

298
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
right so anytime you think that there's
 

299
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,510
right so anytime you think that there's
trouble you should slide your hand in

300
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
trouble you should slide your hand in
 

301
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,350
trouble you should slide your hand in
next to his and that's going to start to

302
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
next to his and that's going to start to
 

303
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,189
next to his and that's going to start to
give me that advantage okay and again

304
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
give me that advantage okay and again
 

305
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,950
give me that advantage okay and again
i'm going to be working my nico and my

306
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
i'm going to be working my nico and my
 

307
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,710
i'm going to be working my nico and my
coat of gosh primarily because those are

308
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
coat of gosh primarily because those are
 

309
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,629
coat of gosh primarily because those are
going to be my best chances to escape

310
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
going to be my best chances to escape
 

311
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,430
going to be my best chances to escape
this

312
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
this
 

313
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,150
this
now if i get in here and he's locked it

314
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
now if i get in here and he's locked it
 

315
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,510
now if i get in here and he's locked it
down and not moving at all and

316
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
down and not moving at all and
 

317
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,189
down and not moving at all and
understand i'm doing all this right now

318
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
understand i'm doing all this right now
 

319
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,390
understand i'm doing all this right now
just because i don't want to track the

320
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
just because i don't want to track the
 

321
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,590
just because i don't want to track the
camera around

322
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
camera around
 

323
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,270
camera around
but we're moving in this right because

324
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
but we're moving in this right because
 

325
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,629
but we're moving in this right because
he's going to be trying to come in and

326
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
he's going to be trying to come in and
 

327
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,390
he's going to be trying to come in and
get it with that other hand and i'm

328
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
get it with that other hand and i'm
 

329
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,670
get it with that other hand and i'm
going to be trying to get away from that

330
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
going to be trying to get away from that
 

331
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,029
going to be trying to get away from that
with that other hand so we're moving

332
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
with that other hand so we're moving
 

333
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,550
with that other hand so we're moving
around right now i'm just showing this

334
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
around right now i'm just showing this
 

335
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,029
around right now i'm just showing this
this way so you can see it but i've slid

336
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
this way so you can see it but i've slid
 

337
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,110
this way so you can see it but i've slid
up here and even with the mechanical

338
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
up here and even with the mechanical
 

339
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,790
up here and even with the mechanical
advantage he's totally locked out and

340
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
advantage he's totally locked out and
 

341
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,710
advantage he's totally locked out and
this is quite possible i just i still

342
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
this is quite possible i just i still
 

343
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,870
this is quite possible i just i still
can't get it right all right i have a

344
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
can't get it right all right i have a
 

345
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,350
can't get it right all right i have a
couple options to attack his hand one is

346
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
couple options to attack his hand one is
 

347
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,990
couple options to attack his hand one is
to go into any kind of yonkyo right so

348
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
to go into any kind of yonkyo right so
 

349
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,510
to go into any kind of yonkyo right so
meaning i could roll yonko and you can't

350
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
meaning i could roll yonko and you can't
 

351
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,110
meaning i could roll yonko and you can't
see it right now but i just rolled

352
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
see it right now but i just rolled
 

353
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,189
see it right now but i just rolled
yonkyo right up here on top of his

354
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
yonkyo right up here on top of his
 

355
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,590
yonkyo right up here on top of his
knuckle and so now when i grab and drive

356
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
knuckle and so now when i grab and drive
 

357
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,510
knuckle and so now when i grab and drive
into it i can put a ton of force right

358
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
into it i can put a ton of force right
 

359
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,270
into it i can put a ton of force right
into that knuckle makes him want to pull

360
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
into that knuckle makes him want to pull
 

361
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,950
into that knuckle makes him want to pull
his hand away quick now look it's not a

362
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
his hand away quick now look it's not a
 

363
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,790
his hand away quick now look it's not a
death grip but if it just hurts and it's

364
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
death grip but if it just hurts and it's
 

365
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,029
death grip but if it just hurts and it's
suddenly surprising natural reaction is

366
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
suddenly surprising natural reaction is
 

367
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,469
suddenly surprising natural reaction is
often to pull your hand out touch

368
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
often to pull your hand out touch
 

369
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,909
often to pull your hand out touch
something hot pull your hand back right

370
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
something hot pull your hand back right
 

371
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,070
something hot pull your hand back right
so so that is something i can go into

372
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
so so that is something i can go into
 

373
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,430
so so that is something i can go into
immediately so i could try yonko now i

374
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
immediately so i could try yonko now i
 

375
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,029
immediately so i could try yonko now i
could try my yonko there i could try it

376
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
could try my yonko there i could try it
 

377
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,629
could try my yonko there i could try it
on the metacarpals in the hand i might

378
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
on the metacarpals in the hand i might
 

379
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,070
on the metacarpals in the hand i might
be able to get to the thumb i might just

380
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
be able to get to the thumb i might just
 

381
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,510
be able to get to the thumb i might just
go to the wrist right but i can get

382
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
go to the wrist right but i can get
 

383
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,430
go to the wrist right but i can get
yonko anywhere in here and that's one

384
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
yonko anywhere in here and that's one
 

385
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,950
yonko anywhere in here and that's one
thing i'm going to try really quick can

386
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
thing i'm going to try really quick can
 

387
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,629
thing i'm going to try really quick can
i yonko him and see if he'll let go of

388
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
i yonko him and see if he'll let go of
 

389
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,870
i yonko him and see if he'll let go of
it now in addition to that i'm going to

390
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
it now in addition to that i'm going to
 

391
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,189
it now in addition to that i'm going to
try rokyo's especially if he's locked

392
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
try rokyo's especially if he's locked
 

393
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,350
try rokyo's especially if he's locked
out like this right so if he's locked

394
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
out like this right so if he's locked
 

395
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,550
out like this right so if he's locked
out like this i'm going to try to get in

396
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
out like this i'm going to try to get in
 

397
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,150
out like this i'm going to try to get in
there and get to the elbow and pop him

398
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
there and get to the elbow and pop him
 

399
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,990
there and get to the elbow and pop him
off with that rokyo and this works

400
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
off with that rokyo and this works
 

401
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,150
off with that rokyo and this works
perfectly with my idea of moving away

402
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
perfectly with my idea of moving away
 

403
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,070
perfectly with my idea of moving away
from that other hand coming in all right

404
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
from that other hand coming in all right
 

405
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,230
from that other hand coming in all right
now if i get in here and he bends his

406
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
now if i get in here and he bends his
 

407
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,270
now if i get in here and he bends his
arm i'm either going to get kodagaish or

408
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
arm i'm either going to get kodagaish or
 

409
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,909
arm i'm either going to get kodagaish or
shihonage depending on where he's at

410
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
shihonage depending on where he's at
 

411
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,670
shihonage depending on where he's at
right so both shionaga and the kotori

412
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
right so both shionaga and the kotori
 

413
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,510
right so both shionaga and the kotori
guys will come up when he pulls his arm

414
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
guys will come up when he pulls his arm
 

415
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,830
guys will come up when he pulls his arm
in like that if for some odd reason he

416
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
in like that if for some odd reason he
 

417
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,589
in like that if for some odd reason he
pulls his arm up high which could happen

418
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
pulls his arm up high which could happen
 

419
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,950
pulls his arm up high which could happen
right because maybe he felt that coming

420
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
right because maybe he felt that coming
 

421
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,110
right because maybe he felt that coming
on he didn't like it i have the nico

422
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
on he didn't like it i have the nico
 

423
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,990
on he didn't like it i have the nico
here and i have the sankyo here right so

424
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
here and i have the sankyo here right so
 

425
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,070
here and i have the sankyo here right so
both of those are a ton of power in that

426
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
both of those are a ton of power in that
 

427
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,150
both of those are a ton of power in that
and then also if we get close quarters

428
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
and then also if we get close quarters
 

429
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,150
and then also if we get close quarters
to that we'll get kokinage so let's say

430
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
to that we'll get kokinage so let's say
 

431
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,510
to that we'll get kokinage so let's say
we get in close like this and i can't

432
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
we get in close like this and i can't
 

433
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,430
we get in close like this and i can't
get those to work kokunage immediately

434
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
get those to work kokunage immediately
 

435
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,749
get those to work kokunage immediately
becomes available also in there juji

436
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
becomes available also in there juji
 

437
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,029
becomes available also in there juji
nage will become available because we're

438
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
nage will become available because we're
 

439
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,270
nage will become available because we're
here i hit the face and i drive in here

440
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
here i hit the face and i drive in here
 

441
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,950
here i hit the face and i drive in here
boom and there's my juji right there as

442
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
boom and there's my juji right there as
 

443
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,990
boom and there's my juji right there as
i drive this into him right so

444
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
i drive this into him right so
 

445
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,749
i drive this into him right so
the way i'm thinking of this progression

446
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
the way i'm thinking of this progression
 

447
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,990
the way i'm thinking of this progression
is the second i see him going to grab it

448
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
is the second i see him going to grab it
 

449
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,230
is the second i see him going to grab it
i want to move the joe into a position

450
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
i want to move the joe into a position
 

451
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,990
i want to move the joe into a position
that won't be beneficial to him those

452
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
that won't be beneficial to him those
 

453
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,909
that won't be beneficial to him those
basic positions are going to be kodagush

454
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
basic positions are going to be kodagush
 

455
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,589
basic positions are going to be kodagush
and nico and that's the way i'm working

456
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
and nico and that's the way i'm working
 

457
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,510
and nico and that's the way i'm working
now as long as i can do that so if he's

458
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
now as long as i can do that so if he's
 

459
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,870
now as long as i can do that so if he's
not resisting me that's what i'm going

460
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
not resisting me that's what i'm going
 

461
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,550
not resisting me that's what i'm going
to do right from where i'm at because i

462
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
to do right from where i'm at because i
 

463
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,629
to do right from where i'm at because i
don't want to reset this the second i

464
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
don't want to reset this the second i
 

465
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,469
don't want to reset this the second i
get resistance i'm going to slide my

466
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
get resistance i'm going to slide my
 

467
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,629
get resistance i'm going to slide my
hand in and start using my mechanical

468
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
hand in and start using my mechanical
 

469
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,469
hand in and start using my mechanical
advantage to help me all this is being

470
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
advantage to help me all this is being
 

471
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,350
advantage to help me all this is being
done away from him by the way and if i

472
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
