just the inward pair
 

187
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,110
just the inward pair
that's going to be this one

188
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
that's going to be this one
 

189
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,950
that's going to be this one
it goes out

all right
 

237
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,990
all right
whatever way he's parrying so he's doing

238
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
whatever way he's parrying so he's doing
 

239
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,189
whatever way he's parrying so he's doing
that perry's pairing to his right his

240
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
that perry's pairing to his right his
 

241
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,430
that perry's pairing to his right his
head will go to the left

242
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440

 

243
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,469

you see his head goes that way so you're

244
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
you see his head goes that way so you're
 

245
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,189
you see his head goes that way so you're
this is for those older your angle of

246
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
this is for those older your angle of
 

247
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,790
this is for those older your angle of
deflection

248
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
deflection
 

249
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,150
deflection
is contrary to your angle of deviation

250
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
is contrary to your angle of deviation
 

251
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,710
is contrary to your angle of deviation
so his angle deflection is going north

252
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
so his angle deflection is going north
 

253
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,909
so his angle deflection is going north
his head goes south you got it

254
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
his head goes south you got it
 

255

now they add in the double factor parry

280
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
now they add in the double factor parry
 

281
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,270
now they add in the double factor parry
so let's practice it again

282
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
so let's practice it again
 

283
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,230

00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
you go to the other side
 

289
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,830
you go to the other side
nope

290
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840

317
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:43,910

[Music]

318
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920

 

319
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,110

all right

all right
 

321
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,350
all right
so i'm going to first learn the

322
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
so i'm going to first learn the
 

323
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,910
so i'm going to first learn the
homolateral vector so that means i'm

324
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
homolateral vector so that means i'm
 

325
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,230
homolateral vector so that means i'm
going to step through

326
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
going to step through
 

327
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,310
going to step through
and just push this hand towards his face

328
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320

 

329
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,389

so start with your stepping foot in the

330
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
so start with your stepping foot in the
 

331
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,509
so start with your stepping foot in the
back

332
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
back
 

333
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,030
back

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
don't hand off
 

335
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,269
don't hand off
and he's gonna do that ferry

336
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279

 

337
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,590

maybe move down all the way inside

338
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600

 

339
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,790

do the other side

340
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800

 

341
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,630

he has to keep his eyes open

342
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640

 

343
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,870

he will hang white like that

344
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880

 

345
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,710

so he looks at it

346
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
so he looks at it
 

347
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,590
so he looks at it
gets used to it coming to his face

348
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
gets used to it coming to his face
 

349
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,470
gets used to it coming to his face
okay

350
