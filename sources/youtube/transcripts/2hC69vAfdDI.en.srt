hole

116

hole
 

117
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,690

you could have you could have

118
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:53,700
you could have you could have
 

119
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,009
you could have you could have
but in my experience

120
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:58,019

 

121
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,910

there is a passivity to iking

122
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
there is a passivity to iking
 

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,030
there is a passivity to iking
if more happens

124
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
if more happens
 

125
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,890
if more happens
as a result of something not happening

so to cultivate ID

128
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
so to cultivate ID
 

129
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,129
so to cultivate ID
is kind of weird

130
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:16,139

 

131
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,490

but I can't cultivate coffee

132
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,500
but I can't cultivate coffee
 

133
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,949
but I can't cultivate coffee
but in the cultivation of Coq the

134
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:21,959
but in the cultivation of Coq the
 

135
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,770
but in the cultivation of Coq the
cultivation of the young variant of

you're going to have to do I

140
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
you're going to have to do I
 

141
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,749
you're going to have to do I
cannot not happen

142
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:32,759
cannot not happen
 

143
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,850
cannot not happen
but there's another reason

144
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:34,860
but there's another reason
 

145
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,249
but there's another reason
for why you would have a cookie hole and

146
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:37,259
for why you would have a cookie hole and
 

147
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,550
for why you would have a cookie hole and
not an IP hole well first reason is you

148
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
not an IP hole well first reason is you
 

149
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,890
not an IP hole well first reason is you
you will have ipoid

150
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:42,900
you will have ipoid
 

151
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,850
you will have ipoid
right and then the second reason is Ike

152
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:46,860
right and then the second reason is Ike
 

153
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,650
right and then the second reason is Ike
no I.T hole because it happens past

154
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,660
no I.T hole because it happens past
 

155
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,530
no I.T hole because it happens past
e but the third reason is

156
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:54,540
e but the third reason is
 

157
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,030
e but the third reason is
that from a pedagogical point of view

158
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
that from a pedagogical point of view
 

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,270
that from a pedagogical point of view
what like what helps the beginner move

160
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
what like what helps the beginner move
 

161
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,490
what like what helps the beginner move
from no Coq no internal skills to having

162
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,500
from no Coq no internal skills to having
 

163
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,909
from no Coq no internal skills to having
those skills it is much easier to go

164
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:10,919
those skills it is much easier to go
 

165
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,450
those skills it is much easier to go
through Coq than to try to go through it

166
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:14,460
through Coq than to try to go through it
 

167
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,430
through Coq than to try to go through it
okay

168
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
okay
 

169
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,990
okay
so

170
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
so
 

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,790
so
that said

172
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:19,800
that said
 

173
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,529
that said
when it when it's not it's not sparring

174
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:24,539
when it when it's not it's not sparring
 

175
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,990
when it when it's not it's not sparring
it's not self-defense

176
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
it's not self-defense
 

177
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,710
it's not self-defense
it's not a risk grab defense

178
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
it's not a risk grab defense
 

179
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,390
it's not a risk grab defense
um

180
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
um
 

181

kind of pulled that thing out okay so

352
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
kind of pulled that thing out okay so
 

353
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,170
kind of pulled that thing out okay so
let's watch his Center

354
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,180
let's watch his Center
 

355
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,650
let's watch his Center
and uh you can go gradually but slow

356
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:51,660
and uh you can go gradually but slow
 

357
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,850
and uh you can go gradually but slow
and you can see that part right there

358
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:54,860
and you can see that part right there
 

359
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,550
and you can see that part right there
where this kind of caves around it okay

360
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
where this kind of caves around it okay
 

361
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,430
where this kind of caves around it okay
we'll do it again

362
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
we'll do it again
 

363
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,630
we'll do it again
right there

364
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
right there
 

365
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,630
right there
is what you want to look for

366
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
is what you want to look for
 

367
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,930
is what you want to look for
so I'll show you some contrasting things

368
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:08,940
so I'll show you some contrasting things
 

369
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,650
so I'll show you some contrasting things
a contrasting uh diff so what I'm not

370
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:12,660
a contrasting uh diff so what I'm not
 

371
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,550
a contrasting uh diff so what I'm not
doing is I'm not trying to create a lean

372
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
doing is I'm not trying to create a lean
 

373
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,930
doing is I'm not trying to create a lean
in his body by manipulating his line of

374
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
in his body by manipulating his line of
 

375
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,130
in his body by manipulating his line of
gravity

376
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,140
gravity
 

377
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,670

okay I'm not trying to take this hand

378
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
okay I'm not trying to take this hand
 

379
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,570
okay I'm not trying to take this hand
this way lift up his elbow and then just

380
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:29,580
this way lift up his elbow and then just
 

381
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,210
this way lift up his elbow and then just
lean his line of gravity outside his

382
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,220
lean his line of gravity outside his
 

383
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,730
lean his line of gravity outside his
face of support So if you watch his

384
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:34,740
face of support So if you watch his
 

385
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,449
face of support So if you watch his
Center and it just kind of

386
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:38,459
Center and it just kind of
 

387
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,550
Center and it just kind of
fills out

388
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
fills out
 

389
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,290
fills out
can you see that

390
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,300
can you see that
 

391
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,310
can you see that
okay

392
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:45,320

 

393
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,490

you can do the same arm techniques you

394
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,500
you can do the same arm techniques you
 

395
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,250
you can do the same arm techniques you
know I have a Yin arm out here right cut

396
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:52,260
know I have a Yin arm out here right cut
 

397
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,710
know I have a Yin arm out here right cut
over the top and I have a yam arm over

here can still have this elbow up but

400
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,200
here can still have this elbow up but
 

401
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,530
here can still have this elbow up but
something different happens to a center

402
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,540
something different happens to a center
 

403
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,350
something different happens to a center
so in this one he kind of rolls out of

404
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
so in this one he kind of rolls out of
 

405
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,930
so in this one he kind of rolls out of
his basic support and on the other one

406
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:08,940

 

407
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,069

525
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,509

so I I didn't do it

526
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
so I I didn't do it
 

527
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,150
so I I didn't do it
there's no initial training drill the

528
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
there's no initial training drill the
 

529
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,329
there's no initial training drill the
bar is not on the uprights

530
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:23,339
bar is not on the uprights
 

531
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,690
bar is not on the uprights
okay or I do start it and when I feel it

532
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:26,700
okay or I do start it and when I feel it
 

533
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,509
okay or I do start it and when I feel it
I now went limp again

534
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
I now went limp again
 

535
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,210
I now went limp again
it's loose again

536
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:32,220
it's loose again
 

537
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,810
it's loose again
so I have that relationship

538
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:35,820
so I have that relationship
 

539
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,470
so I have that relationship
and my goal is UK is to keep that

540
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,480
and my goal is UK is to keep that
 

541
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,769
and my goal is UK is to keep that
relationship so that he

542
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:42,779
relationship so that he
 

543
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,569
relationship so that he
can send that energy down

544
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:47,579

 

545
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,610

I go

546
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:49,620
I go
 

547
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,189
I go
I just look escape from that

548
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:52,199
I just look escape from that
 

549
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,689
I just look escape from that
relationship

550
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:53,699
relationship
 

551
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,730
relationship
if you watched the energy that he's

552
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:55,740
if you watched the energy that he's
 

553
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,129
if you watched the energy that he's
projecting up to move my go ahead do it

554
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:58,139
projecting up to move my go ahead do it
 

555
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,590
projecting up to move my go ahead do it
slow the energy that's coming back into

556
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:00,600
slow the energy that's coming back into
 

557
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,110
slow the energy that's coming back into
my body right there

558
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
my body right there
 

559
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,370
my body right there
I will absorb in my arms

560
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:07,380

 

561
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,449

okay now the bar on the bench press all

562
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:11,459
okay now the bar on the bench press all
 

563
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,670
okay now the bar on the bench press all
of a sudden got all rubbery it's not

564
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
of a sudden got all rubbery it's not
 

565
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,090
of a sudden got all rubbery it's not
working for my skill okay so to set the

566
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,100
working for my skill okay so to set the
 

567
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,009
working for my skill okay so to set the
drill up

568
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:19,019
drill up
 

569
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,350
drill up
you establish the center to Center

570
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
you establish the center to Center
 

571
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,230
you establish the center to Center
relationship that means my Center is in

572
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
relationship that means my Center is in
 

573
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,350
relationship that means my Center is in
my hands and my energy is going into his

574
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
my hands and my energy is going into his
 

575
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,590
my hands and my energy is going into his
Center down he will

576
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,600
Center down he will
 

577
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,470
Center down he will
feel that aim it back into me and there

578
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480
feel that aim it back into me and there
 

579
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,250
feel that aim it back into me and there
is

580
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,260
is
 

581
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,030
is
so to speak the initial conflict that

582
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
so to speak the initial conflict that
 

583
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,689
so to speak the initial conflict that
the Jujitsu will reconcile okay it will

584
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:41,699
the Jujitsu will reconcile okay it will
 

585
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:45,189
the Jujitsu will reconcile okay it will
reconcile it internally though

586
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
reconcile it internally though
 

587
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,430
reconcile it internally though
on top

588
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440

 

589
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,870

okay let us get there

590
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880

 

591
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,389

so

592
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399

 

593
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,110

one thing was already said

594
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,120
one thing was already said
 

595
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,470
one thing was already said
and that is that when I project that I

596
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
and that is that when I project that I
 

597
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,810
and that is that when I project that I
don't reject into your shoulders

598
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:08,820
don't reject into your shoulders
 

599
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,670
don't reject into your shoulders
I'm not projecting here

600
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm not projecting here
 

601
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,290
I'm not projecting here
okay

602
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:12,300
okay
 

603
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,290
okay
so someone who might not have ever

604
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,300
so someone who might not have ever
 

605
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,990
so someone who might not have ever
experienced this

606
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
experienced this
 

607
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,650
experienced this
tries to figure it out with the tools

608
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,660
tries to figure it out with the tools
 

609
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,470
tries to figure it out with the tools
that they have okay and for example

610
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
that they have okay and for example
 

611
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,009
that they have okay and for example
if they are doing Coq whole and they're

612
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,019
if they are doing Coq whole and they're
 

613
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,310
if they are doing Coq whole and they're
practicing a throw

614
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
practicing a throw
 

615
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,430
practicing a throw
this kind of throw

616
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
this kind of throw
 

617
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,889
this kind of throw
or

618
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:39,899
or
 

619
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,310
or
by extension what is that that's just a

620
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:43,320
by extension what is that that's just a
 

621
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,030
by extension what is that that's just a
manipulation of your uh

622
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
manipulation of your uh
 

623
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,790
manipulation of your uh
your frame let's say or your posture

624
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:49,800
your frame let's say or your posture
 

625
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,069
your frame let's say or your posture
such that your line of Gravity Falls

626
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
such that your line of Gravity Falls
 

627
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,470
such that your line of Gravity Falls
outside your base of support and then

628
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
outside your base of support and then
 

629
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,210
outside your base of support and then
you will tilt over

630
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,220
you will tilt over
 

631
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,449
you will tilt over
yeah I know

632
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:01,459

 

633
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,409

are you all right

634
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:05,419

 

635
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,289

any any of those versions so you know I

636
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,299
any any of those versions so you know I
 

637
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,669
any any of those versions so you know I
can hear using and then I turn

638
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679

 

639
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,049

it is an external manipulation of her

640
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:18,059
it is an external manipulation of her
 

641
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,689
it is an external manipulation of her
shape such that her line of Gravity

642
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:20,699
shape such that her line of Gravity
 

643
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,030
shape such that her line of Gravity
Falls outside her face of support and

644
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,040
Falls outside her face of support and
 

645
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,490
Falls outside her face of support and
she is her balance which she then

646
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:25,500
she is her balance which she then
 

647
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,570
she is her balance which she then
recovers with the goal okay

648
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:29,580
recovers with the goal okay
 

649
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,669
recovers with the goal okay
um

650
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679

 

651
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,150

another external manipulation is the one

652
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,160
another external manipulation is the one
 

653
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,730
another external manipulation is the one

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
have to find my Center find my Center
 

661
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,029

another one
is

696
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
is
 

697
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,310
is
when I go to push so I'm not pushing

698
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
when I go to push so I'm not pushing
 

699
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,570
when I go to push so I'm not pushing
like this

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:41,580
like this
 

701
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,430
like this
and you're not supposed to push back

702
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
and you're not supposed to push back
 

703
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,650
and you're not supposed to push back
like that

704
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:45,660
like that
 

705
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,490
like that
if I pick up the energy

706
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:49,500
if I pick up the energy
 

707
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,470
if I pick up the energy
you will never

708
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:51,480
you will never
 

709
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,330
you will never
be able to do it

710
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:53,340
be able to do it
 

711
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,130
be able to do it
okay if you're doing shoulder to

712
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,140
okay if you're doing shoulder to
 

713
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,770
okay if you're doing shoulder to
shoulder push at external manipulation

714
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:57,780
shoulder push at external manipulation
 

715
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,870
shoulder push at external manipulation
okay so we go and I

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880

 

717
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,510

the less you can do with it it just
 

753
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,190
the less you can do with it it just
overpowers you okay so uh he's gonna get

00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,200
overpowers you okay so uh he's gonna get
 

755
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,049
overpowers you okay so uh he's gonna get

758
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,000
energy and you'll see like let's say
 

759
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,970
energy and you'll see like let's say
like medium energy you can see look at

760
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:04,980
like medium energy you can see look at
 

761
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,010
like medium energy you can see look at
how much movement that was

how much movement that was
 

763
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,850
how much movement that was
that's still a lot of movement

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,049
when they talk about internal skills so
daito U is doing something totally

872
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:39,059
daito U is doing something totally
 

873
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,950
daito U is doing something totally
different

874
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960

 

875
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,370

for them they believe or they pause it

876
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,380
for them they believe or they pause it
 

877
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,190
for them they believe or they pause it
or they suggest

878
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
or they suggest
 

879
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,570
or they suggest
that what they're doing is different

880
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:53,580
that what they're doing is different
 

881
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,810
that what they're doing is different
by which they mean better

882
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:56,820
by which they mean better
 

883
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,190
by which they mean better
so

884
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,200
so
 

885
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,289
so
yes there might be some Chinese

886
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:00,299
yes there might be some Chinese
 

887
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,330
yes there might be some Chinese

889
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,570
influences or there might be some uh uh

891
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,490

892
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:10,500
same problem
 

893
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,909

but there's an air that is better and I

894
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
but there's an air that is better and I
 

895
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,950
but there's an air that is better and I
would say it's not

896
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:15,960
would say it's not
 

897
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,649
would say it's not
I would ignore completely what that

898
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:18,659
I would ignore completely what that
 

899
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,590
I would ignore completely what that

so far as you guys were going we could

956
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:58,260
so far as you guys were going we could

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,269
so far as you guys were going we could
see that many of you thought koku is

958
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:02,279
see that many of you thought koku is
 

959
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,370
see that many of you thought koku is
just sending energy back up the

960
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:04,380
just sending energy back up the
 

961
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,830
just sending energy back up the
shoulders and kind of

962
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:06,840
shoulders and kind of
 

963
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,730
shoulders and kind of
taking advantage that he had

964
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:09,740
taking advantage that he had
 

965
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:17,870
taking advantage that he had
rigidity in his arms but it's not that

966
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:17,880

 

967
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,430

so let us continue to look more

968
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
so let us continue to look more
 

969
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,390
so let us continue to look more
into what it is not okay so

970
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
into what it is not okay so
 

971
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,769
into what it is not okay so
um

972
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:27,779
um
 

973
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,190
um
I described it and and here I am telling

974
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
I described it and and here I am telling
 

975
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,310
I described it and and here I am telling
you how I'm describing it is equally

976
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
you how I'm describing it is equally
 

977
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,510
you how I'm describing it is equally
poetic meaning as a new Pia it both

978
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:38,520
poetic meaning as a new Pia it both
 

979
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,930
poetic meaning as a new Pia it both
points to what you're trying to do but

980
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:41,940
points to what you're trying to do but
 

981
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,409
points to what you're trying to do but
as a new Paya is also an obstacle to

982
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:45,419
as a new Paya is also an obstacle to
 

983
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,070
as a new Paya is also an obstacle to
what you want to try to do okay

984
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,080
what you want to try to do okay
 

985
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,210
what you want to try to do okay
which means it's both true and not true

986
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,220
which means it's both true and not true
 

987
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,570
which means it's both true and not true
so the poetic that I use

988
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:56,580
so the poetic that I use
 

989
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,169
so the poetic that I use
is that his energy is going to go down

990
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:00,179
is that his energy is going to go down
 

991
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,590
is that his energy is going to go down
into my body and down onto the ground

992
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
into my body and down onto the ground
 

993
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,769
into my body and down onto the ground
that's the imagery that you're using

994
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:06,779
that's the imagery that you're using
 

995
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,710
that's the imagery that you're using
okay

996
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:09,720

 

997
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,169

um

998
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:12,179

 

999
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,390

let's see

1000
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,400
let's see
 

1001
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,390
let's see
so some might look at this and go no

1002
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,400
so some might look at this and go no
 

1003
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,990
so some might look at this and go no
this is just a skeletal alignment and a

1004
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,000
this is just a skeletal alignment and a
 

1005
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,850
this is just a skeletal alignment and a
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it

1006
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:25,860
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it
 

1007
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,190
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it
failed us when the guy pushed really

1008
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,200
failed us when the guy pushed really
 

1009
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,690
failed us when the guy pushed really
hard

1010
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:29,700
hard
 

1011
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,310
hard
so

1012
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,320
so
 

1013
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,250
so
what I described poetically is that

1014
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,260
what I described poetically is that
 

1015
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,850
what I described poetically is that
energy is going into me and going down

1016
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,860
energy is going into me and going down
 

1017
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,190
energy is going into me and going down
there's nothing in that that says I need

1018
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,200
there's nothing in that that says I need
 

1019
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,789
there's nothing in that that says I need
to have good skeletal Alignment good

1020
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:43,799
to have good skeletal Alignment good
 

1021
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,730
to have good skeletal Alignment good
posture or anything at all do you

1022
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:46,740
posture or anything at all do you
 

1023
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,090
posture or anything at all do you
understand okay so for example if he's

1024
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,100
understand okay so for example if he's
 

1025
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,630
understand okay so for example if he's
pushing here you you can look at well

1026
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:53,640
pushing here you you can look at well
 

1027
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,649
pushing here you you can look at well
that you have skeletal alignment and uh

1028
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:57,659
that you have skeletal alignment and uh
 

1029
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,350
that you have skeletal alignment and uh
you're just have sound body mechanics

1030
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,360
you're just have sound body mechanics
 

1031
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,409
you're just have sound body mechanics
okay but there's some problems here my

1032
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:03,419
okay but there's some problems here my
 

1033
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,610
okay but there's some problems here my
go ahead and keep pushing my arm is not

1034
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:07,620
go ahead and keep pushing my arm is not
 

1035
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,390
go ahead and keep pushing my arm is not
uh rigid so this this would make sense

1036
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:11,400
uh rigid so this this would make sense
 

1037
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,330
uh rigid so this this would make sense
to a secular materialist but this starts

1038
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:14,340

you want to practice
 

1537
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,069
you want to practice
a releasing skill okay and you have to

1538
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:31,079
a releasing skill okay and you have to
 

1539
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,670
a releasing skill okay and you have to
start from a place of tension first

1540
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:34,680
start from a place of tension first
 

1541
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,170
start from a place of tension first
okay I I think of it as like uh a game

1542
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,180
okay I I think of it as like uh a game
 

1543
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,470

where our Jenga

1544
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
where our Jenga
 

1545
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,190
where our Jenga
you're gonna take tiles away

1546
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,200
you're gonna take tiles away
 

1547
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,069
you're gonna take tiles away
that are not necessary for the tower to

1548
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:49,079
that are not necessary for the tower to
 

1549
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,550
that are not necessary for the tower to
maintain its integrity

1550
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560

 

1551
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,670

so first you have all the tiles in place

1552
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
so first you have all the tiles in place

you're trying to take energy off okay so
 

1989
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,069
you're trying to take energy off okay so
the downside for you though is you're

1990

the downside for you though is you're
 

1991

the downside for you though is you're
wasting half of your training
