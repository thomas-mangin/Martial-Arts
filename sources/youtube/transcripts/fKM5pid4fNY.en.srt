the arm is pressing
 

527
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,310
the arm is pressing
and the head is pressing it's like a

you perhaps can see this but it's a it's

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
a triangle and i could always
 

539
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,550
a triangle and i could always
as we know all triangular circular

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
as we know all triangular circular
 

541
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,670
as we know all triangular circular
and square so

542
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
and square so
 

543
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,750

i wanted to make this book only

544
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
i wanted to make this book only
 

545
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,350
i wanted to make this book only
technical

546
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
technical
 

547
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,910
technical
but the feedback i've got over the years

548
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
but the feedback i've got over the years
 

549
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,430
but the feedback i've got over the years
is how much people have enjoyed

550
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
is how much people have enjoyed
 

551
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,590
is how much people have enjoyed
listening to my story

552
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
listening to my story
 

553
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,110
listening to my story
of how i got into aikido and they

554
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
of how i got into aikido and they
 

555
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,790
of how i got into aikido and they
all find it fascinating very rarely do i

556
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
all find it fascinating very rarely do i
 

557
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,990
all find it fascinating very rarely do i
get anybody talk about

558
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
get anybody talk about
 

559
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,230
get anybody talk about
the technical so this led me to make

560
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
the technical so this led me to make
 

561
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,949
the technical so this led me to make
a second book

562
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959

 

563
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,190

i thought once you get the technical

564
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
i thought once you get the technical
 

565
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,030
i thought once you get the technical
they're not asking about the technique

566
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
they're not asking about the technique
 

567
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,230
they're not asking about the technique
so if they're not asking the technical

568
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
so if they're not asking the technical
 

569
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,629
so if they're not asking the technical
they're just interested in my story

570
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
they're just interested in my story
 

571
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,550
they're just interested in my story
perhaps i should tell i should think

572
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
perhaps i should tell i should think
 

573
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,110
perhaps i should tell i should think
about you know this second book

574
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
about you know this second book
 

575
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,829
about you know this second book
the second book i'll just take a bit to

576
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
the second book i'll just take a bit to
 

577
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,550
the second book i'll just take a bit to
the

578
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
the
 

579
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,269
the
camera but keeping the mind of a child

580
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
camera but keeping the mind of a child
 

581
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,230
camera but keeping the mind of a child
and this led me to think back of when i

582
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
and this led me to think back of when i
 

583
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,949
and this led me to think back of when i
had this notion that cytosensei

584
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
had this notion that cytosensei
 

585
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,509
had this notion that cytosensei
was doing the weapons perfectly forward

586
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
was doing the weapons perfectly forward
 

587
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,350
was doing the weapons perfectly forward
and then he would do them perfectly

588
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
and then he would do them perfectly
 

589
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,190
and then he would do them perfectly
backwards

590
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
backwards
 

591
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,069
backwards
and i realized that only a child thinks

592
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
and i realized that only a child thinks
 

593
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,190
and i realized that only a child thinks
like that

594
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
like that
 

595
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,550
like that
you know a child sees clear

596
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
you know a child sees clear
 

597
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,269
you know a child sees clear
thinking if you say to a seven-year-old

598

child or five-year-old child come on

600
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040

child or five-year-old child come on
we've got to go

602
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
we've got to go
 

603
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,629
we've got to go
we've got five minutes they don't know

604
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
we've got five minutes they don't know
 

605
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,790
we've got five minutes they don't know
what five minutes is they don't they're

606
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
what five minutes is they don't they're
 

607
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,629
what five minutes is they don't they're
not run on time

608

their world's not like an adult
 

611
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,949
their world's not like an adult
so this second book was developed

612
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
so this second book was developed
 

613
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,710
so this second book was developed
really for those who trans

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,030
can become a piece
then you'll find that the mat time is

666
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
then you'll find that the mat time is
 

667
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,790
then you'll find that the mat time is
much more precious

668
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
much more precious
 

669
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,990

start
 

673
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,430
start
looking at the aikido that i believe

674
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
looking at the aikido that i believe
 

675
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,550
looking at the aikido that i believe
is where aikido starts not

676

is where aikido starts not
 

677
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,710
is where aikido starts not
at the beginning where we wanted to do

678
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
