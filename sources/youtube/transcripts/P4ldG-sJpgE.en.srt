Series in there so I think you need to

14
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,240
Series in there so I think you need to
 

15
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,710
Series in there so I think you need to
know everything from sh minucci because

16
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
know everything from sh minucci because
 

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,470
know everything from sh minucci because
I think you could really probably just

18
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:23,480
I think you could really probably just
 

19
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,830
I think you could really probably just
study the shanci series and and come

20
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
study the shanci series and and come
 

21
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,550
study the shanci series and and come
pretty close to understanding the basics

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,560
pretty close to understanding the basics
 

23
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,429

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,550
on that way if something's coming up
behind me someone's coming up behind me

160
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:51,560
behind me someone's coming up behind me
 

161
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,750
behind me someone's coming up behind me
or I need to change directions or

162
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,760
or I need to change directions or
 

163
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,350
or I need to change directions or
whatever the sulto war is going to make

164
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,360
whatever the sulto war is going to make
 

165
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,190
whatever the sulto war is going to make
a ton of sense and I think you know Su

166
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
a ton of sense and I think you know Su
 

167
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,630
a ton of sense and I think you know Su
is something that we see in iido that a

168
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
is something that we see in iido that a
 

169
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,030
is something that we see in iido that a
lot of people who do sport martial arts

170
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,040
lot of people who do sport martial arts
 

171
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,670
lot of people who do sport martial arts
go well that's a stupid movement why do

172
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
go well that's a stupid movement why do
 

173
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,149
go well that's a stupid movement why do
they practice that well because sport

174
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,159
they practice that well because sport
 

175
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,949
they practice that well because sport
people only have one person they're ever

176
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
people only have one person they're ever
 

177
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,869
people only have one person they're ever
working on right so if you're in a

178
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
working on right so if you're in a
 

179
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,470
working on right so if you're in a
situation where someone's coming behind

180
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
situation where someone's coming behind
 

181
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,309
situation where someone's coming behind
you you're going to have to do this kind

182
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
you you're going to have to do this kind
 

183
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,309
you you're going to have to do this kind
of action all the time super super

184
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
of action all the time super super
 

185
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,229
of action all the time super super
useful to do that kind of action all

186
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
useful to do that kind of action all
 

187
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,190
useful to do that kind of action all
right so those are going to be my two

188
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,200
right so those are going to be my two
 

189
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,550
right so those are going to be my two
primary ideas from that so let's talk

190
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
primary ideas from that so let's talk
 

191
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,149
primary ideas from that so let's talk
first about the soam Mori because we get

192
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
first about the soam Mori because we get
 

193
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,149
first about the soam Mori because we get
more classic iido techniques from the

194
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
more classic iido techniques from the
 

195
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,270
more classic iido techniques from the
soore from the Ed we pretty much get Ed

196
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
soore from the Ed we pretty much get Ed
 

197
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,030
soore from the Ed we pretty much get Ed
nag um or a failure of EDI which leads

198
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,040
nag um or a failure of EDI which leads
 

199
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,630
nag um or a failure of EDI which leads
to soami and let me explain what I mean

200
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
to soami and let me explain what I mean
 

201
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,910
to soami and let me explain what I mean
by that if I'm trying to get behind Josh

202
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
by that if I'm trying to get behind Josh
 

203
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,429
by that if I'm trying to get behind Josh
and he starts turning turning turning

204
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,439
and he starts turning turning turning
 

205
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,869
and he starts turning turning turning
turning turning we're going to get in

206
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
turning turning we're going to get in
 

207
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,429
turning turning we're going to get in
this this speed the speed race right so

208
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:37,439
this this speed the speed race right so
 

209
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,710
this this speed the speed race right so
we just call that a race not a speed

210
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
we just call that a race not a speed
 

211
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,589
we just call that a race not a speed
race but we're gonna get in this race

212
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:40,599
race but we're gonna get in this race
 

213
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,070
race but we're gonna get in this race
right if Josh is faster than me he's

214
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
right if Josh is faster than me he's
 

215
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,949
right if Josh is faster than me he's
gonna get Ed me if I'm faster than Josh

216
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
gonna get Ed me if I'm faster than Josh
 

217
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,630
gonna get Ed me if I'm faster than Josh
I'm Gonna Get Ed me right so if I'm

218
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm Gonna Get Ed me right so if I'm
 

219
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,390
I'm Gonna Get Ed me right so if I'm
shooting EDI and Josh starts turning

220
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
shooting EDI and Josh starts turning
 

221
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,910
shooting EDI and Josh starts turning
with me it's who's faster right now if

222
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
with me it's who's faster right now if
 

223
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,550
with me it's who's faster right now if
I'm faster I'd just push through and I'd

224
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm faster I'd just push through and I'd
 

225
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,789
I'm faster I'd just push through and I'd
get Ed or Ed nag um but if he's faster

226
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
get Ed or Ed nag um but if he's faster
 

227
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,630
get Ed or Ed nag um but if he's faster
he's going to get behind me so the suto

228
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:57,640
he's going to get behind me so the suto
 

229
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,350
he's going to get behind me so the suto
moari is a trick to keep him from

230
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360
moari is a trick to keep him from
 

231
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,190
moari is a trick to keep him from
getting the Ed position the reason is

232
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,200
getting the Ed position the reason is
 

233
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,710
getting the Ed position the reason is
because I can turn faster in a smaller

234
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
because I can turn faster in a smaller
 

235
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,830
because I can turn faster in a smaller
space right so look if Josh comes to my

236
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
space right so look if Josh comes to my
 

237
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,789
space right so look if Josh comes to my
back right now he's got to travel that

238
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:09,799
back right now he's got to travel that
 

239
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,429
back right now he's got to travel that
far okay in order to me to keep my back

240
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:12,439
far okay in order to me to keep my back
 

241
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,910
far okay in order to me to keep my back
away all I have to do is turn this much

242
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:14,920
away all I have to do is turn this much
 

243
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,469
away all I have to do is turn this much
right so I'm turning way less so as Josh

244
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
right so I'm turning way less so as Josh
 

245
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,830
right so I'm turning way less so as Josh
is coming to my back if I turn this way

246
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:18,840
is coming to my back if I turn this way
 

247
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,830
is coming to my back if I turn this way
I get I'll get the suore before he gets

248
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
I get I'll get the suore before he gets
 

249
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,189
I get I'll get the suore before he gets
the edia and I made a whole video

250
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
the edia and I made a whole video
 

251
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,270
the edia and I made a whole video
talking about this um what to do off of

252
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,280
talking about this um what to do off of
 

253
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,150
talking about this um what to do off of
failed EDI I think it's on the YouTube

254
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
failed EDI I think it's on the YouTube
 

255
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,590
failed EDI I think it's on the YouTube
videos um talking about that whole

256
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
videos um talking about that whole
 

257
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,350
videos um talking about that whole
series but the shui appears a lot or

258
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
series but the shui appears a lot or
 

259
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,590
series but the shui appears a lot or
sorry the sorei appears a lot because of

260
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
sorry the sorei appears a lot because of
 

261
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,870
sorry the sorei appears a lot because of
that reason all right now what are our

262
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
that reason all right now what are our
 

263
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,270
that reason all right now what are our
go-to techniques well our biggest iido

264
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,280
go-to techniques well our biggest iido
 

265
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,510
go-to techniques well our biggest iido
go-to technique is probably the kotay

266
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
go-to technique is probably the kotay
 

267
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,830
go-to technique is probably the kotay
now that kind of makes sense if I have

268
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
now that kind of makes sense if I have
 

269
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,430
now that kind of makes sense if I have
the weapon in my hand because as he

270
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
the weapon in my hand because as he
 

271
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,590
the weapon in my hand because as he
comes towards me I control this hand and

272
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
comes towards me I control this hand and
 

273
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,350
comes towards me I control this hand and
I attack him here right so so that makes

274
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,360
I attack him here right so so that makes
 

275
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,749
I attack him here right so so that makes
kind of a fair amount of sense that way

276
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:52,759
kind of a fair amount of sense that way
 

277
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,710
kind of a fair amount of sense that way
if he has the weapon it makes a fair

278
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
if he has the weapon it makes a fair
 

279
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,469
if he has the weapon it makes a fair
amount of sense so meaning I'm running

280
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
amount of sense so meaning I'm running
 

281
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,590
amount of sense so meaning I'm running
the Hell by and he tries to hit me boom

282
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:58,600
the Hell by and he tries to hit me boom
 

283
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,270
the Hell by and he tries to hit me boom
and I come in here this gives me the

284
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,280
and I come in here this gives me the
 

285
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,029
and I come in here this gives me the
disarm with kodish and and we know

286
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:02,039
disarm with kodish and and we know
 

287
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,510
disarm with kodish and and we know
that's a super viable technique because

288
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,520
that's a super viable technique because
 

289
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,950
that's a super viable technique because
uh I just posted Maya doing a doing it

290
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
uh I just posted Maya doing a doing it
 

291
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,870
uh I just posted Maya doing a doing it
live so it's totally a possible

292
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
live so it's totally a possible
 

293
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,990
live so it's totally a possible
technique um it it can totally come off

294
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
technique um it it can totally come off
 

295
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,749
technique um it it can totally come off
so there are reasons that could appear

296
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
so there are reasons that could appear
 

297
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,909
so there are reasons that could appear
when I get to the sorei position if he's

298
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:16,919
when I get to the sorei position if he's
 

299
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,150
when I get to the sorei position if he's
coming in that kodish happens and I can

300
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160
coming in that kodish happens and I can
 

301
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,309
coming in that kodish happens and I can
use the knife in this way but I think

302
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:21,319
use the knife in this way but I think
 

303
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,390
use the knife in this way but I think
something that people forget about is I

304
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,400
something that people forget about is I
 

305
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,670
something that people forget about is I
can also cross strike this way right so

306
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
can also cross strike this way right so
 

307
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,430
can also cross strike this way right so
I don't have to keep holding on to this

308
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
I don't have to keep holding on to this
 

309
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,189
I don't have to keep holding on to this
this this if he doesn't have a weapon in

310
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
this this if he doesn't have a weapon in
 

311
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,670
this this if he doesn't have a weapon in
it I can just let go and hit him this

312
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:32,680
it I can just let go and hit him this
 

313
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,390
it I can just let go and hit him this
way so if Josh is trying to come around

314
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
way so if Josh is trying to come around
 

315
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,469
way so if Josh is trying to come around
to me just going here boom is a really

316
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
to me just going here boom is a really
 

317
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,670
to me just going here boom is a really
really good idea now that sets up for

318
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:38,680
really good idea now that sets up for
 

319
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,790
really good idea now that sets up for
all the katam manucci stuff now I know

320
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
all the katam manucci stuff now I know
 

321
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,870
all the katam manucci stuff now I know
I'm not in the katam manucci position as

322
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm not in the katam manucci position as
 

323
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,350
I'm not in the katam manucci position as
I come around in essence I'm in the

324
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
I come around in essence I'm in the
 

325
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,189
I come around in essence I'm in the
katam manucci position right so that

326
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
katam manucci position right so that
 

327
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,510
katam manucci position right so that
gives us all the katam manucci

328
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,520
gives us all the katam manucci
 

329
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,710
gives us all the katam manucci
techniques from here okay what else it

330
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
techniques from here okay what else it
 

331
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,830
techniques from here okay what else it
gives me from here if he were to choose

332
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:52,840
gives me from here if he were to choose
 

333
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,350
gives me from here if he were to choose
to grab this hand is it gives me juji

334
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
to grab this hand is it gives me juji
 

335
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,070
to grab this hand is it gives me juji
nag now if he had the weapon you can see

336
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
nag now if he had the weapon you can see
 

337
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,909
nag now if he had the weapon you can see
that I'm here and if he's coming around

338
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
that I'm here and if he's coming around
 

339
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,870
that I'm here and if he's coming around
too fast I could switch off boom and I

340
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:01,880
too fast I could switch off boom and I
 

341
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,350
too fast I could switch off boom and I
get the juji nag if I have the weapon

342
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
get the juji nag if I have the weapon
 

343
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,350
get the juji nag if I have the weapon
and he hasn't grabbed me yet and I come

344
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,360
and he hasn't grabbed me yet and I come
 

345
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,230
and he hasn't grabbed me yet and I come
this way he is going to um grab me there

346
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
this way he is going to um grab me there
 

347
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,790
this way he is going to um grab me there
and I can grab this hand up boom and

348
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
and I can grab this hand up boom and
 

349
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,070
and I can grab this hand up boom and
juji nag it if I've switched hands when

350
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
juji nag it if I've switched hands when
 

351
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,430
juji nag it if I've switched hands when
I hit him which is not a bad idea

352
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
I hit him which is not a bad idea
 

353
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,270
I hit him which is not a bad idea
because now I'm in a defended position

354
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
because now I'm in a defended position
 

355
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,510
because now I'm in a defended position
as I come to get him with this if he

356
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,520
as I come to get him with this if he
 

357
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,629
as I come to get him with this if he
grabs I end up in the juji nag position

358
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
grabs I end up in the juji nag position
 

359
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,870
grabs I end up in the juji nag position
so juji nag off of shanci comes up all

360
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:23,880
so juji nag off of shanci comes up all
 

361
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,710
so juji nag off of shanci comes up all
the time when we're hitting with the

362
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:25,720
the time when we're hitting with the
 

363
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,189
the time when we're hitting with the
near side right so what I mean by that

364
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,199
near side right so what I mean by that
 

365
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,629
near side right so what I mean by that
is I could hit with the far side and I

366
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
is I could hit with the far side and I
 

367
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,469
is I could hit with the far side and I
can also hit with the near side so if I

368
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
can also hit with the near side so if I
 

369
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,629
can also hit with the near side so if I
hit with the near side we're going to

370
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:33,639
hit with the near side we're going to
 

371
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,430
hit with the near side we're going to
get juji because that hand naturally

372
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
get juji because that hand naturally
 

373
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,670
get juji because that hand naturally
come to protect him and he's in a

374
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:36,680
come to protect him and he's in a
 

375
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,510
come to protect him and he's in a
crossed position so juji nag will appear

376
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
crossed position so juji nag will appear
 

377
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,189
crossed position so juji nag will appear
all the time from that okay now in the

378
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:42,199
all the time from that okay now in the
 

379
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,710
all the time from that okay now in the
suore and I think I can only do one more

380
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:43,720
suore and I think I can only do one more
 

381
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,790
suore and I think I can only do one more
in this video because I've talked so

382
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
in this video because I've talked so
 

383
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,749
in this video because I've talked so
much but so I'm here in this position

384
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
much but so I'm here in this position
 

385
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,830
much but so I'm here in this position
now if Josh doesn't like this position

386
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
now if Josh doesn't like this position
 

387
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,790
now if Josh doesn't like this position
he's going to whip his arm around it

388
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:51,800
he's going to whip his arm around it
 

389
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,390
he's going to whip his arm around it
like that now when he does that my

390
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,400
like that now when he does that my
 

391
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,350
like that now when he does that my
initial reaction should always be to hit

392
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
initial reaction should always be to hit
 

393
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,589
initial reaction should always be to hit
at the inside right so if I have an

394
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:00,599
at the inside right so if I have an
 

395
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,070
at the inside right so if I have an
opening here right so there's an opening

396
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
opening here right so there's an opening
 

397
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,070
opening here right so there's an opening
and Josh comes around that and now I

398
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
and Josh comes around that and now I
 

399
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,749
and Josh comes around that and now I
have an opening here I should always hit

400
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
have an opening here I should always hit
 

401
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,110
have an opening here I should always hit
in that and I should probably always hit

402
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
in that and I should probably always hit
 

403
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,909
in that and I should probably always hit
and triangle my hand's always going to

404
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:08,919
and triangle my hand's always going to
 

405
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,110
and triangle my hand's always going to
go there for sure I might eat e me but a

406
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
go there for sure I might eat e me but a
 

407
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,070
go there for sure I might eat e me but a
lot of times I'm going to make a

408
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
lot of times I'm going to make a
 

409
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,550
lot of times I'm going to make a
triangle in that and this is just to

410
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
triangle in that and this is just to
 

411
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,230
triangle in that and this is just to
keep him from getting me right away so

412
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
keep him from getting me right away so
 

413
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,390
keep him from getting me right away so
if he whips his hand around my hand

414
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
if he whips his hand around my hand
 

415
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,230
if he whips his hand around my hand
should be going in here now if he

416
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
should be going in here now if he
 

417
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,150
should be going in here now if he
doesn't like my hand in his face here he

418
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
doesn't like my hand in his face here he
 

419
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,830
doesn't like my hand in his face here he
could duck under it right and you see

420
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
could duck under it right and you see
 

421
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,029
could duck under it right and you see
that in wrestling all the time it's

422
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
that in wrestling all the time it's
 

423
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,309
that in wrestling all the time it's
called the duck under now if as he goes

424
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:27,319
called the duck under now if as he goes
 

425
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,070
called the duck under now if as he goes
to do that I pressure and turn we get

426
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
to do that I pressure and turn we get
 

427
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,309
to do that I pressure and turn we get
kiten right so the kiten nag happens

428
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:33,319
kiten right so the kiten nag happens
 

429
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,670
kiten right so the kiten nag happens
because he came around my suppression

430
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
because he came around my suppression
 

431
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,510
because he came around my suppression
here I hit his face and now he's trying

432
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
here I hit his face and now he's trying
 

433
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,510
here I hit his face and now he's trying
to come around my uh my face suppression

434
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
to come around my uh my face suppression
 

435
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,070
to come around my uh my face suppression
right so my my hand in the face he's

436
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
right so my my hand in the face he's
 

437
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,510
right so my my hand in the face he's
trying to come around that and that

438
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
trying to come around that and that
 

439
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,430
trying to come around that and that
gives us kitan so two techniques that

440
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
gives us kitan so two techniques that
 

441
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,230
gives us kitan so two techniques that
might beat to people like well how would

442
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,240
might beat to people like well how would
 

443
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,350
might beat to people like well how would
juji nag ever appear well how would

444
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
juji nag ever appear well how would
 

445
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,950
juji nag ever appear well how would
kitan nag ever appear they appear really

446
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:53,960
kitan nag ever appear they appear really
 

447
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,149
kitan nag ever appear they appear really
really naturally so understanding the

448
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:56,159
really naturally so understanding the
 

449
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,550
really naturally so understanding the
full series of the shanci series is

450
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
full series of the shanci series is
 

451
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,950
full series of the shanci series is
really important because it gives us

452
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
really important because it gives us
 

453
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,629
really important because it gives us
explanations for every problem that will

454
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:03,639
explanations for every problem that will
 

455
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,629
explanations for every problem that will
arise from the show manucci position

456
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:05,639
arise from the show manucci position
 

457
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,469
arise from the show manucci position
whether I'm choosing to go Eed or

458
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:07,479
whether I'm choosing to go Eed or
 

459
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,430
whether I'm choosing to go Eed or
whether I'm choosing to go Su the Moi

460
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
whether I'm choosing to go Su the Moi
 

461
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,029
whether I'm choosing to go Su the Moi
either way I'll get that so I'm going to

462
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
either way I'll get that so I'm going to
 

463
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,309
either way I'll get that so I'm going to
make another video because there's more

464
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
make another video because there's more
 

465
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,710
make another video because there's more
a lot more actually talk I might end up

466
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
a lot more actually talk I might end up
 

467
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,629
a lot more actually talk I might end up
making three videos to talk about with

468
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:15,639
