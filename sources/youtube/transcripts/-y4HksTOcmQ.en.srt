spectrum of the takedown looks like so
 

23
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,070
spectrum of the takedown looks like so
from getting the position from getting

24
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
from getting the position from getting
 

25
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,910
from getting the position from getting
to the position for the takedown and

26
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
to the position for the takedown and
 

27
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,830
to the position for the takedown and
then how the position works out and then

28
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:29,840
then how the position works out and then
 

29
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,910
then how the position works out and then
if the position gets turned over how

30
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
if the position gets turned over how
 

31
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,310
if the position gets turned over how
that works out as well right so so

32
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
that works out as well right so so
 

33
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,590
that works out as well right so so
looking at all those different

34
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
looking at all those different
 

35
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,350
looking at all those different
possibilities in that

36
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
possibilities in that
 

37
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,510
possibilities in that
so today i actually want to talk about

38
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
so today i actually want to talk about
 

39
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,630
so today i actually want to talk about
percentage of takedown ability right so

40
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
percentage of takedown ability right so
 

41
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,270
percentage of takedown ability right so
how high percentage is a takedown versus

42
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
how high percentage is a takedown versus
 

43
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,950
how high percentage is a takedown versus
the kinds of contexts we're talking

on here and and when we start to talk
about takedowns a very valid question to

76
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
about takedowns a very valid question to
 

77
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,270
about takedowns a very valid question to
ask is how high percentage is that is

78
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
ask is how high percentage is that is
 

79
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,710
ask is how high percentage is that is
that a high percentage technique and

80
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
that a high percentage technique and
 

81
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,469
that a high percentage technique and
this is something that's been

82
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
this is something that's been
 

83
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,149
this is something that's been
really commonly used for a while now in

84
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
really commonly used for a while now in
 

85
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,510
really commonly used for a while now in
martial arts where

86
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
martial arts where
 

87
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,510
martial arts where
i i'm asking how likely is it that i'm

88
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
i i'm asking how likely is it that i'm
 

89
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,270
i i'm asking how likely is it that i'm
going to pull that off so so sure you

90
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
going to pull that off so so sure you
 

91
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,350
going to pull that off so so sure you
can construct any kind of crazy takedown

92
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
can construct any kind of crazy takedown
 

93
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,710
can construct any kind of crazy takedown
you want and it might even work once in

94
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
you want and it might even work once in
 

95
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,710
you want and it might even work once in
a thousand times tried but that would be

96
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
a thousand times tried but that would be
 

97
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,550
a thousand times tried but that would be
what we consider a low percentage

98
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
what we consider a low percentage
 

99
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,310
what we consider a low percentage
technique then there are techniques that

100
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
technique then there are techniques that
 

101
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,910
technique then there are techniques that
we will see often we'll see those

102
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
we will see often we'll see those
 

103
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,830
we will see often we'll see those
techniques all the time and so if you go

104
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
techniques all the time and so if you go
 

105
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,749
techniques all the time and so if you go
look at a judo competition or a

106
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
look at a judo competition or a
 

107
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,830
look at a judo competition or a
greco-roman competition or brazilian

108
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
greco-roman competition or brazilian
 

109
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,670
greco-roman competition or brazilian
jiu-jitsu competition there are throws

110
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
jiu-jitsu competition there are throws
 

111
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,190
jiu-jitsu competition there are throws
that you will see over and over and over

112
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
that you will see over and over and over
 

113
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,350
that you will see over and over and over
that day and those are what we call high

114
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
that day and those are what we call high
 

115
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,870
that day and those are what we call high
percentage take down so those are

116
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
percentage take down so those are
 

117
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,270
percentage take down so those are
takedowns that are done uh often because

118
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
takedowns that are done uh often because
 

119
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,270
takedowns that are done uh often because
they're they're really good okay

120
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
they're they're really good okay
 

121
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,709
they're they're really good okay
now we're going to talk about

122
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
now we're going to talk about
 

123
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,270
now we're going to talk about
when we look at the ikio takedown a lot

124
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
when we look at the ikio takedown a lot
 

125
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,749
when we look at the ikio takedown a lot
of times so so we've seen a lot of

126
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
of times so so we've seen a lot of
 

127
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,190
of times so so we've seen a lot of
questions coming up on this channel

128
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
questions coming up on this channel
 

129
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,229
questions coming up on this channel
recently of um well how likely is it

130
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
recently of um well how likely is it
 

131
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,390
recently of um well how likely is it
that you would even get an echo take

132
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
that you would even get an echo take
 

133
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,229
that you would even get an echo take
down and i think that's a very valid

134
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
down and i think that's a very valid
 

135
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,030
down and i think that's a very valid
question and i kind of want to present a

136
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
question and i kind of want to present a
 

137
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,630
question and i kind of want to present a
way to look at it for you to kind of

138
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
way to look at it for you to kind of
 

139
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,910
way to look at it for you to kind of
start to think about it i'm not going to

140
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
start to think about it i'm not going to
 

141
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,030
start to think about it i'm not going to
try to justify

142
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
try to justify
 

143
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,030
try to justify
that aikido is a high percentage

144
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
that aikido is a high percentage
 

145
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,790
that aikido is a high percentage
takedown because i personally don't

146
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
takedown because i personally don't
 

147
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,390
takedown because i personally don't
think it's a high percentage takedown

148
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
think it's a high percentage takedown
 

149
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,830
think it's a high percentage takedown
but i'm going to show you why it

150
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
but i'm going to show you why it
 

151
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,430
but i'm going to show you why it
probably exists and why we need to think

152
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
probably exists and why we need to think
 

153
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,750
probably exists and why we need to think
about it okay so first we need to go we

154
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
about it okay so first we need to go we
 

155
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,990
about it okay so first we need to go we
need to ask what are high percentage

156
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
need to ask what are high percentage
 

157
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,070
need to ask what are high percentage
takedowns okay so i think we could

158
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
takedowns okay so i think we could
 

159
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,750
takedowns okay so i think we could
definitely make the argument that a

160
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
definitely make the argument that a
 

161
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,229
definitely make the argument that a
double leg takedown is a high percentage

162
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239

techniques are going to be a high
 

225
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,470
techniques are going to be a high
percentage technique and we're going to

226
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
percentage technique and we're going to
 

227
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,750
percentage technique and we're going to
see that we can see it from the front or

228
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
see that we can see it from the front or
 

229
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,110
see that we can see it from the front or
the back or the side we're going to see

230
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
the back or the side we're going to see
 

231
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
the back or the side we're going to see
these a lot so if we went to a wrestling

232
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
these a lot so if we went to a wrestling
 

233
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,630
these a lot so if we went to a wrestling
tournament or a brazilian jitsu terms

234
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
tournament or a brazilian jitsu terms
 

235
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,830
tournament or a brazilian jitsu terms
your term you can see there's a lot

236
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
your term you can see there's a lot
 

237
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,990
your term you can see there's a lot
those are super high percentage how

238
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
those are super high percentage how
 

239
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
those are super high percentage how
likely is it that i'm going to take a

240
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
likely is it that i'm going to take a
 

241
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,550
likely is it that i'm going to take a
guy down with this okay now in a context

242
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
guy down with this okay now in a context
 

243
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,949
guy down with this okay now in a context
where this guy is is trying to stop me

244
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
where this guy is is trying to stop me
 

245
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,309
where this guy is is trying to stop me
from taking him down and i've got him

246
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
from taking him down and i've got him
 

247
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,550
from taking him down and i've got him
and i want to take him down probably not

248
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
and i want to take him down probably not
 

249
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,550
and i want to take him down probably not
very high percentage why is that not

250
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
very high percentage why is that not
 

251
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,350
very high percentage why is that not
high percentage well one because i only

252
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
high percentage well one because i only
 

253
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,670
high percentage well one because i only
have control of his arm so if we look at

254
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
have control of his arm so if we look at
 

255
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,830
have control of his arm so if we look at
why the double leg takedown's good it's

256
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
why the double leg takedown's good it's
 

257
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,189
why the double leg takedown's good it's
good because i'm controlling both of his

258
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
good because i'm controlling both of his
 

259
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,629
good because i'm controlling both of his
legs which is what he's going to balance

260
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
legs which is what he's going to balance
 

261
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,469
legs which is what he's going to balance
himself with or even one of his legs and

262
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
himself with or even one of his legs and
 

263
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,670
himself with or even one of his legs and
he's going to balance himself with those

264
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
he's going to balance himself with those
 

265
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,870
he's going to balance himself with those
so if he doesn't have those he can

266
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
so if he doesn't have those he can
 

267
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,110
so if he doesn't have those he can
balance himself let's look at the high

268
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
balance himself let's look at the high
 

269
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,670
balance himself let's look at the high
percentage body control takedown right

270
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
percentage body control takedown right
 

271
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,550
percentage body control takedown right
well i'm able to pick up his entire body

272
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
well i'm able to pick up his entire body
 

273
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,629
well i'm able to pick up his entire body
with this and by doing that he won't

274
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
with this and by doing that he won't
 

275
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,230
with this and by doing that he won't
have legs to support him so that's a

276
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
have legs to support him so that's a
 

277
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,390
have legs to support him so that's a
high percentage throw or take down as

278
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
high percentage throw or take down as
 

279
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,550
high percentage throw or take down as
well but when i'm looking at this i'm

280
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
well but when i'm looking at this i'm
 

281
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,150
well but when i'm looking at this i'm
not really controlling his legs now sure

282
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
not really controlling his legs now sure
 

283
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,430
not really controlling his legs now sure
i could trip or something but that would

284
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
i could trip or something but that would
 

285
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,710
i could trip or something but that would
be a different technique than just

286
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
be a different technique than just
 

287
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,710
be a different technique than just
taking him down with his arms um and and

288
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
taking him down with his arms um and and
 

289
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,390
taking him down with his arms um and and
we could say that's a variation we come

290
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
we could say that's a variation we come
 

291
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,749
we could say that's a variation we come
around to that but but this is not going

292
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
around to that but but this is not going
 

293
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,270
around to that but but this is not going
to be very high percentage and so this

294
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
to be very high percentage and so this
 

295
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,950
to be very high percentage and so this
is why you don't see it in judo or

296
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
is why you don't see it in judo or
 

297
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,550
is why you don't see it in judo or
brazilian determinants it's not high

298
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
brazilian determinants it's not high
 

299
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,590
brazilian determinants it's not high
percentage okay so in that context why

300
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
percentage okay so in that context why
 

301
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,990
percentage okay so in that context why
don't you see eco takedowns in in

302
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
don't you see eco takedowns in in
 

303
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,909
don't you see eco takedowns in in
regular grappling situations like

304
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
regular grappling situations like
 

305
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,749
regular grappling situations like
tournaments or even go to a gym where

306
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
tournaments or even go to a gym where
 

307
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,870
tournaments or even go to a gym where
they're sparring wrigley you won't see

308
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
they're sparring wrigley you won't see
 

309
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,710
they're sparring wrigley you won't see
them because it's not high percentage

310
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
them because it's not high percentage
 

311
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,469
them because it's not high percentage
now let's see why it might exist in

312
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
now let's see why it might exist in
 

313
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,590
now let's see why it might exist in
aikido now if this guy has a knife in

314
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
aikido now if this guy has a knife in
 

315
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,830
aikido now if this guy has a knife in
his hand or any kind of weapon a club or

316
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
his hand or any kind of weapon a club or
 

317
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,590
his hand or any kind of weapon a club or
whatever you want to say a gun whatever

318
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
whatever you want to say a gun whatever
 

319
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,990
whatever you want to say a gun whatever
it is right okay now if i do a double

320
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,909
i've come down here i'm completely
exposed to that knife right so i can't

326
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
exposed to that knife right so i can't
 

327
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,749
exposed to that knife right so i can't
stop that knife from coming in right now

stop that knife from coming in right now
 

329
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,510
stop that knife from coming in right now
of course i could come up here maybe i

330
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
of course i could come up here maybe i
 

331
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,590
of course i could come up here maybe i
could get a single leg off of this but

332
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
could get a single leg off of this but
 

333
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,390
could get a single leg off of this but
still in order to get to that position i

334
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
still in order to get to that position i
 

335
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,710
still in order to get to that position i
endanger myself by shooting everything

336
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
endanger myself by shooting everything
 

337
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,070
endanger myself by shooting everything
down in here and

338
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
down in here and
 

339
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,749
down in here and
taking a good chance of getting cut

340
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
taking a good chance of getting cut
 

341
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,590
taking a good chance of getting cut
further even once i get the takedown

342
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
further even once i get the takedown
 

343
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,909
further even once i get the takedown
unless i've somehow secured that hand

344
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
unless i've somehow secured that hand
 

345
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,749
unless i've somehow secured that hand
i'm not going to be able to take him

346
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
i'm not going to be able to take him
 

347
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,830
i'm not going to be able to take him
down now you can say of course well then

348
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
down now you can say of course well then
 

349
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,430
down now you can say of course well then
you would just shoot a double leg and

350
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
you would just shoot a double leg and
 

351
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,909
you would just shoot a double leg and
grab the wrist it's really hard to grab

352
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
grab the wrist it's really hard to grab
 

353
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,590
grab the wrist it's really hard to grab
the wrist out of the air so if you've

354
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
the wrist out of the air so if you've
 

355
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,950
the wrist out of the air so if you've
never tried that you should try grabbing

356
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
never tried that you should try grabbing
 

357
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,230
never tried that you should try grabbing
the wrist out of the air meaning that

358
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
the wrist out of the air meaning that
 

359
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,670
the wrist out of the air meaning that
while i'm dedicated down here and i see

360
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
while i'm dedicated down here and i see
 

361
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,189
while i'm dedicated down here and i see
that knife and i go like this it's going

362
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
that knife and i go like this it's going
 

363
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,350
that knife and i go like this it's going
to be real hard for me to get that hand

364
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
to be real hard for me to get that hand
 

365
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,550
to be real hard for me to get that hand
right so it's going to be hard for me to

366
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
right so it's going to be hard for me to
 

367
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,110
right so it's going to be hard for me to
get it not impossible but this maybe

368
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
get it not impossible but this maybe
 

369
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,350
get it not impossible but this maybe
isn't the best way to go at trying to

370
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
isn't the best way to go at trying to
 

371
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,029
isn't the best way to go at trying to
take someone down who's got something in

372
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
take someone down who's got something in
 

373
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,590
take someone down who's got something in
their hand or could potentially have

374
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
their hand or could potentially have
 

375
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,909
their hand or could potentially have
something in their hand okay now what

376
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
something in their hand okay now what
 

377
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,710
something in their hand okay now what
about an upper body hold now if i got

378
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
about an upper body hold now if i got
 

379
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,790
about an upper body hold now if i got
the upper body hold in like say i got a

380
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
the upper body hold in like say i got a
 

381
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,629
the upper body hold in like say i got a
waist lock right of course we can see

382
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
waist lock right of course we can see
 

383
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,309
waist lock right of course we can see
this is not a great idea because he's

384
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
this is not a great idea because he's
 

385
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,430
this is not a great idea because he's
easily able here to stab i could though

386
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
easily able here to stab i could though
 

387
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,070
easily able here to stab i could though
cinch over the top or grab the hand to

388
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
cinch over the top or grab the hand to
 

389
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,150
cinch over the top or grab the hand to
get that upper body hold now we might

390
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
get that upper body hold now we might
 

391
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,629
get that upper body hold now we might
see a throw similar to this in judo

392
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
see a throw similar to this in judo
 

393
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,390
see a throw similar to this in judo
because judo comes from old style jiu

394
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
because judo comes from old style jiu
 

395
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,390
because judo comes from old style jiu
jitsu which is the same

396
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
jitsu which is the same
 

397
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,390
jitsu which is the same
lineage as aikido comes from this old

398
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
lineage as aikido comes from this old
 

399
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,830
lineage as aikido comes from this old
school and you'll see this arm

400
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
school and you'll see this arm
 

401
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,510
school and you'll see this arm
controlling now

402
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
controlling now
 

403
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,749
controlling now
the problem with this is even when i

404
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
the problem with this is even when i
 

405
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,230
the problem with this is even when i
come in here like this he still has a

406
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
come in here like this he still has a
 

407
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,909
come in here like this he still has a
good chance of getting that knife hand

408
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
good chance of getting that knife hand
 

409
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,150
good chance of getting that knife hand
free right if he pulls this directly

410
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
free right if he pulls this directly
 

411
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,749
free right if he pulls this directly
away from me now i've got to come in

412
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
away from me now i've got to come in
 

413
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,589
away from me now i've got to come in
here and get it now if when he pulls the

414
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
here and get it now if when he pulls the
 

415
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,270
here and get it now if when he pulls the
hand away he puts this hand against my

416
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
hand away he puts this hand against my
 

417
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,189
hand away he puts this hand against my
chest now i'm in a really horrible

418
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
chest now i'm in a really horrible
 

419
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,309
chest now i'm in a really horrible
position so this kind of movement which

420
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
position so this kind of movement which
 

421
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,309
position so this kind of movement which
could work to keep him from stabbing can

422
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
could work to keep him from stabbing can
 

423
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,629
could work to keep him from stabbing can
be kind of dangerous right so because

424
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
be kind of dangerous right so because
 

425
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,670
be kind of dangerous right so because
there's a lot of bad things that can

426
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
there's a lot of bad things that can
 

427
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,510
there's a lot of bad things that can
happen there now of course if we look at

428
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
happen there now of course if we look at
 

429
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,430
happen there now of course if we look at
the percentages that won't always happen

430
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
the percentages that won't always happen
 

431
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,029
the percentages that won't always happen
sometimes i will throw them down i have

432
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
sometimes i will throw them down i have
 

433
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,390
sometimes i will throw them down i have
taken people down with a knife in their

434
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
taken people down with a knife in their
 

435
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,870
taken people down with a knife in their
hand this way before so totally a doable

436
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
hand this way before so totally a doable
 

437
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,270
hand this way before so totally a doable
thing you can totally do it but it's

438
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
thing you can totally do it but it's
 

439
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,870
thing you can totally do it but it's
probably going to be kind of dangerous

440
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
probably going to be kind of dangerous
 

441
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,469
probably going to be kind of dangerous
so would i throw them yes would i

442
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
so would i throw them yes would i
 

443
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,950
so would i throw them yes would i
probably get stabbed for it probably yes

444
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
probably get stabbed for it probably yes
 

445
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,070
probably get stabbed for it probably yes
right so both of our common unarmed

446
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
right so both of our common unarmed
 

447
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,390
right so both of our common unarmed
takedown techniques are not going to be

448
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
takedown techniques are not going to be
 

449
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,950
takedown techniques are not going to be
all that great in an armed situation

450
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
all that great in an armed situation
 

451
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,110
all that great in an armed situation
okay now let's look at if we were doing

452
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
okay now let's look at if we were doing
 

453
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,950
okay now let's look at if we were doing
this technique and we'll talk about why

454
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
this technique and we'll talk about why
 

455
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,390
this technique and we'll talk about why
it's bad and we'll talk about why it's

456
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
it's bad and we'll talk about why it's
 

457
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,309
it's bad and we'll talk about why it's
good now if we're in this kind of

458
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
good now if we're in this kind of
 

459
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,790
good now if we're in this kind of
position you can see my whole body's

460
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
position you can see my whole body's
 

461
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,350
position you can see my whole body's
away from him now let's say he switched

462
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
away from him now let's say he switched
 

463
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,430
away from him now let's say he switched
hands because that's an option he has

464
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
hands because that's an option he has
 

465
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,670
hands because that's an option he has
now notice i still have the entirety of

466
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
now notice i still have the entirety of
 

467
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,430
now notice i still have the entirety of
his body holding him away from me so if

468
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
his body holding him away from me so if
 

469
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,350
his body holding him away from me so if
he reaches in there for stabbing you can

470
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
he reaches in there for stabbing you can
 

471
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,189
he reaches in there for stabbing you can
see it's really difficult for him to get

472
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
see it's really difficult for him to get
 

473
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,510
see it's really difficult for him to get
that and in fact the more he reaches so

474
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
that and in fact the more he reaches so
 

475
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,469
that and in fact the more he reaches so
i'll just let him reach in right now

476
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
i'll just let him reach in right now
 

477
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,749
i'll just let him reach in right now
okay so he's just re

478
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759

him from the other side is actually what
makes that possible now it's dangerous

502
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
makes that possible now it's dangerous

ability to deal with him and this also
 

525
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,070
ability to deal with him and this also
extends into not taking him down but

526
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
extends into not taking him down but
 

527
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,990

type of takedown for this situation so

562
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
type of takedown for this situation so
 

563
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,509
type of takedown for this situation so
it is a lower percentage takedown

564
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
it is a lower percentage takedown
 

565
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,070
it is a lower percentage takedown
overall if we are looking at getting the

566
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
overall if we are looking at getting the
 

567
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,990
overall if we are looking at getting the
takedown then it's going to be lower

568
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
takedown then it's going to be lower
 

569
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,190
takedown then it's going to be lower
percentage but for the the situation of

570
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
percentage but for the the situation of
 

571
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,990
percentage but for the the situation of
a knife it's the only kind of situation

572
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
a knife it's the only kind of situation

where you're going to get them down now

574
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
where you're going to get them down now
 

575
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,630
where you're going to get them down now
udeo say which just means an arm

576
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
udeo say which just means an arm
 

577
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,949
udeo say which just means an arm
takedown is one of a variation of things

578
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
takedown is one of a variation of things
 

579
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,509
takedown is one of a variation of things
this could also become a rokyo so if

580
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
this could also become a rokyo so if
 

581
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,190
this could also become a rokyo so if
taking them down is the number one

582
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
taking them down is the number one
 

583
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,269
taking them down is the number one
objective then a rocchio will become

584
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
objective then a rocchio will become
 

585
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,990
objective then a rocchio will become
higher percentage than an ekyo i could

586
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
higher percentage than an ekyo i could
 

587
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,230
higher percentage than an ekyo i could
also do something like variations of

588
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
also do something like variations of
 

589
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,750
also do something like variations of
russian two on ones or all kinds of

590
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
russian two on ones or all kinds of
 

591
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,110
russian two on ones or all kinds of
things that you will find in other

592
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
things that you will find in other
 

593
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,430
things that you will find in other
unarmed martial arts so so those kinds

594
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
unarmed martial arts so so those kinds
 

595
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,670
unarmed martial arts so so those kinds
of things will appear but the reason you

596
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
of things will appear but the reason you
 

597
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,829
of things will appear but the reason you
won't see the regular high percentage

598
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
won't see the regular high percentage
 

599
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,430
won't see the regular high percentage
takedowns in aikido is because we're

600
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
takedowns in aikido is because we're
 

601
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,509
takedowns in aikido is because we're
always accounting for a weapon and so

602
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
always accounting for a weapon and so
 

603
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,949
always accounting for a weapon and so
that means we're going to relegate

604
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
that means we're going to relegate
 

605
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,030
that means we're going to relegate
ourselves to a slightly lower percentage

606
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
ourselves to a slightly lower percentage
 

607
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,790
ourselves to a slightly lower percentage
set of techniques that allows us to take

608
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
set of techniques that allows us to take
 

609
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,030
set of techniques that allows us to take
care of ourselves now when we start to

610
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
care of ourselves now when we start to
 

611
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,030
care of ourselves now when we start to
transition this from

612
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
transition this from
 

613
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,790
transition this from
uh japanese jiu jitsu which is

techniques the takedowns we have in

660
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
techniques the takedowns we have in
 

661
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,990
techniques the takedowns we have in
aikido are not super high percentage

662
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
aikido are not super high percentage
 

663

aikido are not super high percentage
takedowns but the high percentage

664
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
takedowns but the high percentage
 

665
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,590
takedowns but the high percentage
takedowns that you would use would be

666
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
takedowns that you would use would be
 

667
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,150
takedowns that you would use would be
deadly if their hands were both free now

668
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
deadly if their hands were both free now
 

669
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,550
deadly if their hands were both free now
there's a slightly lower percentage set

670
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
there's a slightly lower percentage set
 

671
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,389
there's a slightly lower percentage set
of takedowns that you can use that

672
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
of takedowns that you can use that
 

673
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,870
of takedowns that you can use that
control the hand and it does a good job

674
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
control the hand and it does a good job
 

675
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,470
control the hand and it does a good job
of that right so and those could be

676
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
of that right so and those could be
 

677
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
of that right so and those could be
something you know from a russian two on

678
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
something you know from a russian two on
 

679
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,350
something you know from a russian two on
one or something like that from

680
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
one or something like that from
 

681
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,870
one or something like that from
wrestling which which could be a good

682
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
wrestling which which could be a good
 

683
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,790
wrestling which which could be a good
high percentage technique there are some

684
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
high percentage technique there are some
 

685
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,389
high percentage technique there are some
problems with that too but but could be

686
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
problems with that too but but could be
 

687
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,949
problems with that too but but could be
a better higher percentage technique um

688
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
a better higher percentage technique um
 

689
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,670
a better higher percentage technique um
but

690
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
but
 

691
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,670
but
that's only when there's a weapon being

692
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
that's only when there's a weapon being
 

693
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,509
that's only when there's a weapon being
accounted for right so that's what we're

694
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
accounted for right so that's what we're
 

695
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,389
accounted for right so that's what we're
doing with the weapon is we're

696
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
doing with the weapon is we're
 

697
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,069
doing with the weapon is we're
accounting for the weapon in that way um

698
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
accounting for the weapon in that way um
 

699
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,509
accounting for the weapon in that way um
and then when we're actually looking at

700
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
and then when we're actually looking at
 

701
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,829
and then when we're actually looking at
aikido we're only ever looking at aikido

702
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
aikido we're only ever looking at aikido
 

703
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,990
aikido we're only ever looking at aikido
takedowns when either a i'm way bigger

704
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
takedowns when either a i'm way bigger
 

705
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,910
takedowns when either a i'm way bigger
than them and i could do any takedown i

706
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
than them and i could do any takedown i
 

707
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,269
than them and i could do any takedown i
want because i'm just significantly

708
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
want because i'm just significantly
 

709
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,110
want because i'm just significantly
larger than there but the takedowns i

710
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
larger than there but the takedowns i
 

711
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,910
larger than there but the takedowns i
choose in aikido like this eco takedown

712
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
choose in aikido like this eco takedown
 

713
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,550
choose in aikido like this eco takedown
is a good takedown to protect me and him

714
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
is a good takedown to protect me and him
 

715
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,310
is a good takedown to protect me and him
and anyone around us when i take him

716
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
and anyone around us when i take him
 

717
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,230
and anyone around us when i take him
down so it's a better take down for that

718
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
down so it's a better take down for that
 

719
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,710
down so it's a better take down for that
kind of situation or a situation where

720
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
kind of situation or a situation where
 

721
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,870
kind of situation or a situation where
he just happened to be so off balance

722
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
he just happened to be so off balance
 

723
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,389
he just happened to be so off balance
that i could take him down with that and

724
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
that i could take him down with that and
 

725
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,750
that i could take him down with that and
that was safe for me otherwise we're

726
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
that was safe for me otherwise we're
 

727
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,110
that was safe for me otherwise we're
always trying to get out of there and

728
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
always trying to get out of there and
 

729
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,269
always trying to get out of there and
make distance so these are just some

730
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
make distance so these are just some
 

731
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,389
make distance so these are just some
things to think about when you're

732
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
things to think about when you're
 

733
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,230
things to think about when you're
looking at aikido and takedowns i hope

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
looking at aikido and takedowns i hope
