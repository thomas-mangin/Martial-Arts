00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,880

hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:01,890
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,690
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about the difference

4
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:02,700
going to talk about the difference
 

5
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,170
going to talk about the difference
between jiu-jitsu and Aikido so Jitsu

6
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,180
between jiu-jitsu and Aikido so Jitsu
 

7
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,910
between jiu-jitsu and Aikido so Jitsu
and Aikido have a very entangled past so

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
and Aikido have a very entangled past so
 

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,680
and Aikido have a very entangled past so
Aikido comes from jiu-jitsu more heyyo a

10
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:12,690
Aikido comes from jiu-jitsu more heyyo a
 

11
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,360
Aikido comes from jiu-jitsu more heyyo a
Shiba studied jiu-jitsu and and the

12
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,370
Shiba studied jiu-jitsu and and the
 

13
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,770
Shiba studied jiu-jitsu and and the
ideas of Aikido came from that but

14
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:15,780
ideas of Aikido came from that but
 

15
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,450
ideas of Aikido came from that but
Aikido became a different martial art

16
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,460
Aikido became a different martial art
 

17
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,609
Aikido became a different martial art
than jiu-jitsu and so today we're gonna

18
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:19,619
than jiu-jitsu and so today we're gonna
 

19
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,679
than jiu-jitsu and so today we're gonna
take Josh and Maia we're gonna have them

20
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:21,689
take Josh and Maia we're gonna have them
 

21
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,870
take Josh and Maia we're gonna have them
do a myriad of different practices live

22
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880
do a myriad of different practices live
 

23
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,790
do a myriad of different practices live
practices so you guys can see what the

24
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
practices so you guys can see what the
 

25
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,439
practices so you guys can see what the
different difference between those two

26
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:27,449
different difference between those two
 

27
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,880
different difference between those two
are so in Aikido you have a goal that is

28
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:31,890
are so in Aikido you have a goal that is
 

29
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,280
are so in Aikido you have a goal that is
simply to not be dominated that's the

30
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,290
simply to not be dominated that's the
 

31
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,959
simply to not be dominated that's the
only goal of Aikido I don't I don't want

32
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:35,969
only goal of Aikido I don't I don't want
 

33
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,310
only goal of Aikido I don't I don't want
to throw anyone else or hurting a while

34
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
to throw anyone else or hurting a while
 

35
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,990
to throw anyone else or hurting a while
so do anything anyone else whereas in

36
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
so do anything anyone else whereas in
 

37
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,610
so do anything anyone else whereas in
shits if you have a very clear goal of I

38
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,620
shits if you have a very clear goal of I
 

39
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,110
shits if you have a very clear goal of I
do want to dominate someone else right

40
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
do want to dominate someone else right
 

41
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,700
do want to dominate someone else right
so I'm in contention with someone else

42
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:43,710
so I'm in contention with someone else
 

43
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,600
so I'm in contention with someone else
and the way I'm gonna stop that

44
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:44,610
and the way I'm gonna stop that
 

45
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,190
and the way I'm gonna stop that
contingent is to physically dominate

46
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,200
contingent is to physically dominate
 

47
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,500
contingent is to physically dominate
them both have their place so one's not

48
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,510
them both have their place so one's not
 

49
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,850
them both have their place so one's not
better than the other but they're two

50
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:49,860
better than the other but they're two
 

51
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,189
better than the other but they're two
totally different kinds of studies if

52
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:52,199
totally different kinds of studies if
 

53
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,770
totally different kinds of studies if
you are not very skilled and not very

54
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:54,780
you are not very skilled and not very
 

55
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,869
you are not very skilled and not very
physical then Aikido would probably be a

56
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
physical then Aikido would probably be a
 

57
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,099
physical then Aikido would probably be a
better way to go because you're not

58
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:58,109
better way to go because you're not
 

59
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,240
better way to go because you're not
going to physically dominate someone

60
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,250
going to physically dominate someone
 

61
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,040
going to physically dominate someone
who's greater than you however if you

62
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
who's greater than you however if you
 

63
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,540
who's greater than you however if you
have a chance then maybe jiu-jitsu is

64
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,550
have a chance then maybe jiu-jitsu is
 

65
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,889
have a chance then maybe jiu-jitsu is
the way to handle it right so there's

66
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:03,899
the way to handle it right so there's
 

67
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,479
the way to handle it right so there's
different ways that you want to approach

68
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:05,489
different ways that you want to approach
 

69
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,910
different ways that you want to approach
situations at different times and so

70
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
situations at different times and so
 

71
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
situations at different times and so
there's different martial arts for that

72
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,210
there's different martial arts for that
 

73
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,000
there's different martial arts for that
so a lot of times I think when jiu-jitsu

74
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,010
so a lot of times I think when jiu-jitsu
 

75
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,460
so a lot of times I think when jiu-jitsu
people look at Aikido they think Aikido

76
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,470
people look at Aikido they think Aikido
 

77
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,380
people look at Aikido they think Aikido
is trying to achieve the same goals as

78
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
is trying to achieve the same goals as
 

79
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,020
is trying to achieve the same goals as
jiu-jitsu does and so it's confusing to

80
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,030
jiu-jitsu does and so it's confusing to
 

81
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,060
jiu-jitsu does and so it's confusing to
look at and I think a lot of times

82
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,070
look at and I think a lot of times
 

83
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,219
look at and I think a lot of times
Aikido practice Aikido people see

84
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,229
Aikido practice Aikido people see
 

85
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,570
Aikido practice Aikido people see
jiu-jitsu and they kind of want to do

86
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:23,580
jiu-jitsu and they kind of want to do
 

87
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,490
jiu-jitsu and they kind of want to do
jiu-jitsu and so then that gets all

88
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,500
jiu-jitsu and so then that gets all
 

89
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,649
jiu-jitsu and so then that gets all
mixed up so we need to have a clear way

90
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:27,659
mixed up so we need to have a clear way
 

91
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,940
mixed up so we need to have a clear way
to look at the difference and so at

92
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:28,950
to look at the difference and so at
 

93
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,770
to look at the difference and so at
least with my approach to Aikido I'm

94
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:30,780
least with my approach to Aikido I'm
 

95
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,730
least with my approach to Aikido I'm
going to show the difference between

96
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:31,740
going to show the difference between
 

97
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,679
going to show the difference between
those two so we're gonna have Josh Amaya

98
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:33,689
those two so we're gonna have Josh Amaya
 

99
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,990
those two so we're gonna have Josh Amaya
do a modern style Jiu Jitsu grappling

100
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
do a modern style Jiu Jitsu grappling
 

101
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,969
do a modern style Jiu Jitsu grappling
that's gonna be on the ground then we're

102
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:37,979
that's gonna be on the ground then we're
 

103
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,530
that's gonna be on the ground then we're
gonna have him do some arm grappling

104
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
gonna have him do some arm grappling
 

105
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,340
gonna have him do some arm grappling
that would be a little more like

106
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,350
that would be a little more like
 

107
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,170
that would be a little more like
traditional Jiu Jitsu and then we're

108
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
traditional Jiu Jitsu and then we're
 

109
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,389
traditional Jiu Jitsu and then we're
gonna have a move into Aikido and you'll

00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:48,149
each one of those is different I'm gonna
 

115

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,670
schools you would go look at right now
there is a high emphasis on head control

136
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:16,680
there is a high emphasis on head control
 

137
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,309
there is a high emphasis on head control
leg control and core control so you can

leg control and core control so you can
 

139
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,780

to pass josh trying to hold her in
 

145
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,699
to pass josh trying to hold her in

146
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:26,709
there's a little bit of wrist control
 

147
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,920
there's a little bit of wrist control
going on there but not too much much

148
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:28,930

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,120
in there and which is exactly what she
wanted to trap the arm and she gets the

170
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,130

she's trying to pass we're gonna go
 

175
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,240
she's trying to pass we're gonna go
ahead and pause it right here okay so

176
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,250
ahead and pause it right here okay so
 

177
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,699
ahead and pause it right here okay so
you see basic stuff you see there in

178
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:04,709
you see basic stuff you see there in
 

179
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,030
you see basic stuff you see there in
classic jujitsu which is because there's

180
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
classic jujitsu which is because there's
 

181
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,590
classic jujitsu which is because there's
no weapon involved you can choose to go

182
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:10,600
no weapon involved you can choose to go
 

183
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,880
no weapon involved you can choose to go
either right or left you're free to go

184
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:11,890
either right or left you're free to go
 

185
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,430
either right or left you're free to go
either right to the right or the left

186
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
either right to the right or the left
 

187
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
either right to the right or the left
wrist control is not of great importance

188
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,570
wrist control is not of great importance
 

189
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,600
wrist control is not of great importance
because the arms aren't actually doing

190
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,610
because the arms aren't actually doing
 

191
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,640
because the arms aren't actually doing
all that much they can generally be

192
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,650
all that much they can generally be
 

193
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,890
all that much they can generally be
taken care of by pushing an elbow off or

194
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:22,900
taken care of by pushing an elbow off or
 

195
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,870
taken care of by pushing an elbow off or
or ducking around the arm so most of

196
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:24,880
or ducking around the arm so most of
 

197
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,979
or ducking around the arm so most of
what the arms are doing can be nullified

198
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:25,989
what the arms are doing can be nullified
 

199
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,170
what the arms are doing can be nullified
much more easy than wrist control so

200
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,180
much more easy than wrist control so
 

201
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,060
much more easy than wrist control so
most of the emphasis is going towards

202
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,070
most of the emphasis is going towards
 

203
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,250
most of the emphasis is going towards
legs clearing the legs trying to pass

204
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,260
legs clearing the legs trying to pass
 

205
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,460
legs clearing the legs trying to pass
those legs and core control and head

206
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:35,470
those legs and core control and head
 

207
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,960
those legs and core control and head
control so there was tons of that in

208
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:36,970
control so there was tons of that in
 

209
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,770
control so there was tons of that in
there and that's what you would see in

210
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:37,780
there and that's what you would see in
 

211
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,530
there and that's what you would see in
modern jujitsu is lots of those things

212
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:39,540
modern jujitsu is lots of those things
 

213
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,640
modern jujitsu is lots of those things
because there's no weapon to be involved

214
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:41,650
because there's no weapon to be involved
 

215
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,190
because there's no weapon to be involved
right so the arms are really not of that

216
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,200
right so the arms are really not of that
 

217
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,720
right so the arms are really not of that
great importance okay so now we're gonna

218
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:45,730
great importance okay so now we're gonna
 

219
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,360
great importance okay so now we're gonna
see a hybridizing between the two which

220
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,370
see a hybridizing between the two which
 

221
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,890
see a hybridizing between the two which
is you're gonna see a ground only game

222
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:49,900
is you're gonna see a ground only game
 

223
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,930
is you're gonna see a ground only game
which is more what modern jujitsu goes

224
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:51,940
which is more what modern jujitsu goes
 

225
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,759
which is more what modern jujitsu goes
towards now is is ground grappling

226
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:53,769
towards now is is ground grappling
 

227
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,110
towards now is is ground grappling
ground grappling is much more important

228
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
ground grappling is much more important
 

229
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
ground grappling is much more important
and modern jujitsu than it was in

230
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,410
and modern jujitsu than it was in
 

231
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,349
and modern jujitsu than it was in
traditional jujitsu so we're gonna see

232
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:58,359
traditional jujitsu so we're gonna see
 

233
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,060
traditional jujitsu so we're gonna see
that but at the same time we're gonna

234
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,070
that but at the same time we're gonna
 

235
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,770
that but at the same time we're gonna
introduce a weapon and so Maya has a

236
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:01,780
introduce a weapon and so Maya has a
 

237
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,009
introduce a weapon and so Maya has a
weapon tucked into her pants in the

238
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:05,019
weapon tucked into her pants in the
 

239
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,000
weapon tucked into her pants in the
front there

240
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,010
front there
 

241
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,770
front there
and she's been instructed to only draw

242
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:07,780
and she's been instructed to only draw
 

243
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,600
and she's been instructed to only draw
the knife when they go into the clinch

244
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,610
the knife when they go into the clinch
 

245
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,949
the knife when they go into the clinch
and also the second they go into the

246
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
and also the second they go into the
 

247
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,179
and also the second they go into the
clinch Josh could draw the knife as well

248
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:12,189
clinch Josh could draw the knife as well
 

249
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,429
clinch Josh could draw the knife as well

00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:14,439
so so they're going to be grappling on
 

251
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,420

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,150
back here in a second so he's trying to
 

487
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,300
back here in a second so he's trying to
fall to a rear-naked but notice he had

488
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,310
fall to a rear-naked but notice he had
 

489
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,680

494
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,410
just go into that rear-naked like you
 

495
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,550
just go into that rear-naked like you
would in modern jujitsu because he had

496
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,560
would in modern jujitsu because he had
 

497
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,200
would in modern jujitsu because he had
to keep the knife in check right so

498
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,210
to keep the knife in check right so
 

499
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,180
to keep the knife in check right so
that's a that's an important difference

500
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,190
that's a that's an important difference
 

501
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,070
that's a that's an important difference
between learning to grapple armed and

502
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,080
between learning to grapple armed and
 

503
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,470
between learning to grapple armed and
learned grandpa unarmed if you learn to

504
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:25,480
learned grandpa unarmed if you learn to
 

505
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,960
learned grandpa unarmed if you learn to
grapple unarmed it's really confusing a

506
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,970
grapple unarmed it's really confusing a
 

507
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,190
grapple unarmed it's really confusing a
lot of times when there's a weapon in

508
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,200
lot of times when there's a weapon in
 

509
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,930
lot of times when there's a weapon in
play because what you're trained to do

510
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:30,940
play because what you're trained to do
 

511
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,220
play because what you're trained to do
how you're trained to move

512
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,230
how you're trained to move
 

513
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,840
how you're trained to move
won't account for the weapon because

514
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:33,850
won't account for the weapon because
 

515
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,250
won't account for the weapon because
you're not used to dealing with a weapon

516
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:35,260
you're not used to dealing with a weapon
 

517
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,500
you're not used to dealing with a weapon
and so there's a lot of sacrifices you

518
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,510
and so there's a lot of sacrifices you
 

519
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,670
and so there's a lot of sacrifices you
have to make when you start grappling

520
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,680
have to make when you start grappling
 

521
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,860
have to make when you start grappling
with a weapon so you know the beginning

522
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:40,870
with a weapon so you know the beginning
 

523
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,180
with a weapon so you know the beginning
of that standard started out exactly

524
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,190
of that standard started out exactly
 

525
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,500
of that standard started out exactly
like traditional Jitsu and went to the

526
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,510
like traditional Jitsu and went to the
 

527
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,370
like traditional Jitsu and went to the
ground and it's not the traditional

528
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:44,380
ground and it's not the traditional
 

529
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,260
ground and it's not the traditional
Jitsu didn't have ground emphasis but

530
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,270
Jitsu didn't have ground emphasis but
 

531
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,180
Jitsu didn't have ground emphasis but
the main emphasis was was standing stuff

532
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,190
the main emphasis was was standing stuff
 

533
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,080
the main emphasis was was standing stuff
okay so now we're gonna see Aikido

534
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,090
okay so now we're gonna see Aikido
 

535
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,420
okay so now we're gonna see Aikido
scenario so Maya again has the knife

536
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,430
scenario so Maya again has the knife
 

537
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,690

fashion so now she's going to try to use
 

541
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,830
fashion so now she's going to try to use
Aikido to thwart Josh's attempt to use

jiu-jitsu so josh is still using
jiu-jitsu essentially right so it's

546
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:05,650
jiu-jitsu essentially right so it's
 

547
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,230
jiu-jitsu essentially right so it's
gonna be it's gonna look much more like

548

for that being that and you know that
 

553
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,740
for that being that and you know that
that's a small distinction sometimes but

554
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:13,750
that's a small distinction sometimes but
 

555
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,270
that's a small distinction sometimes but
the reason for that being he's going to

556
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,280
the reason for that being he's going to
 

557
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
the reason for that being he's going to
be trying a lot of stand-up things

558
