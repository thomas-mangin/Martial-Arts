00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
and then back into
 

183
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,429
and then back into
the mouth position

184
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
the mouth position
 

185
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,229

uh you're alive the whole time they give
 

189
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,830
uh you're alive the whole time they give
you an opening you take the opening

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840

 

191
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,229

stop stop you got to make sure when you

205
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,990

you have a you have a sequence to get to

206
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
you have a you have a sequence to get to
 

207
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,430
you have a you have a sequence to get to
you're going to give him an opening that

208
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
you're going to give him an opening that
 

209
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,830
you're going to give him an opening that
he's looking for you'll go back in side

210
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
he's looking for you'll go back in side
 

211
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,029
he's looking for you'll go back in side
control

212
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
control
 

213
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,990
control
okay

214
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
okay
 

215
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,990
okay
and make that mistake bring your knees

216
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
and make that mistake bring your knees
 

217
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,990
and make that mistake bring your knees
together as you're mounting

218
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
together as you're mounting
 

219
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,830
together as you're mounting
look for it

220
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
look for it
 

221
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,189
look for it
good

222
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199

 

223
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:26,150

tight

224
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160

 

225
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:43,510

try to work your way out good

226
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520

 

227
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,590

okay

228
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
okay
 

229
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,510
okay
i can't get in

230
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
i can't get in
 

231
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,870
i can't get in
can't get in

232
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
can't get in
 

233
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,590
can't get in
if he can't get out

234
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
if he can't get out
 

235
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,790
if he can't get out
and he's not moving okay

236
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
and he's not moving okay
 

237
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,830
and he's not moving okay
so

238
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
so
 

239
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,469
so
i'm going to be ballistic

240
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
i'm going to be ballistic
 

241
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,830
i'm going to be ballistic
so my my movement is

242
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
so my my movement is
 

243
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,150
so my my movement is
you see that that was enough i got

244
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
you see that that was enough i got
 

245
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,270
you see that that was enough i got
enough room on both sides there okay

246
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
enough room on both sides there okay
 

247
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,029
enough room on both sides there okay
but

248
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
but
 

249
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,749
but
it's not it's ballistic nature that's

250
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
it's not it's ballistic nature that's
 

251
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,189
it's not it's ballistic nature that's
making it work

252
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
making it work
 

253
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,309
making it work
okay

254
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
okay
 

255
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,790
okay
so i'm not trying to build momentum and

256
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
so i'm not trying to build momentum and
 

257
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,710
so i'm not trying to build momentum and
that's what's working okay

258
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
that's what's working okay
 

259
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,629
that's what's working okay
so hold me down

260
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
so hold me down
 

261
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,990
so hold me down
hold me down

262
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800

 

265
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,230

you see push down

266
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240

 

267
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,590

same way

268
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600

 

269
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,320

there's my space he's gonna come back

278
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
there's my space he's gonna come back
 

279
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,950
there's my space he's gonna come back
right

280
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
right
 

281

again i'm going to do it ballistically

288
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
again i'm going to do it ballistically
 

289
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,029
again i'm going to do it ballistically
right so

290
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
right so
 

291
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,990
right so
ballistically

292
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000

 

293
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,790

but its structure hold me down hold it

294
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
but its structure hold me down hold it
 

295
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,670
but its structure hold me down hold it
tight

296
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680

 

297
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,510

you see

298
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520

 

299
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,909

you're gonna hold me down

300
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
you're gonna hold me down
 

301
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,749
you're gonna hold me down
here april

302
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
here april
 

303
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,029
here april
oh

oh
 

305
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,670
oh
again it's done ballistically

306
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680

 

307
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,550

holding down

309
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,589

you see

310
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599

so again
 

321
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:48,869
so again
try to try to move

322
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879

 

323
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,830
