[Music]

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000

 

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,150

Okay. So now when you do

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
Okay. So now when you do
 

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,870
Okay. So now when you do
kokuho,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
kokuho,
 

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,510
kokuho,
you're going to use

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
you're going to use
 

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,189
you're going to use
your yong aspect, his yong aspect, but

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
your yong aspect, his yong aspect, but
 

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,990
your yong aspect, his yong aspect, but
you can use the yong aspects of the

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
you can use the yong aspects of the
 

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,910
you can use the yong aspects of the
centrifugal and centripal energy. Okay?

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
centrifugal and centripal energy. Okay?
 

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,069
centrifugal and centripal energy. Okay?
And you can use one hand

16
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
And you can use one hand
 

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,549
And you can use one hand
via those forces to generate the

18
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
via those forces to generate the
 

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,069
via those forces to generate the
adhesion on the other hand. Okay. So

20
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
adhesion on the other hand. Okay. So
 

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,470
adhesion on the other hand. Okay. So
when we go to play

22
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
when we go to play
 

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,150
when we go to play
the

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
the
 

25
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,830
the
you got to just kind of watch out for

26
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
you got to just kind of watch out for
 

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,110
you got to just kind of watch out for
the mic. Okay. When we go to play the co

28
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
the mic. Okay. When we go to play the co
 

29
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,590
the mic. Okay. When we go to play the co
game, there's there's a stickiness.

30
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
game, there's there's a stickiness.
 

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,590
game, there's there's a stickiness.
There's a stickiness here. So

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
There's a stickiness here. So
 

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,869
There's a stickiness here. So
I'm not going to slip up. Okay. It's not

34
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
I'm not going to slip up. Okay. It's not
 

35
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,229
I'm not going to slip up. Okay. It's not
that I just parrying it to the inside

36
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
that I just parrying it to the inside
 

37
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,030
that I just parrying it to the inside
like that. I stick to it. Okay.

38
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
like that. I stick to it. Okay.
 

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:16,070
like that. I stick to it. Okay.
Does that

40
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080

 

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,990

Does that make sense? Okay. So, let I

42
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
Does that make sense? Okay. So, let I
 

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,429
Does that make sense? Okay. So, let I
have I have his initial force. Do you

44
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
have I have his initial force. Do you
 

45
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,630
have I have his initial force. Do you
see that? I that I can use to

46
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
see that? I that I can use to
 

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,350
see that? I that I can use to
internalize to generate

48
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
internalize to generate
 

49
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,550
internalize to generate
the alchemical yong coming back. Okay.

50
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
the alchemical yong coming back. Okay.
 

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,910
the alchemical yong coming back. Okay.
But I can make sure that this hand is

52
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
But I can make sure that this hand is
 

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,789
But I can make sure that this hand is
not taking the energy off. Okay. So if I

54
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
not taking the energy off. Okay. So if I
 

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,749
not taking the energy off. Okay. So if I
like for example try to take that that

56
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
like for example try to take that that
 

57
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,950
like for example try to take that that
way, you see how it came off. Okay. I

58
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
way, you see how it came off. Okay. I
 

59
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,350
way, you see how it came off. Okay. I
have to use that this energy to keep

60
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
have to use that this energy to keep
 

61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,990
have to use that this energy to keep
there's the weight that I want. Okay? Do

62
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
there's the weight that I want. Okay? Do
 

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,950
there's the weight that I want. Okay? Do
do you guys understand that? So, you

64
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
do you guys understand that? So, you
 

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,109
do you guys understand that? So, you
have to always feel

66
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
have to always feel
 

67
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,389
have to always feel
>> what what you want to happen and never

68
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
>> what what you want to happen and never
 

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,190
>> what what you want to happen and never
take it never take it off.

70
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
take it never take it off.
 

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:14,470
take it never take it off.
>> Okay? until you

72
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480

 

73
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,110

until you you're like, "Oh, I I want to

74
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
until you you're like, "Oh, I I want to
 

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,430
until you you're like, "Oh, I I want to
disrupt with CoQ." Okay. But when we're

76
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
disrupt with CoQ." Okay. But when we're
 

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:38,229
disrupt with CoQ." Okay. But when we're
not working in grips, you have to do co

78
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239

 

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,670

do from iiki. Does that make sense? So

80
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
do from iiki. Does that make sense? So
 

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,670
do from iiki. Does that make sense? So
when you when you grip like that, you

82
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
when you when you grip like that, you
 

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,589
when you when you grip like that, you
can do all you could do that because

84
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
can do all you could do that because
 

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,949
can do all you could do that because
he's holding on. Okay. But on the on the

86
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
he's holding on. Okay. But on the on the
 

87
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:57,830
he's holding on. Okay. But on the on the
in the game, you always have to

88
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840

 

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:07,350

have to adhere to uh to project.

90
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360

 

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,790

Does that make sense?

92
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
Does that make sense?
 

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,110
Does that make sense?
>> Okay. So, we're going to try it. And um

94
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
>> Okay. So, we're going to try it. And um
 

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,750
>> Okay. So, we're going to try it. And um
again, the UK doesn't do anything. And

96
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
again, the UK doesn't do anything. And
 

97
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,270
again, the UK doesn't do anything. And
you have to try now dynamically to feed

98
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
you have to try now dynamically to feed
 

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,750
you have to try now dynamically to feed
the adhesion. Okay? And dynamically keep

100
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
the adhesion. Okay? And dynamically keep
 

101
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,390
the adhesion. Okay? And dynamically keep
it being fed by whatever you're doing on

102
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
it being fed by whatever you're doing on
 

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,070
it being fed by whatever you're doing on
the other hand. And you can you're going

104
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
the other hand. And you can you're going
 

105
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,830
the other hand. And you can you're going
to find you can only project through the

106
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
to find you can only project through the
 

107
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,509
to find you can only project through the
adhesion because we're not grabbing

108
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
adhesion because we're not grabbing
 

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,149
adhesion because we're not grabbing
anyone. Okay. Don't look for ledges too.

110
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
anyone. Okay. Don't look for ledges too.
 

111
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,190
anyone. Okay. Don't look for ledges too.
Okay. Try it.

112
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay. Try it.
 

113
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,470
Okay. Try it.
Okay. So, if I

114
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
Okay. So, if I
 

115
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,149
Okay. So, if I
go ahead if I have to like push, do you

116
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
go ahead if I have to like push, do you
 

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,550
go ahead if I have to like push, do you
see to get this

118
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
see to get this
 

119
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,830
see to get this
then I'm going to try to have to

120
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
then I'm going to try to have to
 

121
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,190
then I'm going to try to have to
overpower you. Okay. It also eventually

122
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
overpower you. Okay. It also eventually
 

123
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,550
overpower you. Okay. It also eventually
you're going to get you're going to

124
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
you're going to get you're going to
 

125
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,470
you're going to get you're going to
start to lose. Okay? Because right now I

126
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
start to lose. Okay? Because right now I
 

127
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,830
start to lose. Okay? Because right now I
I you're stuck. True. What's your spine

128
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
I you're stuck. True. What's your spine
 

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,869
I you're stuck. True. What's your spine
doing? It's it's just perfectly

130
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
doing? It's it's just perfectly
 

131
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,750
doing? It's it's just perfectly
balanced. Do you understand? Okay. So,

132
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
balanced. Do you understand? Okay. So,
 

133
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,270
balanced. Do you understand? Okay. So,
if I just yield a little. Do you see?

134
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
if I just yield a little. Do you see?
 

135
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,190
if I just yield a little. Do you see?
So, stay where you are, please. And then

136
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
So, stay where you are, please. And then
 

137
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,110
So, stay where you are, please. And then
you'll feel that. Do you see?

138
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
you'll feel that. Do you see?
 

139
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,550
you'll feel that. Do you see?
>> That's right there.

140
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
>> That's right there.
 

141
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,229
>> That's right there.
>> Okay.

142
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
>> Okay.
 

143
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,270
>> Okay.
Okay.

144
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280

 

145
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,189

We'll go back to where we were.

146
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
We'll go back to where we were.
 

147
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,550
We'll go back to where we were.
>> Okay. So, so here we are. And then this

148
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
>> Okay. So, so here we are. And then this
 

149
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,110
>> Okay. So, so here we are. And then this
this one too, you kind of feel stay

150
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
this one too, you kind of feel stay
 

151
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,790
this one too, you kind of feel stay
where you are. Stay where you are. And

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
you see? So all that happened because
 

157
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,990
you see? So all that happened because
from here I just shifted adhered. Okay.

158
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000

 

159
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,390

So you got to watch the the need. You're

160
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
So you got to watch the the need. You're
 

161
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,749
So you got to watch the the need. You're
coming in and you're like here. Okay. It

162
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
coming in and you're like here. Okay. It
 

163
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,110
coming in and you're like here. Okay. It
should be you come in and I move.

164
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120

 

165
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:09,590

You come in, I touch. Move.

166
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600

 

167
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,990

touch stuck.

168
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000

 

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,150

I can move out of the way. There it is

170
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
I can move out of the way. There it is
 

171
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,110
I can move out of the way. There it is
right there. So, I use that right. I go

172
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
right there. So, I use that right. I go
 

173
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,469
right there. So, I use that right. I go
back. I can project.

174
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
back. I can project.
 

175
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,629
back. I can project.
You got to mix it up. But you got to get

176
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
You got to mix it up. But you got to get
 

177
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,029
You got to mix it up. But you got to get
the spine to tilt. And the only way you

178
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
the spine to tilt. And the only way you
 

179
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,270
the spine to tilt. And the only way you
can get the spine to tilt is you have to

180
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
can get the spine to tilt is you have to
 

181
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,990
can get the spine to tilt is you have to
yin yield with an adhesion. Okay. So I

182
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
yin yield with an adhesion. Okay. So I
 

183
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,029
yin yield with an adhesion. Okay. So I
have to adhere.

184
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
have to adhere.
 

185
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,390
have to adhere.
>> Go back.

186
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
>> Go back.
 

187
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,510
>> Go back.
>> Not contest. And then you go around me

188
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
>> Not contest. And then you go around me
 

189
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,830
>> Not contest. And then you go around me
like he is. And now you Okay. I got

190
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
like he is. And now you Okay. I got
 

191
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,230
like he is. And now you Okay. I got
another contest. Contesting angle. And

192
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
another contest. Contesting angle. And
 

193
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,070
another contest. Contesting angle. And
you go around me and I got another

194
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
you go around me and I got another
 

195
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,150
you go around me and I got another
contesting angle. Do you see? And then

196
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
contesting angle. Do you see? And then
 

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,510
contesting angle. Do you see? And then
you finally go just use the initial

198
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
you finally go just use the initial
 

199
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,070
you finally go just use the initial
effort

200
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
effort
 

201
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,469
effort
to

202
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479

 

203
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,430

to find it. And so I want you to make

204
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
to find it. And so I want you to make
 

205
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,909
to find it. And so I want you to make
sure his spine is tilting.

206
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
sure his spine is tilting.
 

207
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,230
sure his spine is tilting.
>> Okay? So you're going to have some

208
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
>> Okay? So you're going to have some
 

209
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,350
>> Okay? So you're going to have some
intention to move here. Do you see that?

210
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
intention to move here. Do you see that?
 

211
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,270
intention to move here. Do you see that?
Okay. And so that's the one I I'm gonna

212
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
Okay. And so that's the one I I'm gonna
 

213
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,629
Okay. And so that's the one I I'm gonna
yield, but I'm going to yield with with

214
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
yield, but I'm going to yield with with
 

215
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,070
yield, but I'm going to yield with with
an adhesion.

216
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080

 

217
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,430

Do you get that?

218
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
Do you get that?
 

219
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,029
Do you get that?
>> Okay. So, where I want you to put your

220
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
>> Okay. So, where I want you to put your
 

221
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,350
>> Okay. So, where I want you to put your
attention is, is he still staying

222
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
attention is, is he still staying
 

223
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,909
attention is, is he still staying
straight up or have I got his spine

224
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
straight up or have I got his spine
 

225
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,749
straight up or have I got his spine
tilting? Okay.

226
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
tilting? Okay.
 

227
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,830
tilting? Okay.
>> And then I think the adhesions might

228
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
>> And then I think the adhesions might
 

229
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,270
>> And then I think the adhesions might
show up. Okay. Try it. All right. So, he

230
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
show up. Okay. Try it. All right. So, he
 

231
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,350
show up. Okay. Try it. All right. So, he
he's actually making it easy for you.

232
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
he's actually making it easy for you.
 

233
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,790
he's actually making it easy for you.
He's just going like that. Okay. So,

234
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
He's just going like that. Okay. So,
 

235
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,029
He's just going like that. Okay. So,
that's all it is. This is like zombie

236
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
that's all it is. This is like zombie
 

237
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,350
that's all it is. This is like zombie
zombie 101. Remember we started out with

238
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
zombie 101. Remember we started out with
 

239
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,790
zombie 101. Remember we started out with
zombie drills. Yes.

240
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
zombie drills. Yes.
 

241
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,749
zombie drills. Yes.
>> So, when you go in, look

242
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
>> So, when you go in, look
 

243
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,390
>> So, when you go in, look
like you could do that. You could do

244
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
like you could do that. You could do
 

245
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,189
like you could do that. You could do
this. So, let's go back and see.

246
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
this. So, let's go back and see.
 

247
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,950
this. So, let's go back and see.
>> Okay. I have two inward spirals. You see

248
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
>> Okay. I have two inward spirals. You see
 

249
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,270
>> Okay. I have two inward spirals. You see
to the adhesion right here.

250
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
to the adhesion right here.
 

251
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,110
to the adhesion right here.
>> Okay. I could do an inward spiral here

252
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
>> Okay. I could do an inward spiral here
 

253
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,350
>> Okay. I could do an inward spiral here
and take this one here this way. So, I'm

254
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
and take this one here this way. So, I'm
 

255
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,990
and take this one here this way. So, I'm
on the outside and the inside. Does that

256
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
on the outside and the inside. Does that
 

257
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,550
on the outside and the inside. Does that
make sense?

258
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
make sense?
 

259
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,029
make sense?
>> Yes.

260
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
>> Yes.
 

261
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,830
>> Yes.
>> Okay. I'm here like this. I could be on

262
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
>> Okay. I'm here like this. I could be on
 

263
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,070
>> Okay. I'm here like this. I could be on
top angle and then I have the X pattern

264
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
top angle and then I have the X pattern
 

265
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,390
top angle and then I have the X pattern
there which you use one time. But what

266
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
there which you use one time. But what
 

267
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,309
there which you use one time. But what
I'm not going to do is be here like

268
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
I'm not going to do is be here like
 

269
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm not going to do is be here like
this.

270
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
this.
 

271
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,749
this.
>> Right?

272
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
>> Right?
 

273
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,670
>> Right?
>> Your energy's coming in. I change

274
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
>> Your energy's coming in. I change
 

275
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,589
>> Your energy's coming in. I change
angles.

276
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
angles.
 

277
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,390
angles.
Energy's coming in. Change angles. And

what you what you're feeling on that
 

281
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,589
what you what you're feeling on that
projection is the adhesion. Do do you

282
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
projection is the adhesion. Do do you
 

283
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,870
projection is the adhesion. Do do you
get do you understand what I mean by

284
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
get do you understand what I mean by
 

285
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,510
get do you understand what I mean by
that? Yes sir.

286
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
that? Yes sir.
 

287
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,950
that? Yes sir.
>> So I'm loading you. It's right there.

288
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
>> So I'm loading you. It's right there.
 

289
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,589
>> So I'm loading you. It's right there.
Okay. Which you can use. You can use

290
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
Okay. Which you can use. You can use
 

291
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,710
Okay. Which you can use. You can use
that or you can just go this way.

292
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
that or you can just go this way.
 

293
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,790
that or you can just go this way.
But I make the connection. So look what

294
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
But I make the connection. So look what
 

295
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,869
But I make the connection. So look what
I did at the beginning. Whoa. I'm on the

296
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
I did at the beginning. Whoa. I'm on the
 

297
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,909
I did at the beginning. Whoa. I'm on the
inside. Do you see? Find the adhesion.

298
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
inside. Do you see? Find the adhesion.
 

299
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,749
inside. Do you see? Find the adhesion.
This one's kind of weak there. Do you

300
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
This one's kind of weak there. Do you
 

301
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,270
This one's kind of weak there. Do you
see that? Do you feel that?

302
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
see that? Do you feel that?
 

303
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,909
see that? Do you feel that?
>> Okay. So you could take it around and

304
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
>> Okay. So you could take it around and
 

305
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,869
>> Okay. So you could take it around and
use this one more.

306
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879

 

307
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,510

You can find that the the little fear.

308
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
You can find that the the little fear.
 

309
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,350
You can find that the the little fear.
So what I'm doing here is getting you

310
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
So what I'm doing here is getting you
 

311
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,110
So what I'm doing here is getting you
more out. Do you see that?

312
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
more out. Do you see that?
 

313
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,950
more out. Do you see that?
>> And then that's where you tense and then

314
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
>> And then that's where you tense and then
 

315
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,150
>> And then that's where you tense and then
that becomes projectionable. Okay.

316
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
that becomes projectionable. Okay.
 

317
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,230
that becomes projectionable. Okay.
>> But I'm finding the feeling. So again,

318
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
>> But I'm finding the feeling. So again,
 

319
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,749
>> But I'm finding the feeling. So again,
here you are. You're coming in. Look how

320
