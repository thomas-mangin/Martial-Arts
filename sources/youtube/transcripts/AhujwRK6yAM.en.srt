00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640

 

185
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,550

arms that's why you see

186
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:19,560
arms that's why you see
 

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,269
arms that's why you see
him kind of float for a second my cush

188
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
him kind of float for a second my cush
 

189
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:32,330
him kind of float for a second my cush
is in the way

190
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,340

195
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,310

better you have to look for that just

196
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,320
better you have to look for that just
 

197
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,230
better you have to look for that just
like on E it's right

198

like on E it's right
here okay so on this

200
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:54,839
here okay so on this
 

201
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,949
here okay so on this
technique you're

202
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
technique you're
 

203
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,230
technique you're
doing you're doing k

204
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,240
doing you're doing k
 

205
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,110

right
 

207
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,710
right
here but on the other

208
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720

 

209
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,470

side other hand I on me there it is it's

hand and then you're doing the

214
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:15,639
hand and then you're doing the
 

215
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,190
hand and then you're doing the
Y right

216
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,200
Y right
 

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,430

219
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,949

arm you go right

220
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:25,959
arm you go right
 

221
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,269
arm you go right
there okay try

222
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:30,279
there okay try
 

223
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,470
there okay try
so now if you pay

224
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
so now if you pay
 

225
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,710
so now if you pay
attention what's making him fall as he

226
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:35,720
attention what's making him fall as he
 

227
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,670
attention what's making him fall as he
comes around

228
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
comes around
 

229
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,430
comes around
right okay it's the same x pattern for

230
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
right okay it's the same x pattern for
 

231
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,870
right okay it's the same x pattern for
the front inward

232
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
the front inward
 

233
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,069
the front inward
position so that means his head has to

234
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:47,079
position so that means his head has to
 

235
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,430
position so that means his head has to
go this

236
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,440
go this
 

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,430
go this
way that will generate his leg to go

238
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
way that will generate his leg to go
 

239
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,430
way that will generate his leg to go
that way with a centrifical energy which

240
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
that way with a centrifical energy which
 

241
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,030
that way with a centrifical energy which
is also initiated by my spiral and

242
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
is also initiated by my spiral and
 

243
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,949
is also initiated by my spiral and
footwork and then this leg

244
00:11:59,949 --> 00:11:59,959
footwork and then this leg
 

245
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,550
footwork and then this leg
I will project out

246
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
I will project out
 

247
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,069
I will project out
okay so the Hound are what are doing

248
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:09,079

that okay the
 

251
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,509
that okay the
hands are making him do this with his

252
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:18,519
hands are making him do this with his
 

253
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,069
hands are making him do this with his
head so don't rip your hands out of his

254
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:23,079
head so don't rip your hands out of his
 

255
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,910
head so don't rip your hands out of his
grip as you're trying to accelerate them

256
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:26,920
grip as you're trying to accelerate them
 

257
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,710

you need to you want to stay in there

258
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:29,720
you need to you want to stay in there
 

259
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,389
you need to you want to stay in there
okay and as you watch me go my hands

260
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:33,399
okay and as you watch me go my hands
 

261
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,110
okay and as you watch me go my hands
aren't moving all that fast and

262
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
aren't moving all that fast and
 

263
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,550
aren't moving all that fast and
they're analyzing always for the I

264
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
they're analyzing always for the I
 

265
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,030
they're analyzing always for the I
adhesion inside his palms so that I keep

266
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
adhesion inside his palms so that I keep
 

267
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,470
adhesion inside his palms so that I keep
him loaded on the hip and I just keep it

268

him loaded on the hip and I just keep it
 

269
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,790
him loaded on the hip and I just keep it
teetering as we're going along it

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:49,800
teetering as we're going along it
 

271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,470
teetering as we're going along it
doesn't stop so it's constant motion and

272
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
doesn't stop so it's constant motion and
 

273
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,189
doesn't stop so it's constant motion and
there's no ripping my hands out okay so

274
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:56,199
there's no ripping my hands out okay so
 

275
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,389
there's no ripping my hands out okay so
one

277
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,990

I see my hands are moving relatively

278
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
I see my hands are moving relatively
 

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:18,590
I see my hands are moving relatively
slow it's the hip that's doing

280
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,600

 

281
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,110

it don't make the

282
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
it don't make the
 

283
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,030
it don't make the
mistake of seeing it as an acceleration

284
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
mistake of seeing it as an acceleration
 

285
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,590
mistake of seeing it as an acceleration
go okay try it again don't rip your your

hands out of their grip match the yog
 

289
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,389
hands out of their grip match the yog
value so you have adhesion at the

290
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
