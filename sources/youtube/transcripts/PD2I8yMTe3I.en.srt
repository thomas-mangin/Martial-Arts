179
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,629

so you just walk that's it but this is

180
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639

don't leave this out and you're gonna
feel the downwardness of this

202
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120

 

203
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,430

this move right here i'm going to
start the descent this one

216
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
start the descent this one
 

217
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,790

i need to get him in the front inward
 

223
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,670
i need to get him in the front inward
position you're going to step

224
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
position you're going to step
 

225
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,670
position you're going to step
in right try it again

226
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
in right try it again
 

227
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,710

i need to get his head low so his hip
can go out

230
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
can go out
 

231
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,350
can go out
now that to do that

232
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
now that to do that

now that to do that
i have to get on the inside of his arm

234
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
i have to get on the inside of his arm
 

235
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,550
i have to get on the inside of his arm
the inside

236
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
the inside
 

237
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,430
the inside
let's go to the joe stay there you

238
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
let's go to the joe stay there you
 

239
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,350
let's go to the joe stay there you
already know this technique

240
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
already know this technique
 

241
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,909
already know this technique
this is where you do your songkills and

242
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
this is where you do your songkills and
 

243
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,350
this is where you do your songkills and
things like that

244
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
things like that
 

245
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,350
things like that
okay so he tries to stand up

246
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
okay so he tries to stand up
 

247
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,029
okay so he tries to stand up
you see it's not the obvious

248
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
you see it's not the obvious
 

249
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,870
you see it's not the obvious
joint on joint okay

250
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880

 

251
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,830

so this arm's not cosmetic nor going

252
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
so this arm's not cosmetic nor going
 

253
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,830
so this arm's not cosmetic nor going
that way

254
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840

 

255
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,869

it has to start the descent so i get

256
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
it has to start the descent so i get
 

257
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,909
it has to start the descent so i get
that curve

258
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
that curve
 

259
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,629
that curve
let go right i help get this leg there

260
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
let go right i help get this leg there
 

261
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,749
let go right i help get this leg there
rewind the film back

262
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
rewind the film back
 

263
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:04,550
rewind the film back
by pushing it out

264
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560

 

265
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,710

so head takes weight off of that leg

266
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
so head takes weight off of that leg
 

267
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,390
so head takes weight off of that leg
and i push it out

268
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400

 

269
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,469

do you get the body lock oh

270
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
do you get the body lock oh
 

271
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,749
do you get the body lock oh
this is going to go down in

272
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759

 

273
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,950

push it's not up to him whether he rolls

274
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
push it's not up to him whether he rolls
 

275
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,909
push it's not up to him whether he rolls
or not

276
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
or not
 

277
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,070
or not
okay go so uh

278
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
okay go so uh
 

279
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,630
okay go so uh
same technique but in principle but

280
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
same technique but in principle but
 

281
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,190
same technique but in principle but
different

282
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
different
 

283
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,469
different
okay so remember a guy it's very common

okay so remember a guy it's very common
 

285
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,029
okay so remember a guy it's very common
when you

286
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
when you
 

287
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,509
when you
when people are searching they they

288
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
when people are searching they they

that they're tying incorrectly
 

297
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,389
that they're tying incorrectly
so this one he's walking i'm going to

298
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
so this one he's walking i'm going to
 

299
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,670
so this one he's walking i'm going to
bring him into that same circle

300
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
bring him into that same circle
 

301
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,630
bring him into that same circle
so this time last time we did this hand

302
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
so this time last time we did this hand
 

303
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,389
so this time last time we did this hand
this time i use this town but i'm going

304
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
this time i use this town but i'm going
 

305
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,670
this time i use this town but i'm going
to be in that safe circle

306
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
to be in that safe circle
 

307
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,070
to be in that safe circle
so if i'm not gonna go here whoa

308
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
so if i'm not gonna go here whoa
 

309
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,670
so if i'm not gonna go here whoa
i have to get inside the same circle so

310
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
i have to get inside the same circle so
 

311
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,829
i have to get inside the same circle so
boom inside the center

312
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

313
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:31,030

boom

314
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040

 

315
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,190

then we're going to take advantage of

316
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
then we're going to take advantage of
 

317
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,070
then we're going to take advantage of
this

318
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
this
 

319
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,150
this
this leverage right there

320
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160

 

321
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:48,829

do the same thing boom this way

322
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

323
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,150

okay

324
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
okay
 

325
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,829
okay
this way

326
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839

 

327
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,630

you want boom

328
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
you want boom
 

329
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,990
you want boom
this way

330
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000

 

331
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:26,550

then you do the same injury

332
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560

 

333
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,710

the part you pull down is that that

334
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
the part you pull down is that that
 

335
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,790
the part you pull down is that that
gives you your head tilt

336
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
gives you your head tilt
 

337
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:41,350
gives you your head tilt
adds to it in

338
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360

 

339
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,829

same push through the center on the

340
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
same push through the center on the
 

341
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:52,710
same push through the center on the
right

342
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720

 

343
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,630

make sure this is going around you so

344
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
make sure this is going around you so
 

345
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:10,870
make sure this is going around you so
that you enter inside of it

346
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880

 

347
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720

hey hey
