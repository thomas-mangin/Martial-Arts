5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,670
going to talk about my eighth Kum Joe so
my eighth Kum Joe is very similar to

6
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:06,680
my eighth Kum Joe is very similar to
 

7
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,190
my eighth Kum Joe is very similar to
cyos Sensei fourth Kum Joe um it's

8
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,200
cyos Sensei fourth Kum Joe um it's
 

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,509
cyos Sensei fourth Kum Joe um it's
getting into the series that in my

10
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:12,519
getting into the series that in my
 

11
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,310
getting into the series that in my
opinion is less likely to come off and

12
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:15,320
opinion is less likely to come off and
 

13
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,349
opinion is less likely to come off and
would only come off more in kind of a

14
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
would only come off more in kind of a
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,830
would only come off more in kind of a
panic state or in a state where you

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
panic state or in a state where you
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,830
panic state or in a state where you
could kind of mess around because you're

18
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
could kind of mess around because you're
 

19
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,990
could kind of mess around because you're
you're better than them right so so it's

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
you're better than them right so so it's
 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,790
you're better than them right so so it's
like this lower percentage stuff in my

22
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
like this lower percentage stuff in my
 

23
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,589
like this lower percentage stuff in my
opinion so I'm gonna get Josh over here

24
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:28,599
opinion so I'm gonna get Josh over here
 

25
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,389
opinion so I'm gonna get Josh over here
and we're going to go to work Josh

Sabuy video when we make the saaby video
but I'm going to grab up here now if you

46
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
but I'm going to grab up here now if you
 

47
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,590
but I'm going to grab up here now if you
think about it

48
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
think about it
 

49
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,110
think about it
in some ways it's kind of easier to grab

50
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
in some ways it's kind of easier to grab
 

51
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,750
in some ways it's kind of easier to grab
the stick this way um if I hit it and it

52
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
the stick this way um if I hit it and it
 

53
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,310
the stick this way um if I hit it and it
came back this would be easier to grab

54
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
came back this would be easier to grab
 

55
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,310
came back this would be easier to grab
and if I just reached out and this is

56
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,320
and if I just reached out and this is
 

57
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,429
and if I just reached out and this is
easier because I don't have to sink down

58
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
easier because I don't have to sink down
 

59
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,910
easier because I don't have to sink down
to get it and when I pull it back this

60
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
to get it and when I pull it back this
 

61
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,670
to get it and when I pull it back this
way I really specifically have to try to

62
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
way I really specifically have to try to
 

63
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,390
way I really specifically have to try to
bring it to this hand so if I was going

64
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,400
bring it to this hand so if I was going
 

65
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,590
bring it to this hand so if I was going
to freak out this kind of freak out

66
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
to freak out this kind of freak out
 

67
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,910
to freak out this kind of freak out
might be more common um I think it is

68
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
might be more common um I think it is
 

69
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,230
might be more common um I think it is
from my own experience maybe that's true

70
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,240
from my own experience maybe that's true
 

71
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,830
from my own experience maybe that's true
or not for you but it is definitely a

72
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
or not for you but it is definitely a
 

73
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,270
or not for you but it is definitely a
way that it might come back to grab the

74
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
way that it might come back to grab the
 

75
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,069
way that it might come back to grab the
hand okay so in this we're going to be

76
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:28,079
hand okay so in this we're going to be
 

77
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,590
hand okay so in this we're going to be
in the configuration we've seen ever

78
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
in the configuration we've seen ever
 

79
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,670
in the configuration we've seen ever
since

80
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,680
since
 

81
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,310
since

range and I'm in Joe Kamai and
unprepared situation at that range when

88
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
unprepared situation at that range when
 

89
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,149
unprepared situation at that range when
Josh comes in for the ski I'm going to

90
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
Josh comes in for the ski I'm going to

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,230
shoot back far and I didn't jump back as
far as I normally would because uh the

98
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
far as I normally would because uh the
 

99
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,950
far as I normally would because uh the
camera but uh I'm trying to hop back

102
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:53,079
really far I want to hop back far enough
 

103
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,749
really far I want to hop back far enough
that if he came in for a second ski it

104
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
that if he came in for a second ski it
 

105
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,350
that if he came in for a second ski it
wouldn't work okay now we know from the

106
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,360
wouldn't work okay now we know from the
 

107
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,310
wouldn't work okay now we know from the
forms then that what Josh should do is

108
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
forms then that what Josh should do is
 

109
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,270
forms then that what Josh should do is
go jodan guch but if you notice what I

110
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
go jodan guch but if you notice what I
 

111
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,630
go jodan guch but if you notice what I
did I came into a defended position for

112
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
did I came into a defended position for
 

113
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,949
did I came into a defended position for
jodan guch which is fantastic so if I'm

114
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
jodan guch which is fantastic so if I'm
 

115
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,710
jodan guch which is fantastic so if I'm
mentally ahead enough to realize that

116
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
mentally ahead enough to realize that
 

117
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,630
mentally ahead enough to realize that
I'm not in a dangered position and he

118
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
I'm not in a dangered position and he
 

119
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm not in a dangered position and he
transitions to jodu I can do this which

120
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
transitions to jodu I can do this which
 

121
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,070
transitions to jodu I can do this which
I pull myself back even further and I

122
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
I pull myself back even further and I
 

123
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,790
I pull myself back even further and I
whack him in the hand when that's going

124
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
whack him in the hand when that's going
 

125
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,589
whack him in the hand when that's going
on right so this is a clever tactical

126
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:22,599
on right so this is a clever tactical
 

127
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,750
on right so this is a clever tactical
idea in my opinion that's like well I

128
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
idea in my opinion that's like well I
 

129
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,350
idea in my opinion that's like well I
made the best out of a kind of crummy

130
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,360
made the best out of a kind of crummy
 

131
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,309
made the best out of a kind of crummy
situation in my opinion this position's

132
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
situation in my opinion this position's
 

133
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,030
situation in my opinion this position's
harder to work from but I me made it

134
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,040
harder to work from but I me made it
 

135
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,229
harder to work from but I me made it
work for me so when joshh comes in and I

136
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,239
work for me so when joshh comes in and I
 

137
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,550
work for me so when joshh comes in and I
hop back like this I'm already defended

138
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:35,560
hop back like this I'm already defended
 

139
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,309
hop back like this I'm already defended
against what Josh is going to do and so

140
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,319
against what Josh is going to do and so
 

141
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,190
against what Josh is going to do and so
if Josh tries to do what the forms have

142
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
if Josh tries to do what the forms have
 

143
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,030
if Josh tries to do what the forms have
been teaching us to do as he goes to do

144
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
been teaching us to do as he goes to do
 

145
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,750
been teaching us to do as he goes to do
that I can step back and I can pop that

146
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:42,760
that I can step back and I can pop that
 

147
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,030
that I can step back and I can pop that
hand and and hopefully disable it and

148
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
hand and and hopefully disable it and
 

149
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,270
hand and and hopefully disable it and
then we can deal with that okay however

150
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,280
then we can deal with that okay however
 

151
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,190
then we can deal with that okay however
Josh is going to see that I'm doing that

152
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
Josh is going to see that I'm doing that
 

153
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,790
Josh is going to see that I'm doing that
and he's going to use his own banin no

154
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
and he's going to use his own banin no
 

155
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,990
and he's going to use his own banin no
Kamai so as he comes in here he starts

156
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
Kamai so as he comes in here he starts
 

157
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Kamai so as he comes in here he starts

Kamai boom and he's safe now after I
 

167
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,869
Kamai boom and he's safe now after I
swing through there will be a time that

168
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
swing through there will be a time that
 

169
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,509
swing through there will be a time that
I'm a little bit vulnerable that I'm

170
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:08,519
I'm a little bit vulnerable that I'm
 

171
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,710
I'm a little bit vulnerable that I'm
here like this so what Josh's going to

172
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:09,720
here like this so what Josh's going to
 

173
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,350
here like this so what Josh's going to

do is step to the backside and give me a
Thrust bang that's what he's looking for

176
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
Thrust bang that's what he's looking for
 

177
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,430
Thrust bang that's what he's looking for
so as he goes to do that I step away

178
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
so as he goes to do that I step away
 

179
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,509
so as he goes to do that I step away
from that and I thrust him Center chest

180
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
from that and I thrust him Center chest
 

181
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,910
from that and I thrust him Center chest
right so uh I'm turning what should be a

182
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
right so uh I'm turning what should be a
 

183
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,869
right so uh I'm turning what should be a
kind of bad position this into just uh a

184
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
kind of bad position this into just uh a
 

185
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,190
kind of bad position this into just uh a
High Ski Joni so we're here as Josh

186
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
High Ski Joni so we're here as Josh
 

187
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,390
High Ski Joni so we're here as Josh
comes in I hop back like this as Josh

188
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,400
comes in I hop back like this as Josh
 

189
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,030
comes in I hop back like this as Josh
comes in I hop back he defends that he

190
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040

191
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,910

comes for me I step up and I thrust so
 

193
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,110
comes for me I step up and I thrust so
um the big thing we're seeing there is

194
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,120
um the big thing we're seeing there is
 

195
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,149
um the big thing we're seeing there is
that Outreach Outreach tactic which I

196
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
that Outreach Outreach tactic which I
 

197
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,509
that Outreach Outreach tactic which I
think is a nice tactic when they're

198
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
think is a nice tactic when they're
 

199
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,309
think is a nice tactic when they're
trying to run you down that's a huge

200
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
trying to run you down that's a huge
 

201
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,350
trying to run you down that's a huge
backwards movement so not only can I hop

202
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,360
backwards movement so not only can I hop
 

203
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,470
backwards movement so not only can I hop
back big this way but I can take a full

204
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
back big this way but I can take a full
 

205
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,910
back big this way but I can take a full
aumi AI back this way which really puts

206
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
aumi AI back this way which really puts
 

207
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,390
aumi AI back this way which really puts
me away from the danger zone so it's

208
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
me away from the danger zone so it's
 

209
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,589
me away from the danger zone so it's
really nice and I'm using my Tomo uch my

210
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,599
really nice and I'm using my Tomo uch my
 

211
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,190
really nice and I'm using my Tomo uch my
longest possible strike in order to deal

212
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
longest possible strike in order to deal
 

213
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,069
longest possible strike in order to deal
with that extra range advantage means I

214
00:03:59,069 --> 00:03:59,079
with that extra range advantage means I
 

215
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,589
with that extra range advantage means I
can still hit Josh can't hit me so again

216
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
can still hit Josh can't hit me so again
 

217
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,069
can still hit Josh can't hit me so again
we're seeing this idea in the last form

218
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,079
we're seeing this idea in the last form
 

219
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,910
we're seeing this idea in the last form
we kind of saw this idea that Kates can

220
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
we kind of saw this idea that Kates can
 

221
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,710
we kind of saw this idea that Kates can
beat kinis right now the problem with

222
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:07,720
beat kinis right now the problem with
 

223
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,990
beat kinis right now the problem with
the Kates is they tend to be less

224
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
the Kates is they tend to be less
 

225
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,390
the Kates is they tend to be less
controlling because there's only one

226
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:11,400
controlling because there's only one
 

227
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,069
controlling because there's only one
hand on this long stick so hard to deal

228
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,079
hand on this long stick so hard to deal
 

229
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,830
hand on this long stick so hard to deal
with that and so at the end of that we

230
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
with that and so at the end of that we
 

231
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,030
with that and so at the end of that we
see a way that I could manage if I use a

232
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
see a way that I could manage if I use a
 

233
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,390
see a way that I could manage if I use a
Tomo uch to come back and still still go

234
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,400
Tomo uch to come back and still still go
 

235
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,749
Tomo uch to come back and still still go
to work so form's pretty straightforward

236
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
to work so form's pretty straightforward
 

237
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,430
to work so form's pretty straightforward
in my opinion um I put it towards the

238
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
in my opinion um I put it towards the
 

239
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,870
in my opinion um I put it towards the
end because I don't think there's a

240
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
end because I don't think there's a
 

241
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,350
end because I don't think there's a
whole lot of amazing information in this

242
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
whole lot of amazing information in this
 

243
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,830
whole lot of amazing information in this
um although there's a great tactic and a

244
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:28,840
um although there's a great tactic and a
 

245
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,270
um although there's a great tactic and a
great idea and so it's still one of the

246
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
great idea and so it's still one of the
 

247
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,790
great idea and so it's still one of the
forms because I think there's cool stuff

248
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
forms because I think there's cool stuff
 

249
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,390
forms because I think there's cool stuff
in it um but that's the my basic take on

250
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
in it um but that's the my basic take on
 

251
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,029
in it um but that's the my basic take on
that uh and this is my eighth Kum Joe

252
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,039
that uh and this is my eighth Kum Joe
 

253
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,189
that uh and this is my eighth Kum Joe
