00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello Guillaume.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello Olivier.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,000
Very happy to have you here.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,760
It's me.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,160
We're in Youtube's premises.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,140
Yes, it's extraordinary,

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,600
beautiful studio.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,980
Obviously, the quality of production

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,720
is somewhat higher compared to what we've done so far.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,000
It's nice.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,040
It's nice, it's nice.

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,780
I thought I'd make it available to you

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,900
since it's with you that we first started the videos anyway.

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,960
Yes yes, and then it's a great adventure, and we continue.

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,300
We must continue to develop something,

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,720
quietly, without disturbing anyone, but showing that we can bring things.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,000
To begin,

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,700
I suggest to go back briefly on your journey

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,720
in aikido,

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,300
your beginnings, and then your departure for Japan.

21
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,220
Yeah ...

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,180
Quickly though...

23
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Okay, let's do it quickly, we've done it already,

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,460
so it's not worth spending too much  time on it because I'm not [that important]...

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,340
Basically, I started martial arts at the age of 5, I started with fencing,

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500
I did a little judo at school too, and

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,440
I practiced very intensively until about 14-15 years old.

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,280
At 14-15, as I was fencing with adults,

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,340
and always with the right hand, I had a bone deformity

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,780
and so I was forced to stop, and was told, "You should start swimming."

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,740
I said, "no thank you I don't like water that much."

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,900
"and I especially don't like pools."

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,740
So I was told, "find something that uses both hands", so I wanted to do kendo, which made sense.

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,620
I did some after, but at the time I was told,

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,280
"Not kendo, because the hands aren't parallel so don't do it."

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,180
So I said, "Well, I'm going to do karate."

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,940
I took my father to karate, he said, "my son, it's not for you."

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,260
So after that, by chance, there was another dojo not far from our house where they did aikido.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,600
When I was fencing at Paris University Club, there was a dojo where I had seen Aikido

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
so I said "Oh that's not bad, I hope I can do that one day"

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,320
And so I took my father to see Aikido and it was, by chance,

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,780
since I did not know him at the time,

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,200
it was André Nocquet who gave the lessons.

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,040
We sat down with my dad and we watched a class.

45
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,040
At the end, Nocquet came and he thought it was my father who was going to register,

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,820
and he said to my father, "So, are you interested to register?"

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,040
My dad said, "Not at all, but you can register my son."

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,800
And that's how I started Aikido.

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,580
Because my dad wasn't into martial arts.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,260
I started Aikido there, I was lucky because it was at the Dojo rue Servan ,

51
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,120
which subsequently burned so it no longer exists,

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,900
and the French kendo team was training there,

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,600
there were a lot of very interesting things.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,200
When Christian Tissier came back from Japan,

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,400
he started to teach there on Wednesdays I think at the dojo rue Servan once a week.

56
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,920
That's where I met Christian.

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,380
After that I went to Christian's dojo in Vincennes

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,080
so I was among his first students actually.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,220
We were 10 or 20 at the time.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
It happened like that.

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,340
When i saw Christian, I discovered an entirely new world.

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,740
He had so much panache, it was so extraordinary,

63
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,020
I told myself: "what he's got, he found it in Japan".

64
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
There was nobody at the time who did that.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,500
I told myself: "I have to go to Japan".

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,240
I was young, I was 17-18 years old,

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,480
and I say to Christian, "Well, I have to go to Japan."

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,180
And he said to me, "Come, I need to explain something to you"

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
"how much do you have in your bank account? "

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,100
I said, "Well, I worked all summer and all that," I was a kid,

71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,700
I think I think I had 3800 francs, which at the time, wasn't much.

72
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,340
And he said to me,

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,300
"Listen, it's simple, when you have 3 times more, we'll be able to think about you getting you to Japan."

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,780
As I never had that, I didn't go.

75
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,880
Time went on,

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I did my baccalaureate,

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,120
I did a BTS Assistant Engineer, after I did philosophy,

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,780
and when I finished my studies, I thought, "I'm never going to go."

79
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,340
So, I saved as much as I could and left for 3 months.

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,200
I've been here in Japan for the past 33 years now.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,420
I went back to France for a small period to attend some business but basically that's it.

82
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,860
So 33 years at the Aikikai, not not only, because I also went to other dojo, and I did  Daito-ryu too.

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,260
All of that goes together.

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,790
When I went to Japan I was already 3rd dan and now I'm 6th dan.

85
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,500
Those aren't  references that, they're just a journey.

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,360
That's my journey.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,060
In Japan, I was happy because even though I arrived after O Sensei's passing,

88
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,600
all the old Sensei of from the beginning of the Aikikai were still there,

89
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,680
except Chiba Sensei and Saotome Sensei, who had already left for the United States

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,900
but there were all the old ones, Yamaguchi Sensei, Arikawa Sensei,

91
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,000
Watanabe Sensei, Masuda Sensei, etc. they were about 20 Sensei.

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,060
And then, of course, there was Kisshomaru Ueshiba.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
He deeply impressed me,

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,220
just like he deeply marked Christian in fact,

95
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,720
because Christian is really an emanation of Kisshomaru, I think.

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,840
That's it, to put it simply.

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,160
Later on, I started Daito-ryu in Japan.

98
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,140
It's been about 15 years now, something like that.

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,360
My path is a bit chaotic but at the same time, it's always going in the same direction,

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,700
it's the search for the truth, it's the only thing that matters to me,

101
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,000
to try to find what is true and what isn't,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,920
to eliminate what isn't true, keep what's authentic and coherent.

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,820
There isn't  a lot of that if we look carefully.

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,760
It's a difficult path, it's not just about training, it's about also looking for,

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,020
in training and in what we are given in training

106
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,720
or in teaching, because it's also a teaching,

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,680
what is interesting for me first, but also what is interesting for the world in general.

108
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,160
And all that is false, all that is unauthentic for me,

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,400
- is not necessarily to be thrown in the trash, because it presents other interests, -

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,940
but it's a waste of time.

111
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,940
To put it simply.

112
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,960
What was the biggest difference between the Aikido you discovered in Japan at the Hombu Dojo compared to what you did in France?

113
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,460
It's a difficult question because it's a question

114
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,440
whose answer is working over time.

115
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,660
I mean that when you come from France,

116
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,740
I was a 3rd dan, I was in great shape, I used to do a lot of Thai boxing,

117
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,300
I was kind of smart ripped.

118
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,940
I had no problem with Aikido in particular,

119
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,020
I just had an identity problem, that is to say that

120
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,780
Christian's aikido fully satisfied me there was nothing wrong for me.

121
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,040
There was just one thing that bothered me,

122
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
it's the authenticity.

123
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,340
Christian was genuine because he had been to Japan,

124
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,240
and I wanted to find,

125
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,660
in my own aikido,

126
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,700
this authenticity in my practice.

127
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,520
Christian couldn't have brought that to me in spite of all his efforts.

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
It's a question of culture more than a matter of practice.

129
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,360
And so when I arrived,

130
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,980
technically speaking, the aikido they were doing here didn't impress me.

131
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:20,120
As a first impression, I didn't see much difference.

132
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,660
It wasn't necessarily better, they trained, it was easy going,

133
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,580
well, it could be quite rough at the Aikikai at the time, but I was used to that.

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,700
I'm a bit dingy, so it suited me well.

135
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,540
So I didn't see any big differences at first.

136
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I was there for 3 months, and then I stayed.

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,760
I think it's thanks to Kisshomaru Ueshiba, that it changed.

138
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,120
I didn't go to the morning often, and one day, Gerard Sachs told me,

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,060
"Olivier I don't understand, why do not you come in the morning?

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,880
"It's a fundamental class"

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,840
"Especially for you who is always looking for things like that"

142
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,140
"Come train in the morning."

143
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,900
I said, "why not, I'll go".

144
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,820
It was a trigger I think.

145
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,760
I realized, well, behind the facade of the Aikikai's aikido,

146
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,860
there was maybe something else.

147
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,520
Kisshomaru Ueshiba very quickly took me

148
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,000
in confidence perhaps,

149
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,500
and I realized that he had an attention towards me that he didn't have for others.

150
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,000
I liked that.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,040
I thought of it as a sort of recognition,

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,560
for the little, shabby stranger who was there

153
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,000
and who does his aikido the est he can.

154
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,340
When Kisshomaru came with a smile or showed you something a little different, you thought,

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,620
"He shows other things than what he shows others."

156
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,320
There are two worlds.

157
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,140
We call that a dichotomy in French.

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,760
That is to say, a distinction, a cut.

159
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,440
There is what's being shown, and there is what's behind.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,920
That's what made me realize that if there was something behind, it was like a theater.

161
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,760
I love the theater. For me, it's really

162
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,480
I am a little antique in this sense, for me, theater is like life.

163
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,080
In theater you have the audience,

164
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,980
you have the stage with actors, and then you have the backstage.

165
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,620
And then after you have the administration and then you have the firemen, all of that.

166
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,600
And, in fact, people only look at the stage.

167
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,660
The scene it interests me, I met many actors like [Michel] Galabru, etc.

168
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,060
And talking to them is one thing, but seeing them on stage is something else.

169
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,740
So that's what actually happened.

170
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,900
I remember one day, I was working on TV,

171
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,900
I had lunch with Galabru, and then I realized he was not the same as when he was acting,

172
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,460
and that he was telling me things that were different from the image we had of him.

173
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,900
And that's exactly what happened with Kisshomaru Ueshiba.

174
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,800
He told me: "There is the aikido that you do, that you train with, etc., and then there is something else."

175
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,880
And that's where it clicked.

176
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
It took 2 years, maybe 3, I don't know anymore,

177
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,220
and I started to be interested in the backstage of Aikido...

178
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,960
Do you mean behind the scenes in terms of organization or...

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,180
In terms of organization, you can't really get much into the Japanese organization of Aikido.

180
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,200
It's almost impossible, even when speaking Japanese, because of the very Japanese nature of the organization.

181
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,240
It's an organization based on secrecy and on hierarchy

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,060
and hierarchy leads to secrecy,

183
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,860
that is, everything you don't need to know

184
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,480
we don't tell you.

185
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,320
For example, when you go to a Japanese administration to get some information,

186
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,420
you ask a question, and what the respond

187
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,940
is only what you need to know.

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,620
But sometimes, a question in French for example, has several possible solutions.

189
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,420
In Japan no, you are always given one solution,

190
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
the one who accommodates the one behind the counter,

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,300
and if you don't know that there are other solutions, you can't continue,

192
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,360
so you are directed straight away on sidelines,

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,540
because it is not always very direct.

194
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,420
It's what happens in Aikido.

195
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,680
You're told "Do ikkyo like that, do shiho nage like that, do as I do", etc.

196
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,340
So it's a derivation, you're told "Here, you have to go there". There is a sign that says, "That way".

197
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,060
I simplify, but that's it.

198
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,560
So I asked to myself, "Why is there a sign there? But there are other ways there, why is nobody going there? "

199
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Because everyone follows the sign.

200
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,760
Kisshomaru was the first one to say to me, "Here you see, there's the sign, go there,"

201
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,820
"but at the same time, when you have time, well, go see a little bit elsewhere. "

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,300
That's the backstage.

203
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,960
We are quite content with what is practiced,

204
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,400
technically, and philosophical, since I speak of it too [in my book],

205
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,900
at all levels, thought, body, and heart too, relationships with people etc.

206
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,240
but behind all that, there are other worlds.

207
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Several other worlds and these other worlds shape the facade,

208
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,740
but at different levels and at different depths,

209
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,400
and so it's very difficult to sort all of this because

210
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,680
It's a little searching for the needle in the haystack, especially if you have only one question.

211
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,400
So the idea is to try to take the haystack and to work out how it's made,

212
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
what goes with what, and how, and why, etc.

213
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
and then to try to see if there are connections,

214
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
and from these connections, to see if we can find the peasant who made the haystack.

215
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,340
It's a bit like that.

216
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,760
And why he did it like that and not otherwise and why.

217
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,360
So this book that I published recently tells that story.

218
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,440
Trying to clear up aikido and say,

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,200
there is everything that you are being told about this kind of stereotypical story about the life of O Sensei,

220
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,740
Harmony and all that,

221
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,820
Aikido is wonderful, etc.

222
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,160
And there are other untold things,

223
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,340
and that are sometimes better.

224
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,360
But why do not we say them? So also know why we do not say things,

225
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,960
or why we don't do the movements in a certain way.

226
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,220
for example, there are movements in irimi that we don't do anymore.

227
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,440
Recently, I was training with an uchi deshi of the Aikikai,

228
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
and I make him irimi omote.

229
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,820
He looked at me like that and said "we don't do that anymore."

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,640
I said, "Yes, why?"

231
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,640
"It's part of aikido, irimi omote, why don't we do it anymore?"

232
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,760
He said to me," Oh well that's too dangerous. "

233
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
What generation of uchi deshi?

234
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,960
An older generation, one who knew.

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,700
Because I doubt that the new ones can formulate this remark to you.

236
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes, but the new ones don't make this remark to me, besides, they don't come to work with me because they're scared.

237
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,720
Well they're scared, no, I shouldn't say it like that, it's not a physical fear,

238
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,300
They are confronted with the unknown...

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,640
The Japanese have always...

240
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,400
It is a very cautious people.

241
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,940
They don't like the unknown, they like to know where they are going,

242
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,020
how things work, and I am opposite.

243
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,180
You said it to me often, when one works with me, one is not thrown, one falls, it's not the same.

244
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,840
An aikidoka who is used to being thrown, falling, etc., does not like falling

245
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,560
so that's the unknown for those people.

246
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,720
Not for me, because I saw so many things in terms of falls, etc.

247
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,220
Of course there is the formal fall, there is the fall of demonstrations.

248
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,400
It's great too, it's good.

249
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,980
But then there are other things, and so it's the same, it's the backstage.

250
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,240
So after a few years practicing Aikido in Japan, you came across Daito ryu, a little bit by chance.

251
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,180
How did it happen, what made you want to start?

252
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,600
So in fact it's not really a coincidence.

253
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,540
For a very long time, even when I was in France,

254
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,540
The name of Takeda Sokaku was already known to me and interested me

255
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,280
because when one is interested in the life of Aikido, as a virtual character,

256
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,780
we are necessarily interested in the life of O Sensei, that is to say, Ueshiba Morihei,

257
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,420
and so, what was there before?

258
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Who taught him all these techniques?

259
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
There must have been someone, he didn't invent them like that,

260
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,640
it's not possible. Well, it could be possible but,

261
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,740
it's not coherent since there was the war and so on.

262
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,320
It was a subject that had interested me

263
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,720
but little by little, in France, and perhaps elsewhere too,

264
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,620
the very name of Takeda Sokaku disappeared from circulation,

265
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,300
that is to say, we spoke no more of it, like the ki, we don't talk about it, we don;t want to know anymore.

266
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,680
So over generations of practitioners,

267
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,400
people don't know at all, they don't even know the name.

268
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,100
That had been in my head for a very long time

269
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,940
and one day, by chance, that was indeed a coincidence.

270
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,880
My son was doing kendo in the police, and there was a big competition in which he was taking part.

271
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:42,800
And just as we were going out, there was a big sign where it was written:

272
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,720
"Today Daito-ryu seminar with Kobayashi Sensei."

273
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,560
so I went to the receptionist and said, "Hello, I would like to go to the Daito-ryu seminar."

274
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,160
She told me, "It's not possible", so I got angry.

275
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,680
I spoke good Japanese so it's ok, but I was so angry that they didn't let me in.

276
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,040
The director of the sports center came,

277
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,480
he said "Mr foreigner, you have to understand, it's a private seminar."

278
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,860
I said "If it's private why are you putting a sign outside?"

279
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,420
"So what's the point? It's private or it's not private."

280
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,000
"If you put a sign outside, it's for people to know, and if they know, it's so they can come in, so do something."

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,160
So they phoned the Sensei in the dojo,

282
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,620
and he sent an assistant and who told me:

283
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,020
"you can't watch Daito-ryu, it's pointless to watch it,"

284
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,520
"you won't see anything, you won't understand anything,"

285
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,160
"you will have a judgment that will be wrong,"

286
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
"so what we can do is, you give me your coordinates,"

287
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,160
"the next time we have a seminar in Tokyo, you come to practice."

288
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,160
"For free it's not a problem,"

289
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,280
"we offer you the first class if you want and then you can judge by yourself"

290
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,840
So I gave my phone number, thinking that they would never call back,

291
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,720
especially after the scene I had made.

292
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,820
And in fact, they called me back.

293
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,820
It was a month later, there was a new seminar, at another dojo, so I went there, I was was super happy about it.

294
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,260
What happened is that...

295
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,700
They welcomed me with open arms.

296
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,840
It surprised me even because in koryu dojo in Japan, it's rather:

297
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,680
"Do you have a letter of introduction?"

298
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,620
"Yes, I have one"

299
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,000
"Nah but you need two"

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,940
"Oh no, I have another"

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
"Oh yes, but you need three." It's a bit like that.

302
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,820
On the contrary, they welcomed me with open arms, it was Kobayashi [Kiyohiro] Sensei, super nice,

303
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,120
He said, "Do as we do, and see what happens"

304
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,120
And I practiced with Miki Sensei and I did Aikido!

305
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,320
He showed stuff that looked like Aikido so I did Aikido.

306
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,620
So I got them quite tired,

307
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,360
but they told me "But wait, you're moving like a madman"

308
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,820
"It's good but it's not quite like that."

309
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,220
"You'll have to get a little bit into the Daito-ryu way, during your first class at least"

310
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,900
"so that you understand what's going on."

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,940
And there, they started to do the movements on me a little differently.

312
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,840
It was a trigger too, I thought, "There's something going on."

313
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,980
"It's the same types of movements,"

314
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,860
"but as uke I'm not taken the same way, it's not like at the Aikikai"

315
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,200
"I feel something else is happening in my body."

316
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,400
So I became interested. I started like this.

317
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,500
And the more I did it,

318
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,320
the more interesting it became.

319
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,580
Not just because of Daito ryu.

320
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,740
Frankly, I didn't care much about Daito-ryu at first

321
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,060
it was in relation to the Aikido that I was doing it.

322
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,860
Could it bring me something in my Aikido?

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,960
Especially the connection between Takeda Sokaku and Uehsiba Morihei.

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,660
I could finally see physically

325
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,800
a kind of relationship in movements within the practice,

326
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
and I saw at the Aikikai that my aikido was changing.

327
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,120
And that was a real revelation.

328
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,040
How long did it take, for this change to take place?

329
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
It was very fast actually.

330
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,460
You have to understand one thing.

331
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,140
I injured my back pretty badly during boxing,

332
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,320
I really had back problems, I had a double hernia on the back

333
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,480
and it couldn't be operated because it was too delicate.

334
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,200
A famous Tokyo professor told me,

335
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,680
"Listen, you don't want to stop Aikido, do you?"

336
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,960
I said, "No, no, I don't stop, I'll die like Molière, on the mat."

337
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:17,960
And he said, "Then continue but you have to change you Aikido".

338
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,040
I said, "But how do I do it? Tell me"

339
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,740
He said, "But, I don't do aikido, it's you who's doing aikido, it's up to you."

340
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,160
And so from that day I changed. It was just before I started Daito-ryu, actually.

341
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,160
I started to change my aikido, that is,

342
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,340
to better try to feel, within my body, to read my body, as we say in Seitai.

343
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,520
That is to say, to understand what was happening, why I was hurting, the positions etc

344
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,500
What was wrong, why was my elbow hurting all of a sudden

345
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
whereas before it didn't hurt when doing this movement, etc.

346
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,140
This reading actually allowed me, in Daito-ryu shortly after, six months or a year after,

347
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,020
to understand that there were important things going on at the level of the body body level in Daito-ryu.what

348
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,240
With Kobayashi Sensei, it took maybe 6 months, a year but no more, and then I thought,

349
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,680
"Yeah, this is a revolution"

350
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,180
I went from something external, the stage, and I added the backstage,

351
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,720
so here the acting took all of its power, it was bingo.

352
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Even with Christian, I had never felt these things.

353
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,880
It's really a question of sensation, it's not even a question of technique

354
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,980
because I didn't care about techniques, for me it was the same.

355
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,400
Daito-ryu, aikido, I didn't see the difference,

356
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,320
but what I felt was different even when I was doing it.

357
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,020
It took maybe 6 months, a year, and then what happened was

358
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,920
having put Aikido and Daito-ryu in relation, I noticed the differences,

359
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,500
little by little, it took maybe 3 years,

360
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,040
and then I went to Shikoku,

361
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,900
about 3 years later.

362
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,920
I went a bit like in Aikido,

363
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:54,440
from a standard Daito-ryu to more and more specific Daito-ryu.

364
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,420
While still looking for the source.

365
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,240
to look for the source, that's my big thing, it's almost an obsession,

366
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,440
whenever I do something, I look for the source.

367
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,300
What year was that when you met Kobayashi Sensei?

368
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Two thousand...

369
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
We are in  2018,

370
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,880
In 2000, I was in France,

371
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
around 2005

372
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,960
roughly.

373
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,340
So 2 or 3 years later, you went to Shikoku...

374
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,220
And after, 2 or 3 years after, Shikoku yes.

375
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,980
I was introduced to Shikoku by Kobayashi Sensei

376
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,420
because, I asked him, "where does all that it come from?"

377
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,300
Just like that, nicely...

378
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,520
"Where do you train? As a Sensei, where do you train?"

379
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,240
That's a good question, we never ask Sensei "Where do you train?"

380
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,720
The sheer fact that he still trains [is surprising] even though he must already have been 8th dan, kyoju dairi...

381
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,860
He keep training.

382
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,740
Yes, he trains.

383
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,340
There is a lot of Aikido Sensei, in France and in Japan, who don't train anymore.

384
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,040
They don't train anymore.

385
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,080
It's one of the problems of Aikido.

386
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,260
Once someone is Sensei, Hanshi, Kyoshi, who knows what,

387
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
he's settled,

388
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,860
but that's not how it works.

389
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,600
Some are professionals,

390
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,400
but even a professionals in other disciplines still train.

391
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,180
A professional pianist does scales all day.

392
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,180
But they would tell you that they train on their students...

393
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
By teaching, but that's a joke.

394
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,520
Don't think people are fools.

395
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
When you teach, you learn things too

396
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,380
for sure, and another way to do Aikido, that's obvious.

397
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,540
But, like when you teach piano, like when you teach surfing, etc.

398
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,340
But it's not a training,

399
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,020
there is no questioning, that's the problem.

400
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,620
The problem is questioning.

401
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,220
A surfer for example, who is professional,

402
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,360
he's doing the big competitions, etc.

403
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,060
but he trains he goes to Biarritz, to Portugal, etc.

404
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,120
Why ? Because he knows very well that he has to constantly question himself.

405
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,900
In Aikido, there is no questioning, it's won in advance

406
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,840
I am Sensei so you obey... you cooperate...

407
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,680
And there's that kind of aura that makes the Sensei's uke... he's already won.

408
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,960
So it's easy.

409
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,000
it's a rigged game

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,560
don't mix authenticity with that sort of role play.

411
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,320
Yesterday, I trained with one of the young Sensei of the Aikikai.

412
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,960
I don't give him anything as a uke. I don't do it and he is happy!

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
He is happy !

414
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,300
Because

415
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,560
he tells me,

416
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,260
"At least, with you I feel I'm doing something, it's not as usual."

417
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,300
If I can sweep his leg and tip him over, I'll do it.

418
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,700
It's up to him to fend for himself.

419
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,740
You put the word on it, he's a young Sensei of the Aikikai.

420
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,340
Yes, but he is heavier than me!

421
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,380
Yes I understand, but in the hierarchy,

422
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,580
he arrived after you.

423
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,160
He arrived after me but hey, there are different hierarchies in Japan.

424
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,560
I understand, but I doubt if anyone who was there before you would have reacted so positively.

425
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,220
I did it with...

426
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,380
You need the means to do it. That is to say, you can't do whatever you like.

427
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,840
We're not in MMA, or anything

428
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,340
but what I mean is that the role of uke must be

429
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
not only a participant.

430
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,940
For me at least.

431
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,900
In France we say... well, it comes from Japan, actually...

432
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,520
we say that uke must be half of the movement.

433
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,940
I'm sorry but if uke is not an attacker,

434
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,900
we might as well play tennis.

435
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,700
We must also define what is meant by "half", that is to say, if we speak ...

436
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,860
He does half of the movement.

437
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,320
If we talk about katageiko,

438
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,380
uke does his job of attacking,

439
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,620
an attack as it should e done, it is not half of the movement in a kind of "submission" so that the movement works...

440
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes, but that's what it's coming to.

441
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,420
Until the 1st dan, or even until the 4th dan if you want,

442
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,080
perhaps, that is, there is a connivance that must be in place to improve the movements, etc.

443
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,140
To also find one's strength, power, coordination, etc.

444
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,800
So it's a gymnastic work but gymnastic work does not have to go on forever.

445
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,500
Someone who has 10 years of Aikido

446
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,260
if he continues that way until the end of his life,

447
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,120
why is he continuing?

448
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,720
It's a personal pleasure,

449
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,160
he became Sensei, or he became this, he became that.

450
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,420
Me if there if someone who challenges me, even a beginner, I am super happy

451
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,460
because at least there I see if my movement corresponds to something coherent not.

452
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,080
If I'm never challenged,

453
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,360
or someone else, it's not just me, me, me, I do not care,

454
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,100
but when I practice, I need that the partner...

455
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,100
When I work with you, you're heavy, you move well, you're dangerous,

456
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,800
that's interesting.

457
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,000
That is to say that I actually do it, when I work with you,

458
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,480
can I do the aikido that I speak of?

459
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,100
That is the problem :

460
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,380
to say what we do and do what we say.

461
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
If we can do both,

462
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,220
say what we do and do what we say, then yes, okay.

463
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,600
But to be able to do that, the partner has to be there

464
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,420
and be consistent.

465
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,100
even if he is lighter, even if he is more flexible or if...

466
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,160
Consistent means that he is present,

467
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,600
that there is a really continual presence until the end of the movement, until he is immobilized.

468
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,120
He's here, he's not neutral or passive

469
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,520
He's not passive.

470
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,320
Or submissive...

471
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,380
He is not submissive, it is not an act of enslavement, aikido, not at all.

472
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,360
We just accept the context of the attack, say, katageiko, but...

473
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,820
We say OK, it's shomen uchi, but for example yesterday, with this young Sensei

474
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,740
I was working on yokomen uchi,

475
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,560
so during the whole class, I tried to touch him.

476
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,220
Not touch like that, to have a yokomen, and I got there once.

477
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,480
Once it's good!

478
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,320
I always say, in a class, if you make one great movement,

479
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,680
then you have won the day there, it's great!

480
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,900
Even an attack...

481
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,820
Yes, for example an attack.

482
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,080
Even a phase of movement, there, really you have

483
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,620
touched the heart of aiki.

484
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Then okay.

485
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,480
Yes, yes, yes.

486
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,860
It can be a bit complicated here, you talked about Kobayashi Sensei, you talked about Shikoku.

487
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,420
Kobayashi Sensei is one of the founding members of the Takumakai.

488
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,600
Could you come back briefly to the Takumakai,

489
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,500
and why did you chose the Takumakai?

490
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,940
Was it just the occasion that made you come across the Takumakai,

491
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,440
and you continue with them, or did you

492
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,320
chose the Takumakai for particular reasons,

493
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,500
compared for example what would people of a lineage and Hokkaido or...

494
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,920
You can say that...

495
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,140
at the beginning that it was a coincidence since I came across this seminar,

496
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
it was in Tamachi, Tokyo

497
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,920
Where I was actually invited,

498
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,820
in anticipation but hey, I asked

499
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,180
to be able to participate so they invited me to do it.

500
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,020
That was pure chance, it could have been Roppokai, it could have been Kondo Sensei,

501
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,400
it could have been many other people.

502
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,500
Because there are a lot of [Daito-ryu] schools...

503
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,420
What you need to know is that Takumakai is very close to Aikido

504
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,900
so they have an approach of Daito-ryu that is more open.

505
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,420
Not a lot but, but more open than others

506
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
branches that are quite closed or

507
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,360
more traditional in a way.

508
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,400
So it's a coincidence and at the same time, it was perhaps easier to access.

509
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,500
It happened like that.

510
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,920
And then, when I got interested in the Takumakai,

511
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,800
at first I did not even know what it was.

512
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,140
I had heard about it but not much.

513
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,420
I said "well, there is a relationship with Aikido", and that interested me more

514
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,940
because among others, Kobayashi Sensei

515
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,900
had started more or less by aikido, actually.

516
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,940
So he always did his Daito-ryu compared to Aikido,

517
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,560
and even in what he teaches now,

518
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,820
we feel it very well.

519
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,140
- I have seen other daito ryu elsewhere -

520
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,480
There is an influence of Aikido in his technique.

521
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,540
When one says "an influence of aikido", one must be very clear:

522
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,520
it is an influence of Ueshiba.

523
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
From the Daito-ryu of Ueshiba Sensei.

524
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,300
Because he [Kobayashii] knew Ueshiba didn't he?

525
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,800
Exactly, he knew Ueshiba Sensei.

526
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
It's necessary to open a short parenthesis.

527
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,540
Ueshiba Sensei started with Daito-ryu

528
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,040
and he taught Daito-ryu,

529
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,860
even though he didn't have a teaching license from Takeda Sokaku.

530
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,720
He had it in a way...

531
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,140
but not of a higher level,

532
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,620
where he could have been independent.

533
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,980
He was Takeda's representative.

534
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,460
Yes, he was a representative, under guardianship let's say.

535
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,100
But in reality, when he taught,

536
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,160
he didn't do it under guardianship, but a little autonomously.

537
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,220
That's why there was a break with Takeda Sokaku, because he would have said

538
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,620
"But wait, you do not have the authorization to do that".

539
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,380
I simplify, it's a bit more complicated, but

540
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,340
if you want to know, read my book.

541
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,900
There is everything in it, it's good.

542
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,540
It's summarized so it's easy to read.

543
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,780
But basically that's what happened and so

544
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,040
Ueshiba Morihei is thought to have taught Aikido all his life,

545
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,580
which, in my opinion, is a mistake.

546
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,260
It's partly erroneuous let's say.

547
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,300
Why ?

548
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,340
Because at the beginning,

549
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,120
until 1942 he taught Daito-ryu.

550
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,600
So if you have doubts, try to get this...

551
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,380
it's not easy to have,

552
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,420
Good luck!

553
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,960
They are extremely rare copies,

554
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,100
but they have all the old Daito-ryu techniques that were done before the war.

555
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,300
Basically that's it.

556
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,240
There are several volumes, but this is just one.

557
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,160
You have here an innumerable number of techniques.

558
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,840
I show it to you to show that there are still proofs,

559
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
and that's not words in the air.

560
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,520
There is evidence, and if we can read the evidence,

561
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,860
you have to know how to read the proofs too, because if you look, like that ... yes good

562
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,420
and so Ueshiba taught Daito-ryu.

563
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,940
What happened is that in 1942,

564
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,340
because of the war, because of events with Takeda Sokaku etc.

565
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,460
there was a kind of break that was decided, that is to say that

566
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:02,120
the group that worked with Ueshiba decided to register the word "Aikido"

567
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,440
to the Japanese Ministry of Education,

568
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,460
so it was a bit like a patent in fact, that's it.

569
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,540
And so the word "aikido" was born in 1942 to the eye of the Japanese Ministry of Education.

570
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,840
However, Ueshiba Sensei did not

571
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,000
change his teaching, not at all, he just changed the way he taught.

572
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,840
This is what people don't understand.

573
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,440
That is to say, he continued to do his movements,

574
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,340
himself of course, with his own progression,

575
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,120
therefore his own progression which also concerned philosophy,

576
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,360
the way to look at the movements, etc.

577
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,420
and he

578
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,320
simplified

579
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,300
the curriculum of these techniques.

580
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,480
He synthesized all that, in his own way

581
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,260
There was Iwama, etc. that's a long story,

582
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,620
you refer to book, there is everything in it.

583
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:55,400
And it's at that time that students who started after 1942

584
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,800
saw the Aikido of O Sensei,

585
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,120
but O Sensei no longer taught the Daito-ryu that he was nonetheless still doing,

586
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,740
so the students could not

587
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,560
capture the techniques

588
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,500
of Daito-ryu as they should have been done.

589
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,700
They could see, but they couldn't do it, so they invented ways to get there.

590
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,380
Basically that's what happened.

591
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,020
And Kobayashi Sensei, from Takumakai,

592
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,020
began Aikido in these circumstances.

593
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,640
However, unlike others, he was also doing Daito-ryu.

594
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,840
He was doing both at the same time so he was able to extract

595
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,380
from Morihei Ueshiba's Aikido all that was done in Daito-ryu and in Aikido

596
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,160
because someone who does Daito-ryu can understand what is done in Aikido,

597
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,540
whereas someone who does Aikido can't understand what's done in Daito-ryu,

598
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,740
It's one way. That's what's great. Well, great, depends for who...

599
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,160
It's pretty interesting.

600
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,160
So Kobayashi Sensei was in the right place to record both versions of Aiki.

601
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,520
For me in fact there isn't "Aikido" and "Aiki-jujutsu", there is "Aiki".

602
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,240
Then it should be noted that the teacher of Kobayashi Sensei in Daito-ryu had himself learned from Ueshiba.

603
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,000
Absolutely. Hisa Sensei,

604
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,980
- It was for him that the Takumakai was founded -

605
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,740
was initially a student of Morihei Ueshiba

606
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,940
who was then co-opted by Takeda Sokaku.

607
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,380
And so Takeda Sokaku gave him the Menkyo Kaiden at the end

608
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,460
to show that, hey, he had

609
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,240
acquired the entire technical repertoire,

610
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,220
perhaps not the repertoire, but at least the technical knowledge,

611
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,500
- It's not the same -

612
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,860
of Daito-ryu.

613
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,500
But Hisa Takuma was originally a student of O Sensei,

614
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,960
but since O Sensei also taught Daito-ryu, there isn't a big difference,

615
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,940
it's just a difference, we're going to say, of personality.
