00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
you've got their arm you've got their
 

179
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,509
you've got their arm you've got their
wrist

180
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
wrist
 

181
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,589
wrist
you hit them in the ribs and you drive

182
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
you hit them in the ribs and you drive
 

183
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,270
you hit them in the ribs and you drive
it this way but don't add

184
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
it this way but don't add
 

185
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,470
it this way but don't add
to this

186
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
to this
 

187
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,390
to this
this motion so

188
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
this motion so
 

189
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,270
this motion so
the power is really in hitting them in

190
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
the power is really in hitting them in
 

191
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,470
the power is really in hitting them in
the ribs

192
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
the ribs
 

193
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,750
the ribs
with the knee

194
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
with the knee
 

195
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,990
with the knee
controlling of the elbow and then you

196
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
controlling of the elbow and then you
 

197
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,350
controlling of the elbow and then you
press it down as a whole thing

198
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360

 

199
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,390

and you place the arm down flat in front

200
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
and you place the arm down flat in front
 

201
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,270
and you place the arm down flat in front
of you a t-angle as the pictures show

202
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
of you a t-angle as the pictures show
 

203
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,830
of you a t-angle as the pictures show
you it

204
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840

 

205
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,949

now

206
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
now
 

207
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,830
now
to do

208
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
to do
 

209
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,830
to do
to move on to nick here the only

210
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
to move on to nick here the only
 

211
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,149
to move on to nick here the only
difference is all of this is the same

212
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
difference is all of this is the same
 

213
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,390
difference is all of this is the same
but nicki oh now you apply this inwardly

214
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
but nicki oh now you apply this inwardly
 

215
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,710
but nicki oh now you apply this inwardly
and instead of

216
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
and instead of
 

217
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,510
and instead of
at this end this angle

218
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
at this end this angle
 

219
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,350
at this end this angle
this angle with their body and their arm

220
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
this angle with their body and their arm
 

221
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,830
this angle with their body and their arm
you bring it up and you apply it so it

222
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
you bring it up and you apply it so it
 

223
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,790
you bring it up and you apply it so it
becomes more downwards

224
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
becomes more downwards
 

225
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,270
becomes more downwards
and your aim is

226
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
and your aim is
 

227
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,909
and your aim is
in both of them to pin their shoulder

228
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
in both of them to pin their shoulder
 

229
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,230
in both of them to pin their shoulder
the shoulder you're trying to pin their

230
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
the shoulder you're trying to pin their
 

231
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,790
the shoulder you're trying to pin their
shoulders down on the ground to end it

232
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
shoulders down on the ground to end it
 

233
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,950
shoulders down on the ground to end it
quickly rather than go for like a long

234
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
quickly rather than go for like a long
 

235
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,950
quickly rather than go for like a long
walk

236
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
walk
 

237
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,830
walk
but the nikki oh you adjust this just a

238
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
but the nikki oh you adjust this just a
 

239
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,430
but the nikki oh you adjust this just a
little more

240
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
little more
 

241
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,350
little more
by this pressure

242
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
by this pressure
 

243
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,590
by this pressure
the pain will stop them

244
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
the pain will stop them
 

245
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,189
the pain will stop them
walking

246
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
walking
 

247
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,550
walking
and it will drive it more

248
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
and it will drive it more
 

249
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,710
and it will drive it more
so okay so body science

250
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
so okay so body science
 

251
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,830
so okay so body science
ikea

252
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

253
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,070

nicu then you go down on your knees or

254
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
nicu then you go down on your knees or
 

255
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,110
nicu then you go down on your knees or
standing and you can do the pin

256
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120

 

257
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,870

okay so it's a very subtle difference

258
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
okay so it's a very subtle difference
 

259
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,790
okay so it's a very subtle difference
and you need to understand the

260
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
and you need to understand the
 

261
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,629
and you need to understand the
sensitivity as well as the direction

262
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
sensitivity as well as the direction
 

263
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,110
sensitivity as well as the direction
and understanding this what would give

264
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
and understanding this what would give
 

265
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,990
and understanding this what would give
you a professionalism and much more

266
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
you a professionalism and much more
 

267
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,230
you a professionalism and much more
control of your partner

268
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240

 

269
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,469

i hope you test it out and each film

270
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
i hope you test it out and each film
 

271
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,350
i hope you test it out and each film
that is given to you

272
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
that is given to you
 

273
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,510
that is given to you
hasn't just been plucked out of the air

274
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
hasn't just been plucked out of the air
 

275
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,150
hasn't just been plucked out of the air
it's taken me many years of study to get

276
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
it's taken me many years of study to get
 

277
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,909
it's taken me many years of study to get
to this stage

278
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
to this stage
 

279
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,550
to this stage
so please don't just think oh when's the

280
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
so please don't just think oh when's the
 

281
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,629
so please don't just think oh when's the
next film coming when's the next film

282
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
next film coming when's the next film
 

283
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,749
next film coming when's the next film
coming

284
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
coming
 

285
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,790
coming
you need to study and study and the

286
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
you need to study and study and the
 

287
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,309
you need to study and study and the
films that are already on the system

288
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
films that are already on the system
 

289
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,390
films that are already on the system
may take your lifetime to understand

290
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
may take your lifetime to understand
 

291
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,110
may take your lifetime to understand
so even if you don't understand them now

292
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
so even if you don't understand them now
 

293
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,110
so even if you don't understand them now
watch them

294
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
watch them
 

295
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,870
watch them
over and over

296
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
over and over
 

297
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,029
over and over
it's not worth my advice it's your

298
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
it's not worth my advice it's your
 

299
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,469
it's not worth my advice it's your
choice

300
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
choice
 

301
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,189
choice
try to understand what's going on in my

302
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
try to understand what's going on in my
 

303
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,070
try to understand what's going on in my
head and see if you can capture that

304
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
head and see if you can capture that
 

305
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,710
head and see if you can capture that
so it's not just about angles

306
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
so it's not just about angles
 

307
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,189
so it's not just about angles
it's about

308
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
it's about
 

309
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,189
it's about
sensitivity like i said the whole

310
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
sensitivity like i said the whole
 

311
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,670
sensitivity like i said the whole
style like you know has a lot of

312
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,680
style like you know has a lot of
 

313
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,870
style like you know has a lot of
sensitivity in it

314
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
sensitivity in it
 

315
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,029
sensitivity in it
they're feeling they're searching

316
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039

 

317
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,350

we do search and feel but not in the

318
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
we do search and feel but not in the
 

319
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,029
we do search and feel but not in the
same way it can look much more

320
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
same way it can look much more
 

321
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,990
same way it can look much more
like control

322
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
like control
 

323
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,110
like control
perhaps we want to become more precise

324
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
perhaps we want to become more precise
 

325
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,350
perhaps we want to become more precise
in our work you know

326
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
in our work you know
 

327
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,589
in our work you know
but it's up to you

328
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
but it's up to you
 

329
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,749
but it's up to you
okay it's very difficult and you'll need

330
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
okay it's very difficult and you'll need
 

331
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,430
okay it's very difficult and you'll need
to see the films with the book

332
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
to see the films with the book
 

333
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,749
to see the films with the book
to understand the fullness of the

334
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
to understand the fullness of the
 

335
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,870
to understand the fullness of the
technique

336
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
technique
 

337
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,950
technique
good luck and

338
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
good luck and
 

339
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080
good luck and
we'll talk again soon
