time they didn't do kokun nag at the end

190
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
time they didn't do kokun nag at the end
 

191
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,629
time they didn't do kokun nag at the end
they did teni Naga at then okay but if

192
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:41,639
they did teni Naga at then okay but if
 

193
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,950
they did teni Naga at then okay but if
you pay attention to coku Naga it's just

194
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
you pay attention to coku Naga it's just
 

195
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,350
you pay attention to coku Naga it's just
teni n when you understand it this way

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,360
teni n when you understand it this way
 

197
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,710
teni n when you understand it this way
it's just

00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
moved right from around the neck to in
 

201
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,230
moved right from around the neck to in
front of the neck okay but if you pay

202
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
front of the neck okay but if you pay
 

203
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,830
front of the neck okay but if you pay
attention every single technique is

204
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
attention every single technique is
 

205
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,029
attention every single technique is
actually doing doing this so suos which

206
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,039
actually doing doing this so suos which
 

207
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,670
actually doing doing this so suos which
we did last week is doing the same thing

208
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
we did last week is doing the same thing
 

209
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,189
we did last week is doing the same thing
but it's on the wrist and elbow as

210
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:08,199
but it's on the wrist and elbow as
 

211
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,870
but it's on the wrist and elbow as
opposed to the neck and wrist

212
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
opposed to the neck and wrist
 

213
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,790
opposed to the neck and wrist
okay so now you're going to do both we

214
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
okay so now you're going to do both we
 

215
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,060
okay so now you're going to do both we
won't do any movement okay I do

216
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,070
won't do any movement okay I do

the guys coming forward you you can't do

242
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,800
the guys coming forward you you can't do
 

243
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,350
the guys coming forward you you can't do
back break Falls you can't do a

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
technique that's going to throw someone
 

247
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,950
technique that's going to throw someone
backwards that is already going

248
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
backwards that is already going
 

249
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,950
backwards that is already going
backwards um meaning if I'm here like

250
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
backwards um meaning if I'm here like
 

251
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,350
backwards um meaning if I'm here like
this you uh and you just come forward to

252
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
this you uh and you just come forward to
 

253
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,390
this you uh and you just come forward to
do the technique come forward to do the

254
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
do the technique come forward to do the
 

255
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,909
do the technique come forward to do the
technique he comes forward to do the I

256
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
technique he comes forward to do the I
 

257
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,869
technique he comes forward to do the I
can just

258
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:31,879
can just
 

259
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,670
can just
move my being locked into the inertial

260
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
move my being locked into the inertial
 

261
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,469
move my being locked into the inertial
energy of the forward progress is what

262
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
energy of the forward progress is what
 

263
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,070
energy of the forward progress is what
provides angles of cancellation that

264
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,080
provides angles of cancellation that
 

265
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,550
provides angles of cancellation that
won't let me counter the throw okay so

266
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
won't let me counter the throw okay so
 

267
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,830
won't let me counter the throw okay so
whenever you're throwing someone

268
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
whenever you're throwing someone
 

269
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,029
whenever you're throwing someone
backwards it has to be going forward

270
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
backwards it has to be going forward
 

271
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,029
backwards it has to be going forward
okay so I brought him forward he's going

272
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:54,039

 

273
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,510

forward now I got to figure out to as I

274
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
forward now I got to figure out to as I
 

275
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,029
forward now I got to figure out to as I
after I generated his forward energy

276
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,039
after I generated his forward energy
 

277
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,110
after I generated his forward energy
now I got to figure out how to turn it

278
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
now I got to figure out how to turn it
 

279
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,629
now I got to figure out how to turn it
so that that forward energy is now going

280
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:05,639
so that that forward energy is now going
 

281
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,869
so that that forward energy is now going
backwards to provide the yin energy or

282
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
backwards to provide the yin energy or
 

283
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,950
backwards to provide the yin energy or
the yin opening for me to enter like the

284
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:11,960
the yin opening for me to enter like the
 

285
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,230
the yin opening for me to enter like the
technique requires and that is going to

286
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
technique requires and that is going to
 

287
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,589
technique requires and that is going to
be

288
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
be
 

289
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,110
be
done

290
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
done
 

291
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,469
done
in this fashion so if you watch the

292
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
in this fashion so if you watch the
 

293
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,710
in this fashion so if you watch the
technique I am bringing him into this

294
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
technique I am bringing him into this
 

295
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,149
technique I am bringing him into this
adhesion point and transition it to this

296
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159
adhesion point and transition it to this
 

297
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,990
adhesion point and transition it to this
adhesion point so I going from here and

298
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
adhesion point so I going from here and
 

299
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,509
adhesion point so I going from here and
now I don't care about his grip I'm here

300
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
now I don't care about his grip I'm here
 

301
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,469
now I don't care about his grip I'm here
on his face okay anywhere on his head

302
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
on his face okay anywhere on his head
 

303
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,190
on his face okay anywhere on his head
face area was my sole

304
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,200
face area was my sole
 

305
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,590
face area was my sole
intention when I brought him forward and

306
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
intention when I brought him forward and
 

307
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,030
intention when I brought him forward and
you will use your footwork to make that

308
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040

 

309
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,310

happen that's what I

310
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,320

 

311
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,430

want pass it from this adhesion point to

312
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
want pass it from this adhesion point to
 

313
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,030
want pass it from this adhesion point to
this adhesion point I want you to be

314
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,040
this adhesion point I want you to be
 

315
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:13,870
this adhesion point I want you to be
conscious of it

316
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:13,880

 

317
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,110

now I not knocking

318
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
now I not knocking
 

319
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,670
now I not knocking
him I'm just touching it there so when

320
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:20,680
him I'm just touching it there so when
 

321
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,310
him I'm just touching it there so when
he hits that new adhesion point I have

322
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,320
he hits that new adhesion point I have
 

323
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,949
he hits that new adhesion point I have
to match his y value so I get the

324
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
to match his y value so I get the
 

325
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,829
to match his y value so I get the
adhesion knocking him is is not going to

326
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
adhesion knocking him is is not going to
 

327
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,269
adhesion knocking him is is not going to
do

328
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279

 

329
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,590

it so our little micr drill is get on

330
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
it so our little micr drill is get on
 

331
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,870
it so our little micr drill is get on
that adhesion

332
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880

 

333
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,710

Point okay let's

334
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:47,720
Point okay let's
 

335
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,310
Point okay let's
go so what you did with the initial hand

336
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,320
go so what you did with the initial hand
 

337
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,470
go so what you did with the initial hand
workk to bring him forward is a yes it

338
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,480
workk to bring him forward is a yes it
 

339
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,110
workk to bring him forward is a yes it
is a Yin

340
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120
is a Yin
 

341
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,190
is a Yin

343
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,389

but it's not me getting out of the way

344
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
but it's not me getting out of the way
 

345
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,670
but it's not me getting out of the way
is it I have an Ike adhesion at the

346
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:10,680

 

347
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,910

grip and a

348
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:14,920

 

349
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,829

seizure at the tanden that's what moves

350
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
seizure at the tanden that's what moves
 

351
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,470
seizure at the tanden that's what moves
him forward

352
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,480
him forward
 

353
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,829
him forward
okay and now what I do at the grip so

354
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:22,839
okay and now what I do at the grip so
 

355
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,430
okay and now what I do at the grip so
this is at this is at the

356
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
this is at this is at the
 

357
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,430
this is at this is at the
grip and this is at at the tanden the

358
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,440
grip and this is at at the tanden the
 

359
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,470
grip and this is at at the tanden the
lower

360
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
lower
 

361
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,670
lower
tanden and then what I ended up

362
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
tanden and then what I ended up
 

363
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,110
tanden and then what I ended up
doing was I took this and went not at

364
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,120
doing was I took this and went not at
 

365
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,949
doing was I took this and went not at
the grip but at the middle portion of

366
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
the grip but at the middle portion of
 

367
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,430
the grip but at the middle portion of
the heaven arm okay so we're going to do

368
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
the heaven arm okay so we're going to do
 

369
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,190
the heaven arm okay so we're going to do
middle of the heaven

370
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,200

 

371
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,710

arm that's where I move my adhesion

372
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:57,720
arm that's where I move my adhesion
 

373
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,949
arm that's where I move my adhesion
to and and I keep the

374
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:01,959
to and and I keep the
 

375
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,790
to and and I keep the
seizure at the lower T end that's where

376
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:05,800
seizure at the lower T end that's where
 

377
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,710
seizure at the lower T end that's where
I am in this technique so far

378
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:09,720
I am in this technique so far
 

379
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,150
I am in this technique so far
okay now what I'm going to do is another

380
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,160
okay now what I'm going to do is another
 

381
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,150
okay now what I'm going to do is another
Yin yield at this

382
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,160
Yin yield at this
 

383
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,990
Yin yield at this
point it is going to be still an

384
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
point it is going to be still an
 

385
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,629
point it is going to be still an
adhesion and a

386
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:24,639

 

387
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,269

seizure I'm not just getting out of the

388
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
seizure I'm not just getting out of the
 

389
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,509
seizure I'm not just getting out of the
way I am moving this person's

390
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:32,519

 

391
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,509

midsection okay I'm going to do this at

392
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
midsection okay I'm going to do this at
 

393
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,190
midsection okay I'm going to do this at
the middle Heaven

394
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
the middle Heaven
 

395
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,710
the middle Heaven
arm and what I'm doing here is just two

396
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
arm and what I'm doing here is just two
 

397
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,350
arm and what I'm doing here is just two
dimensionally to keep it simple is

398
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
dimensionally to keep it simple is
 

399
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,509
dimensionally to keep it simple is
energy was going

400
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
energy was going
 

401
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,389

energy forward
 

411
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,629
energy forward
you guys got

412
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:01,639
you guys got
 

413
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,389
you guys got
it okay what I am not going to

414
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
it okay what I am not going to
 

415
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,870
it okay what I am not going to
do is a Yong Yong Clash what a Yong Yong

416
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,880
do is a Yong Yong Clash what a Yong Yong
 

417
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,110
do is a Yong Yong Clash what a Yong Yong
Clash does is Energy's going

418
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120

 

419
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,550

forward and then I try to shove it

420
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
forward and then I try to shove it
 

421
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,750
forward and then I try to shove it
backwards and make it go this way I'm

422
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
backwards and make it go this way I'm
 

423
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,069
backwards and make it go this way I'm
not going to do that so let this turn

424
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
not going to do that so let this turn
 

425
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,069
not going to do that so let this turn
right here is your Yin

426

00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:11,639
rotate it's an extension of Yin Yong
 

511
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,870
rotate it's an extension of Yin Yong
Theory so if you have Yin and yangong

512
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
Theory so if you have Yin and yangong
 

513
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,670
Theory so if you have Yin and yangong
and you you give one the horizontal axis

514
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
and you you give one the horizontal axis
 

515
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,389
and you you give one the horizontal axis
and one the vertical axis they are at

516
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
and one the vertical axis they are at
 

517
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,430
and one the vertical axis they are at
their sharpest distinction they are at

518
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,440
their sharpest distinction they are at
 

519
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,389
their sharpest distinction they are at
their fullest yinin Yong okay and you go

520
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
their fullest yinin Yong okay and you go
 

521
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,829
their fullest yinin Yong okay and you go
back to yinong Theory and and uh prior

522
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:30,839
back to yinong Theory and and uh prior
 

523
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,949

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:37,560
external component to it but you're
 

571
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,110
external component to it but you're

trying to do it internally with your
 

573
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,749
trying to do it internally with your

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,509
tonden when you're able to do that let's
make a jump but I wouldn't consider this

576
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:44,519
make a jump but I wouldn't consider this

101 when you're able to do that within
 

581
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,150
101 when you're able to do that within
your own tonden you will be able to do

582
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
your own tonden you will be able to do
 

583
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,870
your own tonden you will be able to do
it into ukis tanden and when you're able

584
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
it into ukis tanden and when you're able
 

585
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,470
it into ukis tanden and when you're able
to do it within your tanden and ukas

586
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480
to do it within your tanden and ukas
 

587
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,230
to do it within your tanden and ukas
tanden you will reach an energetic value

588
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,240
tanden you will reach an energetic value
 

589
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,629
tanden you will reach an energetic value
for that will manifest at the level of

590
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:03,639
for that will manifest at the level of
 

591
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,669
for that will manifest at the level of
the heart mind at level of shin the

592
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
the heart mind at level of shin the
 

593
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,710
the heart mind at level of shin the
level of cocol okay and that's a

594
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
level of cocol okay and that's a
 

595
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,829
level of cocol okay and that's a
Reconciliation between the ego

596
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:10,839

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,079
tripartite mind and the god mind it puts
 

599
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,189
tripartite mind and the god mind it puts
you in that ecstatic state so every time

600
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:16,199
you in that ecstatic state so every time
 

601
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,110
you in that ecstatic state so every time
you're doing kihon waza and you do this

602
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,120
you're doing kihon waza and you do this
 

603
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,029
you're doing kihon waza and you do this
you're getting in that ecstatic State

604
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,039
you're getting in that ecstatic State
 

605
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,309
you're getting in that ecstatic State
you returning to that pre Yin and

606
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,319
you returning to that pre Yin and
 

607
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,029
you returning to that pre Yin and
yangong that pre dichotomy okay okay

608
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
yangong that pre dichotomy okay okay
 

609
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,510
yangong that pre dichotomy okay okay
that is

610
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,520
that is
 

611
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,430
that is
misogi so if we look here at this

612
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440

 

613
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,990

technique 's energy is going this

614
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000

 

615
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,310

way okay and I am going to make it go

616
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,320
way okay and I am going to make it go
 

617
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,789
way okay and I am going to make it go
the other way and of course here we're

618
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:49,799
the other way and of course here we're
 

619
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,950
the other way and of course here we're
looking just two-dimensionally as you

620
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
looking just two-dimensionally as you
 

621
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,230
looking just two-dimensionally as you
would feel is zuk get there's some down

622
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
would feel is zuk get there's some down
 

623
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,590
would feel is zuk get there's some down
and there's some lift as well in all of

624
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:56,600
and there's some lift as well in all of
 

625
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,990
and there's some lift as well in all of
these patterns okay and that's why it's

626
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,000
these patterns okay and that's why it's
 

627
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,510
these patterns okay and that's why it's
spiral rotating it's not just turning on

628
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
spiral rotating it's not just turning on
 

629
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,710
spiral rotating it's not just turning on
a flat surface okay eventually I'm going

630
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
a flat surface okay eventually I'm going
 

631
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,190
a flat surface okay eventually I'm going
to make UK go this way right UK energy

632
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,200
to make UK go this way right UK energy
 

633
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,310
to make UK go this way right UK energy

these cross pattern here got it you have

642
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:21,640
these cross pattern here got it you have
 

643
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,510
these cross pattern here got it you have
to do this at the

644
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:26,520

 

645
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,190

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,310
end and then this this is really my
upper body on my lower body it's going

648
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
upper body on my lower body it's going
 

649
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,510
upper body on my lower body it's going
to go this way and

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,280
turn okay now if you look closely you
 

653
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,190
turn okay now if you look closely you
got like one Loop here and another loop

654
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,200
got like one Loop here and another loop
 

655
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,830
got like one Loop here and another loop
here I'm we pull those two Loops out and

656
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
here I'm we pull those two Loops out and
 

657
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,909
here I'm we pull those two Loops out and
you kind of have your little Infinity

658
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
you kind of have your little Infinity
 

659
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,630
you kind of have your little Infinity
thing doing that's what you're trying to

okay and then uh when you're if if you
 

665
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,029
okay and then uh when you're if if you
extend this one around this way you have

666
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
extend this one around this way you have
 

667
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,830
extend this one around this way you have
it again over here do you see it so you

668
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
it again over here do you see it so you
 

669
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,590
it again over here do you see it so you

have one horizontal one and
 

671
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,669
have one horizontal one and
one vertical one your spiral rotating

to make their legs their lower part of

680
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:26,840
to make their legs their lower part of
 

681
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,909
to make their legs their lower part of
their body m match perfectly the upper

682
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
their body m match perfectly the upper
 

683
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,630
their body m match perfectly the upper
part of the body and that messes you up

715
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,549

and this is where I think you're running

716
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
and this is where I think you're running
 

717
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,909
and this is where I think you're running
into problems and Margaret you're

718
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
into problems and Margaret you're
 

719
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,430
into problems and Margaret you're
running into problems when you are

running into problems when you are
 

721
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,830
running into problems when you are
imagining this technique you're

722
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:40,840
imagining this technique you're
 

723
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,470
imagining this technique you're
imagining a guy going here and then he

724
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:43,480
imagining a guy going here and then he
 

725
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,870
imagining a guy going here and then he
bends over and then he he falls

726
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:49,880

 

727
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,390

backward again he's coming forward you

728
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,400
backward again he's coming forward you
 

729
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,149
backward again he's coming forward you
bend him at his waist and he comes

730
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
bend him at his waist and he comes
 

731
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,390
bend him at his waist and he comes
backwards okay

732
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,400
backwards okay
 

733
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,430
backwards okay
this bending at his

734
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
this bending at his
 

735
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,590
this bending at his
waist that

736
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
waist that
 

737
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,909
waist that
part that is not good that's wrong if I

738
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
part that is not good that's wrong if I
 

739
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,950
part that is not good that's wrong if I
seized his tongue de he can't bend at

740
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
seized his tongue de he can't bend at
 

741
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,630
seized his tongue de he can't bend at
his waist do he can't he gets rigid okay

742
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:15,640
his waist do he can't he gets rigid okay
 

743
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,470
his waist do he can't he gets rigid okay
so now what I would like for you to do

so now what I would like for you to do
 

745
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,909
so now what I would like for you to do
is watch his body in the throw to see if

746
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
is watch his body in the throw to see if
 

747
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,789
is watch his body in the throw to see if
he hinges at his weight got it okay you

748
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
he hinges at his weight got it okay you
 

749
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:34,669
he hinges at his weight got it okay you
can watch for him

750
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:34,679

 

751
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,029

what did you say no I was to to contrast

752
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:38,039
what did you say no I was to to contrast
 

753
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,750
what did you say no I was to to contrast
it uh go ahead and hinge backwards there

754
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:42,760
it uh go ahead and hinge backwards there
 

755
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,990
it uh go ahead and hinge backwards there
you see

756
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000

 

757
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,350

that that's different totally different

758
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
that that's different totally different
 

759
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,630
that that's different totally different
okay if he can hinge at his waist then

760
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:55,640
okay if he can hinge at his waist then
 

761
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,590
okay if he can hinge at his waist then
he does not need to come forward

762
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:58,600
he does not need to come forward
 

763
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,190
he does not need to come forward
he has control over his body okay so uh

764
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,200
he has control over his body okay so uh
 

765
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,750
he has control over his body okay so uh
he'll come forward hinge at his waist

766
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:06,760
he'll come forward hinge at his waist
 

767
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,950
he'll come forward hinge at his waist
and then I'll

768
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:09,960

because his body is going to be
 

809
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,310
because his body is going to be
rigid what I'm going to do is spiral
