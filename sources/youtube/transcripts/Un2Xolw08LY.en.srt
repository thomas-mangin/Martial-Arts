hi I'm Christopher Hine and we're
 

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,179
hi I'm Christopher Hine and we're
talking about footwork this week so

6
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:20,189
talking about footwork this week so
 

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,529
talking about footwork this week so
that's maybe a little bit of a misnomer

8
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:21,539
that's maybe a little bit of a misnomer
 

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,230
that's maybe a little bit of a misnomer
for this video because we're not

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,240
for this video because we're not
 

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,700
for this video because we're not
strategically talking about footwork in

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:25,710
strategically talking about footwork in
 

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,349
strategically talking about footwork in
this video we're gonna talk about the

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
this video we're gonna talk about the
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
this video we're gonna talk about the
tie no kinko and the town of Hanko is

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:28,890
tie no kinko and the town of Hanko is
 

17
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,099
tie no kinko and the town of Hanko is
the variation position between you and

18
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:31,109
the variation position between you and
 

19
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,840
the variation position between you and
the other person that could be your

20
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:32,850
the other person that could be your
 

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,670
the other person that could be your
attacker or whatever it is that you need

22
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:34,680
attacker or whatever it is that you need
 

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,560
attacker or whatever it is that you need
to position yourself differently to so

24
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:36,570
to position yourself differently to so
 

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,810
to position yourself differently to so
Aikido has a set of tie no Hanko that

26
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:38,820
Aikido has a set of tie no Hanko that
 

27
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,760
Aikido has a set of tie no Hanko that
are key the tiny Lenco are actually the

28
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:40,770
are key the tiny Lenco are actually the
 

29
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,060
are key the tiny Lenco are actually the
way we vary the position and then the

30
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,070
way we vary the position and then the
 

31
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,459
way we vary the position and then the
new position is a thing unto itself so

32
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:46,469
new position is a thing unto itself so
 

33
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,840
new position is a thing unto itself so
we're going to talk a little bit about

34
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:47,850
we're going to talk a little bit about
 

35
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,549
we're going to talk a little bit about
the actual positions and then how we

36
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,559
the actual positions and then how we
 

37
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,740
the actual positions and then how we
vary the line to get to those different

38
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:51,750
vary the line to get to those different
 

39
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,569
vary the line to get to those different
positions and what that is and so

40
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:53,579
positions and what that is and so
 

41
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,069
positions and what that is and so
there's only have a few basic ways we do

42
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
there's only have a few basic ways we do
 

43
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,470
there's only have a few basic ways we do
this there's 60 no Hanko six position

44
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
this there's 60 no Hanko six position
 

45
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,760
this there's 60 no Hanko six position
variations and we can do that from

46
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:58,770
variations and we can do that from
 

47
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,069
variations and we can do that from
either an eye hung me or a doctor on me

48
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,079
either an eye hung me or a doctor on me
 

49
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,049
either an eye hung me or a doctor on me
we'll also talk in this video about what

50
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
we'll also talk in this video about what
 

51
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,570
we'll also talk in this video about what
I and yaku hanmi really are so instead

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:05,580
I and yaku hanmi really are so instead
 

53
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,800
I and yaku hanmi really are so instead
of just thinking of it as a static

54
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,810
of just thinking of it as a static
 

55
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,690
of just thinking of it as a static
position it's actually a position that's

56
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:08,700
position it's actually a position that's
 

57
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,210
position it's actually a position that's
constantly in flux so I might tell Josh

58
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,220
constantly in flux so I might tell Josh
 

59
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,320

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:13,860
about the tie no hanko both the basic
 

63
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,980
about the tie no hanko both the basic
positions and the variation of positions

64
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:15,990
positions and the variation of positions
 

65
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,840
positions and the variation of positions
themselves hey Josh okay so we're gonna

66
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:20,850
themselves hey Josh okay so we're gonna
 

67

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:24,930
could lumped I know Hank go in with
 

71
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,899
could lumped I know Hank go in with
footwork and we're kind of doing that in

72
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:26,909
footwork and we're kind of doing that in
 

73
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,940
footwork and we're kind of doing that in
this video just because the the basic

74
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:28,950
this video just because the the basic
 

75
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,530
this video just because the the basic
footwork for Aikido is pretty simple so

76
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:30,540
footwork for Aikido is pretty simple so
 

77
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,270
footwork for Aikido is pretty simple so

another person while all she samake can
happen totally by yourself so you can do

94
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:47,970
happen totally by yourself so you can do
 

95
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,760
happen totally by yourself so you can do
the basic footwork patterns completely

96
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:49,770
the basic footwork patterns completely
 

97
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,960
the basic footwork patterns completely
by yourself but whenever we're talking

98
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
by yourself but whenever we're talking
 

99
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,850
by yourself but whenever we're talking
about Tai nameko we're talking about

100
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:52,860
about Tai nameko we're talking about
 

101
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,380
about Tai nameko we're talking about
always being in relation to another

102
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,390
always being in relation to another
 

103
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,060
always being in relation to another
person so first let's talk about what

104
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,070
person so first let's talk about what
 

105
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,219
person so first let's talk about what
the basic rough positions are so just

106
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:58,229
the basic rough positions are so just
 

107
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,569
the basic rough positions are so just
just seeing square eye makes you move

108
00:01:59,569 --> 00:01:59,579
just seeing square eye makes you move
 

109
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,069
just seeing square eye makes you move
that way just a little bit perfect right

110
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:01,079
that way just a little bit perfect right
 

111
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,859
that way just a little bit perfect right
there okay so this is one of the worst

112
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:03,869
there okay so this is one of the worst
 

113
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,330
there okay so this is one of the worst
positions to be so I'm gonna show you

114
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,340
positions to be so I'm gonna show you
 

115
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,580
positions to be so I'm gonna show you
the absolute worst position for me this

116
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590
the absolute worst position for me this
 

117
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,199
the absolute worst position for me this
is the worst position for me

118
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,209
is the worst position for me
 

119
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,180
is the worst position for me
now the reason is that guys behind me

120
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,190
now the reason is that guys behind me
 

121
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,120
now the reason is that guys behind me
terrible all my tools

122
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,130
terrible all my tools
 

123
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,220
terrible all my tools
here Smitty I was gonna hit him or kick

124
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,230
here Smitty I was gonna hit him or kick
 

125
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,780
here Smitty I was gonna hit him or kick
him he's not in the right position for

126
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:16,790
him he's not in the right position for
 

127
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,100
him he's not in the right position for
that if I was gonna use a weapon he's

128
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,110
that if I was gonna use a weapon he's
 

129
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,360
that if I was gonna use a weapon he's
not in the right position for that in

130
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,370
not in the right position for that in
 

131
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,040
not in the right position for that in
order to see him I gotta turn around so

132
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,050
order to see him I gotta turn around so
 

133
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,630
order to see him I gotta turn around so
this is the worst position I can be

134
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
this is the worst position I can be
 

135
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,060
this is the worst position I can be
absolutely worse right but this isn't

136
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,070
absolutely worse right but this isn't
 

137
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,740
absolutely worse right but this isn't
all that much better so now I could

138
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,750
all that much better so now I could
 

139
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,530
all that much better so now I could
defend myself but really he can hit as

140
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:29,540
defend myself but really he can hit as
 

141
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,930
defend myself but really he can hit as
hard as I can so word the same amount of

142
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:31,940
hard as I can so word the same amount of
 

143
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,240
hard as I can so word the same amount of
power he can hit me every time back as

144
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,250
power he can hit me every time back as
 

145
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,320
power he can hit me every time back as
hard as I kid him

146
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,330
hard as I kid him
 

147
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,820
hard as I kid him
now if he's stronger than me which is

148
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:36,830
now if he's stronger than me which is
 

149
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,560
now if he's stronger than me which is
what we're always accounting for in our

150
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,570
what we're always accounting for in our
 

151
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,110
what we're always accounting for in our
context of Aikido is every time I hit

152
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
context of Aikido is every time I hit
 

153
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,270
context of Aikido is every time I hit
him he's gonna hit me harder so it's a

154
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
him he's gonna hit me harder so it's a
 

155
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,490
him he's gonna hit me harder so it's a
losing proposition so I can never settle

156
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,500
losing proposition so I can never settle
 

157
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,890
losing proposition so I can never settle
for this so I want to at least be a

158
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:47,900
for this so I want to at least be a
 

159
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,590
for this so I want to at least be a
little eschewed from this we call it mu

160
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:50,600
little eschewed from this we call it mu
 

161

241
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,520
step and I could step two two different
ways for all kinds of different reasons

ways for all kinds of different reasons
 

243
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,250
ways for all kinds of different reasons
now if I could manage to get over to the

244
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,260
now if I could manage to get over to the
 

245
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,560

better for me
now the reason is let's move over you're

250
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,670
now the reason is let's move over you're
 

251
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,400
now the reason is let's move over you're
just

252
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,410
just
 

253
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,900
just
okay so the reason that this is a lot

254
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:21,910
okay so the reason that this is a lot
 

255
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,760
okay so the reason that this is a lot
better position is because this whole

256
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:23,770
better position is because this whole
 

257
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,100
better position is because this whole

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,059
leg and even if he had a weapon this
would be a really hard cross body shot

274
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:39,069
would be a really hard cross body shot
 

275
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,730
would be a really hard cross body shot
for him to make so if this is kind of

276
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:41,740
for him to make so if this is kind of
 

277
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,680
for him to make so if this is kind of
hard to understand look again at the

278
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:43,690
hard to understand look again at the
 

279
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,540
hard to understand look again at the
timings video the body timing video and

280
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,550
timings video the body timing video and
 

281
