[Music]

2
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639

 

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,589

so on our

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
so on our
 

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,349
so on our
Crest you have a pattern

6
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
Crest you have a pattern
 

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,070
Crest you have a pattern
and throughout the pattern you have a

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
and throughout the pattern you have a
 

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,870
and throughout the pattern you have a
understanding of East Asian martial arts

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
understanding of East Asian martial arts
 

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,509
understanding of East Asian martial arts
but it's it's not really anything that

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
but it's it's not really anything that
 

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,230
but it's it's not really anything that
esoteric okay

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
esoteric okay
 

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,229
esoteric okay
it has to do that there

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239

 

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,590

are these directions whoops

18
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:38,600
are these directions whoops
 

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,869
are these directions whoops
whatever

20
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
whatever
 

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:52,029
whatever
um so you have one two 3 four five 6 7 8

22
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
um so you have one two 3 four five 6 7 8
 

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,430
um so you have one two 3 four five 6 7 8
you have eight

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,440
you have eight
 

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,750
you have eight
directions the cardinal directions and

26
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:56,760
directions the cardinal directions and
 

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,430
directions the cardinal directions and
the diagonals and these kind of

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
the diagonals and these kind of
 

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,830
the diagonals and these kind of
represent that those are all the

30
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
represent that those are all the
 

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,750
represent that those are all the
directions that that you have okay this

32
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,760
directions that that you have okay this
 

33
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,109
directions that that you have okay this
is why you have like

34
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
is why you have like
 

35
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,950
is why you have like
shidi but you also have haidi so shidi

36
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
shidi but you also have haidi so shidi
 

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,030
shidi but you also have haidi so shidi
is the four cardinal directions like you

38
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
is the four cardinal directions like you
 

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,270
is the four cardinal directions like you
have north

40
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
have north
 

41
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,149
have north
south okay West

42
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
south okay West
 

43
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,830
south okay West
East

44
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:22,840
East
 

45
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,950
East
okay and obviously

46
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:27,960
okay and obviously
 

47
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,270
okay and obviously
Northwest what is this northeast

48
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Northwest what is this northeast
 

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,870
Northwest what is this northeast
East am I doing this right yeah

50
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
East am I doing this right yeah
 

51
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,590
East am I doing this right yeah
Southeast

52
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
Southeast
 

53
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,190
Southeast
Southwest

54
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,200
Southwest
 

55
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,350
Southwest
okay but you also have hooi hoo means

56
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
okay but you also have hooi hoo means
 

57
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,389
okay but you also have hooi hoo means
eight directions so you do that you add

58
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:43,399
eight directions so you do that you add
 

59
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,990
eight directions so you do that you add
the diagonals in okay um it's the same

60
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,000
the diagonals in okay um it's the same
 

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,069
the diagonals in okay um it's the same
in knife fighting you have angles one

62
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
in knife fighting you have angles one
 

63
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,109
in knife fighting you have angles one
angle two all that kind of stuff that's

64
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
angle two all that kind of stuff that's
 

65
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,230
angle two all that kind of stuff that's
in there um we have ski so you also have

66
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,240
in there um we have ski so you also have
 

67
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,429
in there um we have ski so you also have
to understand that there is a

68
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
to understand that there is a
 

69
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,310
to understand that there is a
verticality to this that's going this

70
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,320
verticality to this that's going this
 

71
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,149
verticality to this that's going this
way and so if you look at Ed Parker's

72
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
way and so if you look at Ed Parker's
 

73
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,870
way and so if you look at Ed Parker's
work he'll take that two-dimensional

74
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:07,880
work he'll take that two-dimensional
 

75
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,510
work he'll take that two-dimensional
diagram that we have on our Crest and

76
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,520
diagram that we have on our Crest and
 

77
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,910
diagram that we have on our Crest and
they'll blow it out to a

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
they'll blow it out to a
 

79
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,910
they'll blow it out to a
three-dimensional diagram and you can

80
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
three-dimensional diagram and you can
 

81
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,350
three-dimensional diagram and you can
see what these eight directions look

82
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,360
see what these eight directions look
 

83
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,350
see what these eight directions look
like in a sphere okay and so there's it

84
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
like in a sphere okay and so there's it
 

85
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,910
like in a sphere okay and so there's it
goes out this way too and so that's how

86
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
goes out this way too and so that's how
 

87
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,110
goes out this way too and so that's how
you have ski and you have showen and you

88
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
you have ski and you have showen and you
 

89
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,390
you have ski and you have showen and you
have Yoko men and those represent in

90
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,400
have Yoko men and those represent in
 

91
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,589
have Yoko men and those represent in
those three all the possible directions

92
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
those three all the possible directions
 

93
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,390
those three all the possible directions
that something can go in okay um so as

94
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
that something can go in okay um so as
 

95
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,110
that something can go in okay um so as
as you have yoka man you can always

96
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
as you have yoka man you can always
 

97
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,350
as you have yoka man you can always
reverse it just like you would in in

98
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,360
reverse it just like you would in in
 

99
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,750
reverse it just like you would in in
knife so I have this slash well I have

100
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:40,760
knife so I have this slash well I have
 

101
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,390
knife so I have this slash well I have
that slash you have yo man here and you

102
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,400
that slash you have yo man here and you
 

103
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,190
that slash you have yo man here and you
have your outward hand sword too okay

104
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
have your outward hand sword too okay
 

105
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,830
have your outward hand sword too okay
inward hand sword outward hand sword and

106
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
inward hand sword outward hand sword and
 

107
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,509
inward hand sword outward hand sword and
that would give you the other

108
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:50,519
that would give you the other
 

109
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,949
that would give you the other
angle

110
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
angle
 

111
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,470
angle
um in our

112
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
um in our
 

113
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,750
um in our
Kona the Kona uh curriculum

114
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760

 

115
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,470

them your techniques most of them nearly

116
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
them your techniques most of them nearly
 

117
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,509
them your techniques most of them nearly
all of them will concentrate on these

118
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
all of them will concentrate on these
 

119
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,430
all of them will concentrate on these
angles okay so this one over

120
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
angles okay so this one over
 

121
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,229
angles okay so this one over
here this one over here this one over

122
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,239
here this one over here this one over
 

123
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,550
here this one over here this one over
here this one over

124
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,560
here this one over
 

125
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,509
here this one over
here and this is because these angles

126
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
here and this is because these angles
 

127
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,949
here and this is because these angles
are uh mechanically connected to

128
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959
are uh mechanically connected to
 

129
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,550
are uh mechanically connected to
mid-range

130
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560
mid-range
 

131
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,270
mid-range
grappling um this north south angle or

132
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,280
grappling um this north south angle or
 

133
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,229
grappling um this north south angle or
this right angle here it's very

134
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
this right angle here it's very
 

135
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,390
this right angle here it's very
difficult to move uh the body from the

136
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,400
difficult to move uh the body from the
 

137
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,390
difficult to move uh the body from the
area of the elbows to the wrist and

138
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
area of the elbows to the wrist and
 

139
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,830
area of the elbows to the wrist and
using these these angles the cardinal

140
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:48,840
using these these angles the cardinal
 

141
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,509
using these these angles the cardinal
directions and the reason why is because

142
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
directions and the reason why is because
 

143
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,429
directions and the reason why is because
you're going to contest that's what's

144
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
you're going to contest that's what's
 

145
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,550
you're going to contest that's what's
going to

146
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560
going to
 

147
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,910
going to
happen in close range grappling that

148
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
happen in close range grappling that
 

149
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,949
happen in close range grappling that
that is where you start to see the

150
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
that is where you start to see the
 

151
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,990
that is where you start to see the
cardinal directions okay so in iido Kaza

152
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
cardinal directions okay so in iido Kaza
 

153
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,949
cardinal directions okay so in iido Kaza
if we're doing like kagia and we're

154
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
if we're doing like kagia and we're
 

155
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,630
if we're doing like kagia and we're
clearly at that elbow wrist range of

156
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640
clearly at that elbow wrist range of
 

157
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,110
clearly at that elbow wrist range of
mid-range grappling obviously we throw

158
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,120
mid-range grappling obviously we throw
 

159
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,030
mid-range grappling obviously we throw
at the corners in koshinaga we're at

160
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
at the corners in koshinaga we're at
 

161
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,749
at the corners in koshinaga we're at
close range grappling and that's where

162
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:22,759
close range grappling and that's where
 

163
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,670
close range grappling and that's where
you work on the north south kind of

164
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
you work on the north south kind of
 

165
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,790
you work on the north south kind of
stuff okay you get underneath it it goes

166
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
stuff okay you get underneath it it goes
 

167
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,749
stuff okay you get underneath it it goes
over the top of you Etc okay

168
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759

 

169
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,950

um therefore inversely if we're doing a

170
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
um therefore inversely if we're doing a
 

171
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,550
um therefore inversely if we're doing a
mid-range grappling technique uh we want

172
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
mid-range grappling technique uh we want
 

173
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,550
mid-range grappling technique uh we want
to stay away from this north south and

174
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
to stay away from this north south and
 

175
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,350
to stay away from this north south and
the East West because you're going to

176
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
the East West because you're going to
 

177
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,310
the East West because you're going to
contest okay if we're doing like uh

178
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
contest okay if we're doing like uh
 

179
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,189
contest okay if we're doing like uh
koshinaga double leg single leg any of

180
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
koshinaga double leg single leg any of
 

181
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,390
koshinaga double leg single leg any of
those kind of things uh katuma that's

182
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
those kind of things uh katuma that's
 

183
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,150
those kind of things uh katuma that's
where you start working on those 90°

184
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
where you start working on those 90°
 

185
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,189
where you start working on those 90°
because the guy is actually going over

186
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
because the guy is actually going over
 

187
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,070
because the guy is actually going over
you that's how you don't cont test okay

188
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
you that's how you don't cont test okay
 

189
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,629
you that's how you don't cont test okay
uh why does he have to go over you cuz I

190
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:03,639
uh why does he have to go over you cuz I
 

191
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,870
uh why does he have to go over you cuz I
can't get to the side do you see if I

192
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
can't get to the side do you see if I
 

193
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,510
can't get to the side do you see if I
can get to the side then I get these

194
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
can get to the side then I get these
 

195
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,590
can get to the side then I get these
other angles okay if I'm on the side and

196
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,600
other angles okay if I'm on the side and
 

197
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,670
other angles okay if I'm on the side and
I try to make him go vertical you're

198
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
I try to make him go vertical you're
 

199
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,390
I try to make him go vertical you're
going to get too much mass you're going

200
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,400
going to get too much mass you're going
 

201
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,189
going to get too much mass you're going
to contest you won't have your

202
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
to contest you won't have your
 

203
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,590
to contest you won't have your
mechanical advantage so let me kind of

204
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
mechanical advantage so let me kind of
 

205
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,350
mechanical advantage so let me kind of
demonstrate what that means okay

206
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
demonstrate what that means okay
 

207
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,550
demonstrate what that means okay
okay so if I'm going to do for example

208
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
okay so if I'm going to do for example
 

209
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,670
okay so if I'm going to do for example
cou nuggin and I had to have gotten to

210
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,680
cou nuggin and I had to have gotten to
 

211
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,270
cou nuggin and I had to have gotten to
the angle do you see and then I can

212
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
the angle do you see and then I can
 

213
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,550
the angle do you see and then I can
throw him at those

214
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
throw him at those
 

215
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,029
throw him at those
Corners this

216
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,039

 

217
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,469

one that

218
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479

 

219
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,510

one make

220
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,520
one make
 

221
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,870
one make
sense if I get to the side and I try to

222
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:53,880
sense if I get to the side and I try to
 

223
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,230
sense if I get to the side and I try to
spin

224
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240
spin
 

225
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,870
spin
him this

226
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:57,880
him this
 

227
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,510
him this
way things get heavy heavier okay does

228
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
way things get heavy heavier okay does
 

229
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,110
way things get heavy heavier okay does
that make sense

230
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,120
that make sense
 

231
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,629
that make sense
likewise if I can't get off to the side

232
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
likewise if I can't get off to the side
 

233
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,870
likewise if I can't get off to the side
and I'm here and I try to throw him

234
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
and I'm here and I try to throw him
 

235
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,309
and I'm here and I try to throw him
things get

236
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:15,319

 

237
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,430

heavier so if we're here here's where

238
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,440
heavier so if we're here here's where
 

239
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,510
heavier so if we're here here's where
you can

240
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
you can
 

241
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,870
you can
get things get light again okay all

242
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
get things get light again okay all
 

243
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,270
get things get light again okay all
right C you

244
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,280
right C you
 

245
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,589
right C you
hole is is

246
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:31,599
hole is is

00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,950
hole is is
midrange it's not going to be close

range I and also I got off to the side I

250
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:37,599
range I and also I got off to the side I
 

251
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,830
range I and also I got off to the side I
got off the line so I don't want to use

252
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
got off the line so I don't want to use
 

253
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,870
got off the line so I don't want to use
the cardinal

254
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
the cardinal
 

255
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,430
the cardinal
direction

down

258
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:49,960

 

259
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,749

up he should not go

260
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:52,759
up he should not go
 

261
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,909
up he should not go
down I don't make his head go

262
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
down I don't make his head go
 

263
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,670
down I don't make his head go
down they bring it up and then

264
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:00,680
down they bring it up and then
 

265
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,670
down they bring it up and then
down so you could

266
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
down so you could
 

267
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,309
down so you could
see if he gets to the side and he goes

268
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:07,319
see if he gets to the side and he goes
 

269
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,749
see if he gets to the side and he goes
and he brings me down okay I'm down my

goes down I don't
think okay but no one does that in real

284
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,520
think okay but no one does that in real

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
life you guys might have experienced
 

287
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,390
life you guys might have experienced
this in G was that when you bring you're

288
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
this in G was that when you bring you're
 

289
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,469
this in G was that when you bring you're
like you're going to take the guy down

290
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
like you're going to take the guy down
 

291
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,629
like you're going to take the guy down
right you go like down and then you

292
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
right you go like down and then you
 

293
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,869
right you go like down and then you
always try to go up and they're just

294
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
always try to go up and they're just
 

295
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,749
always try to go up and they're just
sitting there so he goes he goes down

296
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
sitting there so he goes he goes down
 

297
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,270
sitting there so he goes he goes down
and then like here and he tries to go up

298
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
and then like here and he tries to go up
 

299
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,350
and then like here and he tries to go up
and like no we're not going up cuz you

300
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,360
and like no we're not going up cuz you
 

301
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,149
and like no we're not going up cuz you
took me down okay

302
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:01,159

 

303
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,589

so this his head needs to come at the

304
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
so this his head needs to come at the
 

305
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,749
so this his head needs to come at the

angle not
 

307
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,029
angle not
down not down St there and then I round

308
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:16,039

 

309
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,430

311
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,629

and then I round
 

317
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,469
and then I round
vertical that's not it that would only

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:35,479
vertical that's not it that would only
 

319
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,670
vertical that's not it that would only
work if he does that for me okay I have

320
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
work if he does that for me okay I have
 

321
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,610
work if he does that for me okay I have
to bring his head this

322
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,620

then my hand is here

342
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:30,440
then my hand is here
 

343
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,829
then my hand is here

under it he'll go flying by me okay so
 

459
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,990

you have to match the energy that he has

try so uh

all I need for the throw to happen to

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:06,680
ever happen is that that's all I need
 

473
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,910
ever happen is that that's all I need
for any mid-range grappling throw that's

474
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
for any mid-range grappling throw that's
 

475
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,310
for any mid-range grappling throw that's
it okay you never

476
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,320
it okay you never
 

477
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,990
it okay you never
need

478
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
need
 

479
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,550
need
that

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:17,560
that
 

481
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,550
that
okay so if you're if you get here what

482
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:21,560
okay so if you're if you get here what
 

483
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,069
okay so if you're if you get here what
tends to happen is you get here and

484
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
tends to happen is you get here and
 

485
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,430
tends to happen is you get here and
you're going to move your elbow back

486

that way
 

489

that way
to get him to start going backwards you

490
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:32,680
to get him to start going backwards you
 

491
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,269
to get him to start going backwards you
see and you don't want

492
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
see and you don't want
 

493
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,230

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,320
where my leg comes in do you understand
 

499

00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,949
and now it's realistic okay if I get a
little tilt and all I'm trying to do

502
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
little tilt and all I'm trying to do
 

503
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,910
little tilt and all I'm trying to do
with the arm is get energy that was

504
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:54,920
with the arm is get energy that was
 

505
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,189
with the arm is get energy that was
going forward to going backwards that's

506
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
going forward to going backwards that's
 

507
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,910
going forward to going backwards that's
all I need and then p and you're in okay

508
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:00,920
all I need and then p and you're in okay
 

509
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,829
all I need and then p and you're in okay
so here's here would be his spine it

510
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:04,839
so here's here would be his spine it
 

511
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,509
so here's here would be his spine it
tilts this

512
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:06,519
tilts this
 

513
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,150
tilts this
way legs go forward Center goes forward

514
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
way legs go forward Center goes forward
 

515
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,470
way legs go forward Center goes forward
that makes the head go back before he

516
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,480
that makes the head go back before he
 

517
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,749
that makes the head go back before he
walks here he's never going to walk

518
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:16,759
walks here he's never going to walk
 

519
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,389
walks here he's never going to walk
there

520
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
there
 

521
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,310
there
okay he's coming in he tilts Center

522
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,320
okay he's coming in he tilts Center
 

523
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,470
okay he's coming in he tilts Center
keeps going forward he starts going

524
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
keeps going forward he starts going
 

525
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,749
keeps going forward he starts going
backwards I'm in okay

526
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:29,759
backwards I'm in okay
 

527
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,389
backwards I'm in okay
and as I'm

528
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,399
and as I'm
 

529
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,389
and as I'm
in

530
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399
in
 

531
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,069
in
Boom the legs start to come up the head

532
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:37,079
Boom the legs start to come up the head
 

533
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,670
Boom the legs start to come up the head
starts to go down you see and that's

534
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,680
starts to go down you see and that's
 

535
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,150
starts to go down you see and that's
where my arm now takes it's going to

536
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
where my arm now takes it's going to
 

537
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,189
where my arm now takes it's going to
take that

538
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:46,199
take that
 

539
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,870
take that
inertia and guide it

540
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:49,880
inertia and guide it
 

541
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,829
inertia and guide it
around this way so it's falling and I'm

542
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
around this way so it's falling and I'm
 

543
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,030
around this way so it's falling and I'm
going like that now there's no way he

544
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
going like that now there's no way he
 

545
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,310
going like that now there's no way he
can get his legs back underneath him

546
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
can get his legs back underneath him
 

547
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,269
can get his legs back underneath him
okay does that make sense I'm never

548
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
okay does that make sense I'm never
 

549
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,110
okay does that make sense I'm never
bending this in half and pushing it

550
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,120
bending this in half and pushing it
 

551
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,949
bending this in half and pushing it
straight down I think that a lot of

552
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
straight down I think that a lot of
 

553
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,910
straight down I think that a lot of
people don't do this first part

554
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
people don't do this first part
 

555
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,150
people don't do this first part
sometimes out of ignorance you're

sometimes out of ignorance you're
 

557
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,870
sometimes out of ignorance you're
working on the vertical plane and you

working on the vertical plane and you
 

559
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,829
working on the vertical plane and you
don't want to work on the vertical

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
going to fix it for you okay but
 

565
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,030
going to fix it for you okay but
sometimes they do it when they don't

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
sometimes they do it when they don't
 

567
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,350
sometimes they do it when they don't
realize that throws have to be

568
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,360
realize that throws have to be
 

569
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,670
realize that throws have to be

incremental
 

571
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,309
incremental
mentally uh built you can't you're never

572
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:35,319
mentally uh built you can't you're never
 

573
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,590
mentally uh built you can't you're never
going to have like you got them okay

574
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:38,600
going to have like you got them okay
 

575
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,870
going to have like you got them okay
it's not like that they're all

576
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:39,880
it's not like that they're all
 

577
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,430
it's not like that they're all
incrementally built meaning one thing

578
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:42,440
incrementally built meaning one thing
 

579
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,949
incrementally built meaning one thing
only does a little tiny thing and then

580
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
only does a little tiny thing and then
 

581
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,910
only does a little tiny thing and then
another thing does another little tiny

582
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:46,920
another thing does another little tiny
 

583
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,150
another thing does another little tiny
thing do you see when one thing has to

584
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,160
thing do you see when one thing has to
 

585
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,710
thing do you see when one thing has to
do a whole lot of it's not

586
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:51,720
do a whole lot of it's not
 

587
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,870
do a whole lot of it's not
practical it's never going to happen

588
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:53,880
practical it's never going to happen
 

589
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,309
practical it's never going to happen
Okay

590
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:55,319
Okay
 

591
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,389
Okay
so I don't need this arm

592
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399
so I don't need this arm
 

593
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,829
so I don't need this arm
to make his head go backwards I just

594
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:02,839
to make his head go backwards I just
 

595
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,230
to make his head go backwards I just
need this arm to make his inertia go

596
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
need this arm to make his inertia go
 

597
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,670
need this arm to make his inertia go
backwards and to tilt him at the

598
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:08,680
backwards and to tilt him at the
 

599
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,309
backwards and to tilt him at the
beginning so tilt him in and have his

600
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:11,319
beginning so tilt him in and have his
 

601
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,470
beginning so tilt him in and have his
inertia go back that was it after that

602
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
inertia go back that was it after that
 

603
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,030
inertia go back that was it after that
it stops the legs come in and now as

604
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
it stops the legs come in and now as
 

605
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,509
it stops the legs come in and now as
he's falling this arm comes around and

606
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:22,519
he's falling this arm comes around and
 

607
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,309
he's falling this arm comes around and
brings his head over here okay does that

608
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:25,319
brings his head over here okay does that
 

609
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,269
brings his head over here okay does that
make sense so I think as you're going

610
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:30,279
make sense so I think as you're going
 

611
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,189
make sense so I think as you're going
that's where this temptation comes from

612
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
that's where this temptation comes from
 

613
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,350
that's where this temptation comes from
you shove them back like

614
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
you shove them back like
 

615
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,509
you shove them back like
that don't need that you just get his

616
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:38,519
that don't need that you just get his
 

617
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,189
that don't need that you just get his
inertia going in your

618
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
inertia going in your
 

619
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,269
inertia going in your
in that's all you're doing so if you

620
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
in that's all you're doing so if you
 

621
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,269
in that's all you're doing so if you
paid attention I left my hand up and his

622
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
paid attention I left my hand up and his
 

623
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,550
paid attention I left my hand up and his
head he went that way he didn't go this

624
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,560
head he went that way he didn't go this
 

625
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,470
head he went that way he didn't go this
way you think okay does that make sense

626
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
way you think okay does that make sense
 

627
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,790
way you think okay does that make sense
so I'm going to leave my hands up and

628
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
so I'm going to leave my hands up and
 

629
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:10,029
so I'm going to leave my hands up and
come in more going on that

630
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,039

 

631
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,710

way that way once I bring my hand in

632
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
way that way once I bring my hand in
 

633
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,390
way that way once I bring my hand in
once he gets

634
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,400
once he gets
 

635
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:31,190
once he gets
light goes that way

636
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200

 

637
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,510

you see okay okay

638
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
you see okay okay
 

639
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,470
you see okay okay
um it's important to

640
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
um it's important to
 

641
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,710
um it's important to
note that my

642
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:41,720
note that my
 

643
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,110
note that my
arm is never going

644
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
arm is never going
 

645
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,230
arm is never going
and making him go that

646
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,240

 

647
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,990

way nor does my

648
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
way nor does my
 

649
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,950
way nor does my
arm make him go

650
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960

 

651
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,630

down so my arm is never working okay

652
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:01,640
down so my arm is never working okay
 

653
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,510
down so my arm is never working okay
there's nothing in my

654
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:04,520
there's nothing in my
 

655
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,870
there's nothing in my
arm

656
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:07,880

 

657
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,510

um let's

658
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:10,520
um let's
 

659
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,990
um let's
see as as we're here the inertia is

660
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,000
see as as we're here the inertia is
 

661
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,669
see as as we're here the inertia is
making him go that way so disarm didn't

662
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:18,679
making him go that way so disarm didn't
 

663
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,549
making him go that way so disarm didn't
do any of

664
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
do any of
 

665
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,870
do any of
