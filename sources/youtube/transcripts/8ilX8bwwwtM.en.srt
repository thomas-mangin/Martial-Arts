lower than this part you see that so
 

329
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,509
lower than this part you see that so
basically you're pulling it down you

330
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:58,519
basically you're pulling it down you
 

331
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,829
basically you're pulling it down you
understand that yes and so that means

332
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
understand that yes and so that means
 

333
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,629
understand that yes and so that means
this part is heavy push down do you

334
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:05,639
this part is heavy push down do you
 

335
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,150
this part is heavy push down do you
see that's going to make this part light

336
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,160
see that's going to make this part light
 

337
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,629
see that's going to make this part light
and that's why you can't hit my hands

338
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:12,639
and that's why you can't hit my hands
 

339
