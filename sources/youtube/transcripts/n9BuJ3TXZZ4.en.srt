my arm is almost hyper-extended do you

172
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,580
my arm is almost hyper-extended do you
 

173
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,480
my arm is almost hyper-extended do you
see that what else is different

174
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,490

 

175
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,850

yeah my shoulders are smaller do you see

176
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:31,860
yeah my shoulders are smaller do you see
 

177
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,100
yeah my shoulders are smaller do you see
do you see how I'm doing that okay

178
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,110
do you see how I'm doing that okay
 

179
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,589
do you see how I'm doing that okay
this was the other angle and this is the

180
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:39,599
this was the other angle and this is the
 

181
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,609
this was the other angle and this is the
same do you see that it was true you're

182
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:43,619
same do you see that it was true you're
 

183
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,170
same do you see that it was true you're
able to stop him

184
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,180
able to stop him
 

185
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,529
able to stop him
do you see that but this will not get

186
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539
do you see that but this will not get
 

187
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,189
do you see that but this will not get
you to the next level so do not just

188
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:52,199
you to the next level so do not just
 

189
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,879
you to the next level so do not just
stop him do the form trust the method

190
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:57,889
stop him do the form trust the method
 

191
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,769

look I can't even get there you
see that oh I did the other and

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,010

 

207
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:46,510

let's do this one was his jumper

208
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520

 

209
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480

this is me trying the same biomechanical

210
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,490
this is me trying the same biomechanical
 

211
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,930

but never gonna gain leverage there's

214
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:58,669
but never gonna gain leverage there's
 

215
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,230
but never gonna gain leverage there's
just no way you'll see people like right

216
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
just no way you'll see people like right
 

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,050
just no way you'll see people like right
but what I ultimately want isn't even

isolated muscle flexion okay I'm going

224
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,280
isolated muscle flexion okay I'm going
 

225
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,460
isolated muscle flexion okay I'm going
to change this drill so you can see what

226
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,470
to change this drill so you can see what
 

227
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,909
to change this drill so you can see what
I'm doing keep pushing

many ways you get it do it out like this
 

241
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,290
many ways you get it do it out like this
do it like this you could have done this

I'm using that phrase to describe this
angle positioning of the shoulder that's

486
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
angle positioning of the shoulder that's
 

487
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,659
angle positioning of the shoulder that's
locked okay I'm just doing this so if I

488
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:52,669
locked okay I'm just doing this so if I
 

489
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,599
locked okay I'm just doing this so if I
leave by torso here on my arm swings

490
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:55,609
leave by torso here on my arm swings
 

491
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,830
leave by torso here on my arm swings
look it came changed you see that or I

492
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
look it came changed you see that or I
 

493
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,470
look it came changed you see that or I
lets-a-go didn't change didn't change

494
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
lets-a-go didn't change didn't change
 

495
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,070
lets-a-go didn't change didn't change
but now I'm gonna go like this changed

496
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
but now I'm gonna go like this changed
 

497
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,479
but now I'm gonna go like this changed
do you see that

498

if I walk my hand here right I'm going
 

501
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,930
if I walk my hand here right I'm going
to have to turn it do you see turn it

502
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:16,940
to have to turn it do you see turn it
 

503
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,090
to have to turn it do you see turn it
and move you see that

504
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,100
and move you see that
 

505
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,419
and move you see that
so that's what I'm doing at the end all

506
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:24,429
so that's what I'm doing at the end all
 

507
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,789
so that's what I'm doing at the end all
you pay attention to the shoulder I

508
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
you pay attention to the shoulder I
 

509
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
you pay attention to the shoulder I
wanted it out there I've moved a whole

510
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:28,809
wanted it out there I've moved a whole
 

511
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,259
wanted it out there I've moved a whole
unit up there right I wanted to come

512
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:31,269
unit up there right I wanted to come
 

513
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,810
unit up there right I wanted to come
around I have to turn my hat so that

514
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:33,820
around I have to turn my hat so that
 

515
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,100
around I have to turn my hat so that
shoulder stays there

516
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,110
shoulder stays there
 

517
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,710
shoulder stays there
if this spot was not enough I had to

518
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:37,720
if this spot was not enough I had to
 

519
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,730
if this spot was not enough I had to
turn my whole button do you see them but

520
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:41,740
turn my whole button do you see them but
 

521
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,259
turn my whole button do you see them but
do you know all that your solar change

522
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:43,269
do you know all that your solar change
 

523
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,169
do you know all that your solar change
it changed you're here and then at this

524
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:46,179
it changed you're here and then at this
 

525
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,149
it changed you're here and then at this
point a lot of you want to just knock

526
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:48,159
point a lot of you want to just knock
 

527
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,999
point a lot of you want to just knock
the guy down and you changed it do you

528
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:51,009
the guy down and you changed it do you
 

529
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,610
the guy down and you changed it do you
see that sometimes you're pretty good

530
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:53,620
see that sometimes you're pretty good
 

531
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,129
see that sometimes you're pretty good
you're here like that you kind of got up

532
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:56,139
you're here like that you kind of got up
 

533
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,180
you're here like that you kind of got up
and then you go like that

534
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,190
and then you go like that
 

535
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,779
and then you go like that
and you changed it okay so leave the

536
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:00,789
and you changed it okay so leave the
 

537
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:17,490
and you changed it okay so leave the
form for the other people the way you

538
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:17,500
form for the other people the way you
 

539
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,310
form for the other people the way you
feel it is to leave the form okay that's

540
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,320
feel it is to leave the form okay that's
 

541
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,600
feel it is to leave the form okay that's
what I mean so I kind of don't care by

542
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:27,610
what I mean so I kind of don't care by
 

543
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:50,120
what I mean so I kind of don't care by
anything I want to test myself

544
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,130

 

545
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,450

taking people he will trigger me that's

546
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:54,460
taking people he will trigger me that's
 

547
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,130
taking people he will trigger me that's
why it's a psychological thing

548
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,140
why it's a psychological thing
 

549
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,010
why it's a psychological thing
he will trigger me and I would put those

550
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,020
he will trigger me and I would put those
 

551
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:10,549
he will trigger me and I would put those
pieces so when you trigger to me okay

552
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
pieces so when you trigger to me okay
 

553
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,360
pieces so when you trigger to me okay
that's not purely physical so when I say

554
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,370
that's not purely physical so when I say
 

555
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,560
that's not purely physical so when I say
releasing that's what I'm going to use a

556
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,570
releasing that's what I'm going to use a
 

557
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,820
releasing that's what I'm going to use a
spiritual psychological emotional

558
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:22,830
spiritual psychological emotional
 

559
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,159
spiritual psychological emotional
letting go I can't I don't even know

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:26,169
letting go I can't I don't even know
 

561
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:28,230
letting go I can't I don't even know
what I'm letting go off to tell you the

562
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
what I'm letting go off to tell you the
 

563
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,590
what I'm letting go off to tell you the
truth because I don't understand how

564
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
truth because I don't understand how
 

565
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,029
truth because I don't understand how
it's doing it I just know if I release

566
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
it's doing it I just know if I release
 

567
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,779
it's doing it I just know if I release
then I'm now working with something else

568
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:38,789
then I'm now working with something else
 

569
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,070
then I'm now working with something else
okay

570
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080

 

571
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,070

okay so right now I'm going to explain

572
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
okay so right now I'm going to explain
 

573
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,780
okay so right now I'm going to explain
to you why you want to move further

574
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:51,790
to you why you want to move further
 

575
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,070
to you why you want to move further
obviously you saw that there's more

576
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
obviously you saw that there's more
 

577
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,970
obviously you saw that there's more
workload and then there's more energy

578
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:56,980
workload and then there's more energy
 

579
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,510
workload and then there's more energy
conservation okay those are good skills

580
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
conservation okay those are good skills
 

581
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,190
conservation okay those are good skills
provided okay but here is because this

582
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,200
provided okay but here is because this
 

583
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,200
provided okay but here is because this
one I called it while mechanically sound

584
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,210
one I called it while mechanically sound
 

585
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,350
one I called it while mechanically sound
remember okay and what you didn't

586
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,360
remember okay and what you didn't
 

587
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,190
remember okay and what you didn't
realize is bio mechanically sound from a

588
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,200
realize is bio mechanically sound from a
 

589
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,080
realize is bio mechanically sound from a
particular vector only by default it's

590
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,090
particular vector only by default it's
 

591
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,430
particular vector only by default it's
on sound from every other vector you get

592
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
on sound from every other vector you get
 

593
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,670
on sound from every other vector you get
it otherwise you could do anything and I

594
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:30,680
it otherwise you could do anything and I
 

595
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:39,310
it otherwise you could do anything and I
said you can't do anything okay so he

596
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,320
said you can't do anything okay so he
 

597
00:21:39,320 --> 00:22:15,580
said you can't do anything okay so he
goes there you go you see okay so it's

598
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:15,590
goes there you go you see okay so it's
 

599
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,750
goes there you go you see okay so it's
the same thing

600
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
the same thing
 

601
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,750
the same thing
the second I try to do this externally

602
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
the second I try to do this externally
 

603
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,850
the second I try to do this externally
we're going to call next Girona I can't

604
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:23,860
we're going to call next Girona I can't
 

605
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,550
we're going to call next Girona I can't
do it oh well I didn't know why the

606
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:26,560
do it oh well I didn't know why the
 

607
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,880
do it oh well I didn't know why the
other one works so probably were a few

608
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:29,890
other one works so probably were a few
 

609
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,730
other one works so probably were a few
more places than the other one so when

610
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:32,740
more places than the other one so when
 

611
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:41,510
more places than the other one so when
we're here so it's almost the workload

612
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
we're here so it's almost the workload
 

613
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,510
we're here so it's almost the workload
capacity I would say is smaller in

614
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
capacity I would say is smaller in
 

615
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,900
capacity I would say is smaller in
importance because any movement that I

616
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:48,910
importance because any movement that I
 

617
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,500
importance because any movement that I
have to do has to maintain integrity

618
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,510
have to do has to maintain integrity
 

619
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,040
have to do has to maintain integrity
through space you see that and if it

620
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,050
through space you see that and if it
 

621
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,490
through space you see that and if it
only maintains integrity on a particular

622
00:22:59,490 --> 00:22:59,500
only maintains integrity on a particular
 

623
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,130
only maintains integrity on a particular
vector I'm probably not going to

624
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,140
vector I'm probably not going to
 

625
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,040
vector I'm probably not going to
maintain integrity as I travel through

626
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,050
maintain integrity as I travel through
 

627
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,760
maintain integrity as I travel through
space okay because forces start acting

628
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:08,770
space okay because forces start acting
 

629
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,290
space okay because forces start acting
upon me in many many different

630
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:10,300
upon me in many many different
 

631
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,060
upon me in many many different
directions all right so the more pieces

632
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,070
directions all right so the more pieces
 

633
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,360
directions all right so the more pieces
you take out the more external pieces

634
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,370
you take out the more external pieces
 

635
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,060
you take out the more external pieces
you take out and it's still able to

636
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,070
you take out and it's still able to
 

637
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,780
you take out and it's still able to
maintain integrity the more vectors you

638
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:24,790
maintain integrity the more vectors you
 

639
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,780
maintain integrity the more vectors you
can actually still maintain integrity

640
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:27,790
can actually still maintain integrity
 

641
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:38,830
can actually still maintain integrity
good bye okay

642
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:38,840

 

643
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,900
