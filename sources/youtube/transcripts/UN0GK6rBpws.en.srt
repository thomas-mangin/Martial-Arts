00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,080
think it's the dumbest attack in history
the reason is because it's holding both

68
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,090
the reason is because it's holding both
 

69
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,760
the reason is because it's holding both
of my wrists from behind and it seems

70
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:19,770
of my wrists from behind and it seems
 

71
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,530
of my wrists from behind and it seems
like there's a whole lot better options

72
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,540
like there's a whole lot better options
 

73

77
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,410
behind then also how would he even get
there how would he get to that position

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,420
there how would he get to that position
 

79
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,020
there how would he get to that position
in the first place right is he just

80
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,030
in the first place right is he just
 

81
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,370
in the first place right is he just
expecting to come across the guy we

82
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,450
would probably be this and then I'll
 

125
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,660
would probably be this and then I'll
begin staffing this guy and I would stab

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,360
reasonable progression as to why that
technique happened I'm trying to stab

162
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,370
technique happened I'm trying to stab
 

163
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,250
technique happened I'm trying to stab
this guy and he's trying to stop me by

164
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,260
this guy and he's trying to stop me by
 

165
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,690
this guy and he's trying to stop me by
holding my wrists here like this until

166
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:51,700
holding my wrists here like this until
 

167
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,220
holding my wrists here like this until
you get to a better position and kick me

168
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,230
you get to a better position and kick me
 

169
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,470
you get to a better position and kick me
or whatever it is he's gonna do okay

170
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
or whatever it is he's gonna do okay
 

171
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,660
or whatever it is he's gonna do okay
so that's how that might come if he were

172
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,670
so that's how that might come if he were
 

173
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,940
so that's how that might come if he were
getting if you were already behind me

174
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,950
getting if you were already behind me
 

175
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,610
getting if you were already behind me
but what if he were moving behind me so

176
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:02,620
but what if he were moving behind me so
 

177
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,590
but what if he were moving behind me so
let's say this guy's attacking me and

178
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:04,600
let's say this guy's attacking me and
 

179
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,900
let's say this guy's attacking me and
I'm moving around here and as I fade out

180
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:06,910
I'm moving around here and as I fade out
 

181
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,150
I'm moving around here and as I fade out
to this side I decide to cut it right so

182
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,160
to this side I decide to cut it right so
 

183
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,949
to this side I decide to cut it right so
I'm gonna cut him because he's real fast

184
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
I'm gonna cut him because he's real fast
 

185
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,390
I'm gonna cut him because he's real fast
and aggressive and coming all over and

186
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
and aggressive and coming all over and
 

187
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,150
and aggressive and coming all over and
he blocks that bangs like this now if he

188
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,160
he blocks that bangs like this now if he
 

189
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,530
he blocks that bangs like this now if he
didn't do anything else I would just

190
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:16,540
didn't do anything else I would just
 

191
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,720
didn't do anything else I would just
move my hand I cut him again but if he's

192
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:18,730
move my hand I cut him again but if he's
 

193
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,160
move my hand I cut him again but if he's
smart he's gonna grab a hold to that

194
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,170
smart he's gonna grab a hold to that
 

195
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,949
smart he's gonna grab a hold to that
wrist like this so when he grabs my

196
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
wrist like this so when he grabs my
 

197
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,569
wrist like this so when he grabs my
wrist like this what's he gonna want to

198
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:24,579
wrist like this what's he gonna want to
 

199
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,280
wrist like this what's he gonna want to
do next improve his position so he's

200
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,290
do next improve his position so he's
 

201
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,809

Cooper she man if I don't do anything
 

207
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,059
Cooper she man if I don't do anything
about it or if as he starts to move

208
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:33,069
about it or if as he starts to move
 

209
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:35,430
about it or if as he starts to move
behind rewind a little bit for me and he

210
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
behind rewind a little bit for me and he
 

211
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,020
behind rewind a little bit for me and he
starts to move behind I switched the

212
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,030
starts to move behind I switched the
 

213
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,789
starts to move behind I switched the
knife into this hand he's gonna go into

214
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
knife into this hand he's gonna go into
 

215
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,890
knife into this hand he's gonna go into
a Shiro Realtek so that's why he's gonna

216
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:40,900
a Shiro Realtek so that's why he's gonna
 

217
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,330
a Shiro Realtek so that's why he's gonna
end up in either one of these on the

218
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,340
end up in either one of these on the
 

219
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,970
end up in either one of these on the
move right so I'm trying to use the

220
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:44,980
move right so I'm trying to use the
 

221
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,440
move right so I'm trying to use the
weapon that helped me control the

222
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,450
weapon that helped me control the
 

223
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,330
weapon that helped me control the
position as this happens and he's trying

224
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,340
position as this happens and he's trying
 

225
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,680
position as this happens and he's trying
to keep himself from getting stabbed

226
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:49,690
to keep himself from getting stabbed
 

227
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,870
to keep himself from getting stabbed
that's why this position is happening

228
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:51,880
that's why this position is happening
 

229
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,759
that's why this position is happening
that's also why we don't have these

230
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:53,769
that's also why we don't have these
 

231
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,490
that's also why we don't have these
common unarmed grappling holds right so

starting to get into a position of maybe

292
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,130
starting to get into a position of maybe
 

293
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,469
starting to get into a position of maybe
worked out of that which would be great

across I get an e Keo here and get into
a really nice dominant position which is

328
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,010
a really nice dominant position which is
 

329
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,370

they're just too strong I can't get in

336
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:28,940
they're just too strong I can't get in
 

337
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,939
they're just too strong I can't get in
anywhere so I'm gonna slide up to the

338
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:30,949
anywhere so I'm gonna slide up to the
 

339
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,740
anywhere so I'm gonna slide up to the
side here and start to break his balance

340
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:32,750
side here and start to break his balance
 

341
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,230
side here and start to break his balance
now understand if I threw them that

342
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,240
now understand if I threw them that
 

343
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,129
now understand if I threw them that
would be fantastic

344
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:36,139
would be fantastic
 

345
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,870
would be fantastic
my goal is not to throw it's just to

346
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:37,880
my goal is not to throw it's just to
 

347
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,250
my goal is not to throw it's just to
make a little room so if you made a

348
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,260
make a little room so if you made a
 

349
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,689
make a little room so if you made a
little room cool maybe I'll get another

350
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:40,699
little room cool maybe I'll get another
 

351
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,310
little room cool maybe I'll get another
position from here and all kinds of

352
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
position from here and all kinds of
 

353
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,839
position from here and all kinds of
other things can happen so I'm just

354
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:43,849
other things can happen so I'm just
 

355
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,580
other things can happen so I'm just
using it to find myself a little space

356
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:45,590
using it to find myself a little space
 

357
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,290
using it to find myself a little space
in time okay

358
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,300
in time okay
 

359
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,089
in time okay
now let's say he's really smart and as I

360
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:49,099
now let's say he's really smart and as I
 

361
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,560
now let's say he's really smart and as I
try to slide to the side he pulled both

362
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,570
try to slide to the side he pulled both
 

363
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,390
try to slide to the side he pulled both
my arms up behind my back like this he's

364
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
my arms up behind my back like this he's
 

365
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,430
my arms up behind my back like this he's
got my arms and now I can't get around I

366
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,440
got my arms and now I can't get around I
 

367
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,020
got my arms and now I can't get around I
can't do anything else that's bad what

368
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,030
can't do anything else that's bad what
 

369
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,909

techniques are built to clear that
 

377
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,740
techniques are built to clear that
weapon hand so I can get back into a

378
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:05,750
weapon hand so I can get back into a
 

379
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,610
weapon hand so I can get back into a
good position

380
