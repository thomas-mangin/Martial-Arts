learn the language you got to figure out

248
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,240
learn the language you got to figure out
 

249
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,870
learn the language you got to figure out
the context and you have to do as much

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,880
the context and you have to do as much
 

251
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,870
the context and you have to do as much
probably more work figuring out what

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
probably more work figuring out what
 

253
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,310
probably more work figuring out what

dichotomous functioning of my mind do

you see that if it was all purely

296
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
you see that if it was all purely
 

297
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,990
you see that if it was all purely
physiological okay so same thing as he's

298
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
physiological okay so same thing as he's
 

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,030
physiological okay so same thing as he's
as he's

pushing this is scary to us do you see

302
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
pushing this is scary to us do you see
 

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,030
pushing this is scary to us do you see
and that is one reason tying it to the

304
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,040
and that is one reason tying it to the
 

305
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,509
and that is one reason tying it to the
first question is we're doing it like

306
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:58,519
first question is we're doing it like
 

307
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,629
first question is we're doing it like
this

308
00:10:59,629 --> 00:10:59,639
this
 

309
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,710
this
we're out here like this you see

310
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
we're out here like this you see
 

311
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,509
we're out here like this you see
or one arm starts to

312
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:06,519
or one arm starts to
 

313
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,750
or one arm starts to
dominate and the other one is just in a

314
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
dominate and the other one is just in a
 

315
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,030
dominate and the other one is just in a
state of flexion like why is my arm here

316
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,040
state of flexion like why is my arm here
 

317
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,430
state of flexion like why is my arm here
just relax your arm do you

318
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,440

 

319
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,990

see

320
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
see
 

321
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,470
see
so if you look at it that way the only

322
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
so if you look at it that way the only
 

323
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,949
so if you look at it that way the only
constant is not whether my arms go in or

324
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
constant is not whether my arms go in or
 

325
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,870
constant is not whether my arms go in or
out the constant the only one between

326
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:31,880
out the constant the only one between
 

327
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,150
out the constant the only one between
everything is my mind how do I

328
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
everything is my mind how do I
 

329
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,629
everything is my mind how do I
spiritually experience him that is the

331
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,990
spiritually experience him that is the

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,000
only
 

333
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,230
only
constant so when we talk about release

334
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
constant so when we talk about release
 

335
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,629
constant so when we talk about release
however you're understanding it you have

336

however you're understanding it you have
 

337
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,910
however you're understanding it you have
to understand that that

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:48,920
to understand that that
 

339
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,710
to understand that that
is probably what is most important how

340
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
is probably what is most important how
 

341
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,430
is probably what is most important how
you are psychologically experiencing it

342
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,440
you are psychologically experiencing it
 

343
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,190
you are psychologically experiencing it
okay so if you take that understanding

344
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,200
okay so if you take that understanding
 

345
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,590

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,029

here

518
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039

 

519
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:18,029

okay switch

520
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:18,039

uh we'll get and Drew out and so you had
 

525
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,070
uh we'll get and Drew out and so you had
one one ability in in the last

526
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
one one ability in in the last
 

527
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,110
one one ability in in the last
UK uh and it

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
presented
 

531
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,950
presented
opportunity okay but if the UK has the

532
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:39,960
opportunity okay but if the UK has the
 

533
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,909
opportunity okay but if the UK has the
skill we're looking

534
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
skill we're looking
 

535
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,510
skill we're looking
for where as she if she's touches you're

536
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
for where as she if she's touches you're
 

537
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,750
for where as she if she's touches you're
already in her body well the same

538
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
already in her body well the same
 

539
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:57,310
already in her body well the same
thing's going to be

540
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,320

 

541
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:06,270

here

542
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,280

 

543
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,310

so this is the marker you want to

544
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,320

 

545
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,549

notice the more connected I am with my

546
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:15,559
notice the more connected I am with my
 

547
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,990
notice the more connected I am with my
center for the person who's

548
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,000
center for the person who's
 

549
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,350
center for the person who's
not they will never it will fail every

550
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,360
not they will never it will fail every
 

551
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,230
not they will never it will fail every
single time

552
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,240

 

553
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,270

okay

554
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280

 

555
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,669

but for the

556
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:32,679
but for the
 

557
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,270
but for the
person who is connected with their

558
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
person who is connected with their
 

559
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,750
person who is connected with their
Center on AA who is connected on their

560
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
Center on AA who is connected on their
 

561
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,190
Center on AA who is connected on their
Center it actually takes less less

562
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
Center it actually takes less less
 

563
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,750
Center it actually takes less less
movement okay takes less

564
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
movement okay takes less
 

565
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,510
movement okay takes less
movement right so he's going to really

566
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:46,520
movement right so he's going to really
 

567
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,310
movement right so he's going to really
project

568
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320

 

569
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,990

me and that's his effort every time can

570
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,000
me and that's his effort every time can
 

571
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,950
me and that's his effort every time can
you see last movement every time do it

572
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
you see last movement every time do it
 

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:10,310
you see last movement every time do it
every time

574
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320

 

575
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,909

you kind of course do it with bigger

576
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
you kind of course do it with bigger
 

577
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,310
you kind of course do it with bigger
movement and you'll get a bigger

578
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
movement and you'll get a bigger
 

579
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,470
movement and you'll get a bigger
reaction because of what he's doing

580
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
reaction because of what he's doing
 

581
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,470
reaction because of what he's doing
okay um now this

582
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,480
okay um now this
 

583
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,909
okay um now this
again there's another marker so let's

584
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
again there's another marker so let's
 

585
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,990
again there's another marker so let's
say

586
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,000

 

587
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,430

not as much Center connection not B it's

588
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
not as much Center connection not B it's
 

589
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,950
not as much Center connection not B it's
not it's not bad okay it's just not at

590
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
not it's not bad okay it's just not at
 

591
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,190
not it's not bad okay it's just not at
that other level

592
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
that other level
 

593
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,310
that other level
okay so as she goes to touch there's

594
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,320
okay so as she goes to touch there's
 

595
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,669
okay so as she goes to touch there's
always a little

596
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
always a little
 

597
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,669
always a little
lag in her Center as she disengages it

598
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
lag in her Center as she disengages it
 

599
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,789
lag in her Center as she disengages it
upon cont just a little a little lag do

600
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
upon cont just a little a little lag do
 

601
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,590
upon cont just a little a little lag do
you see that okay now I can use that to

602
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:56,600
you see that okay now I can use that to
 

603
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,870
you see that okay now I can use that to
keep developing myself

604
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880

 

605
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,230

but if I am trying to throw you and

606
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
but if I am trying to throw you and
 

607
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,710
but if I am trying to throw you and
you're trying to not get killed I will

608
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:09,720
you're trying to not get killed I will
 

609
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,110
you're trying to not get killed I will
always come out of your grip do you

610
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,120
always come out of your grip do you
 

611
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,630
always come out of your grip do you
understand that so I I she's going to

612
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
understand that so I I she's going to
 

613
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,390
understand that so I I she's going to
push and you see I have to pull the

614
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,400
push and you see I have to pull the
 

615
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,630
push and you see I have to pull the
strike as I'm going do you get it do do

616
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
strike as I'm going do you get it do do
 

617
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,789
strike as I'm going do you get it do do
you understand you look confused you get

618
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
you understand you look confused you get
 

619
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,549
you understand you look confused you get
it okay so I I'll slow down what I'm

620
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:25,559
it okay so I I'll slow down what I'm
 

621
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,870
it okay so I I'll slow down what I'm
talking about so uh as as she

622
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:29,880
talking about so uh as as she
 

623
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,430
talking about so uh as as she
pulls herself out of the technique she

624
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,440
pulls herself out of the technique she
 

625
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,669
pulls herself out of the technique she
opens that Yin space that was making her

626
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
opens that Yin space that was making her
 

627
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,190
opens that Yin space that was making her
not projectable opens her up to the same

628
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
not projectable opens her up to the same
 

629
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,390
not projectable opens her up to the same
Center that projected someone boom and

630
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
Center that projected someone boom and
 

631
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,269
Center that projected someone boom and
just knocks the F out of you do you

632
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:49,279
just knocks the F out of you do you
 

633
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,789
just knocks the F out of you do you
understand and then you don't get you

634
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:51,799
understand and then you don't get you
 

635
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,269
understand and then you don't get you
only get one rep as you get okay do do

636
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:54,279
only get one rep as you get okay do do
 

637
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,029
only get one rep as you get okay do do
you get it

638
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039

 

639
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,590

so

640
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
so
 

641
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,669
so
I will I can never hit him in the face

642
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:02,679
I will I can never hit him in the face
 

643
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,990
I will I can never hit him in the face
because his Center will always be

644
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,000
because his Center will always be
 

645
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,149
because his Center will always be
projected out so la last time I did

646
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
projected out so la last time I did
 

647
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,190
projected out so la last time I did
small movements to his projection you

648
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,200
small movements to his projection you
 

649
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,710
small movements to his projection you
see he's trying to project

650
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
see he's trying to project
 

651
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,549
see he's trying to project
me and I did small movements to get

652
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:15,559
me and I did small movements to get
 

653
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,070
me and I did small movements to get
projection but if I do big movements I

654
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
projection but if I do big movements I
 

655
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,110
projection but if I do big movements I
still I will never get near his face do

656
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
still I will never get near his face do
 

657
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,149
still I will never get near his face do
you see that I try to hit his face and

658
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
you see that I try to hit his face and
 

659
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,149
you see that I try to hit his face and
can't hit his face but it launches his

660
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
can't hit his face but it launches his
 

661
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,669
can't hit his face but it launches his
body you see that

662
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:28,679
body you see that
 

663
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,430
body you see that
so this is what I'm talking about we you

664
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:32,440
so this is what I'm talking about we you
 

665
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,590
so this is what I'm talking about we you
cannot make it a kind of conceptual

666
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:36,600
cannot make it a kind of conceptual
 

667
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,310
cannot make it a kind of conceptual
drill like we've been doing you see a

668
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,320
drill like we've been doing you see a
 

669
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,149
drill like we've been doing you see a
practice

670
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159

 

671
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,110

release okay it's still a martial art

672
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,120
release okay it's still a martial art
 

673
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,909
release okay it's still a martial art
and his ability as my ability as UK uh

674
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:52,919
and his ability as my ability as UK uh
 

675
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,230
and his ability as my ability as UK uh
to displace him is what makes me

676
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
to displace him is what makes me
 

677
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,149
to displace him is what makes me
projectable it's also what keeps him

678
00:22:59,149 --> 00:22:59,159
projectable it's also what keeps him
 

679
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,990
projectable it's also what keeps him
able to go full speed and never punch me

680
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
able to go full speed and never punch me
 

681
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,510
able to go full speed and never punch me
in the face do you get it in this case

682
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
in the face do you get it in this case
 

683
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,230
