1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,830

okay so working on the inverse spiral

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
okay so working on the inverse spiral
 

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,190
okay so working on the inverse spiral
i'm going to give this tilt

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
i'm going to give this tilt
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,310
i'm going to give this tilt
that's the opening this is the hole this

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
that's the opening this is the hole this
 

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,430
that's the opening this is the hole this
is the hole right here

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
is the hole right here
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,749
is the hole right here
okay that's the in space

10
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759

 

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,029

so i create that and there it is

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039

 

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,910

now when i use the inward spiral in this

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
now when i use the inward spiral in this
 

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,189
now when i use the inward spiral in this
training drill

16
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
training drill
 

17
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,349
training drill
i don't want to use my arms

18
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
i don't want to use my arms
 

19
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,470
i don't want to use my arms
i leave it where it is and hit like it's

20
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
i leave it where it is and hit like it's
 

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,709
i leave it where it is and hit like it's
simply going to go like this

22
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719

 

23
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,590

there's my body creates the opening

24
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600

 

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,709

you have to watch two things one

26
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
you have to watch two things one
 

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,750
you have to watch two things one
is that you create the so-called opening

28
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
is that you create the so-called opening
 

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,950
is that you create the so-called opening
with your external yin movement of your

30
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
with your external yin movement of your
 

31
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,830
with your external yin movement of your
wrist

32
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
wrist
 

33
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,350
wrist
you see unto

34
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
you see unto
 

35
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,549
you see unto
once you feel you'll that you got him oh

36
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
once you feel you'll that you got him oh
 

37
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,670
once you feel you'll that you got him oh
okay now like that feels pushable

38
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
okay now like that feels pushable
 

39
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,870
okay now like that feels pushable
you start to push out with your hand

40
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
you start to push out with your hand
 

41
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,270
you start to push out with your hand
you'll stop the spiral or you find

42
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
you'll stop the spiral or you find
 

43
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,310
you'll stop the spiral or you find
oh he's going oh keep going

44
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
oh he's going oh keep going
 

45
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,149
oh he's going oh keep going
and you extend just keep the pattern

46
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
and you extend just keep the pattern
 

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:37,670
and you extend just keep the pattern
see it stays here

48
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680

 

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,389

don't chase him harder

50
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
don't chase him harder
 

51
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,990
don't chase him harder
then you always get to make it smaller

52
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
then you always get to make it smaller
 

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:01,910
then you always get to make it smaller
and more relaxed without losing anything

54
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920

 

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,749

okay okay so with my body

56
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
okay okay so with my body
 

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,350
okay okay so with my body
i have to let him fall this way

58
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
i have to let him fall this way
 

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,510
i have to let him fall this way
so i can't go like this

60
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
so i can't go like this
 

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,470
so i can't go like this
he's gonna fall like that

62
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480

 

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,589

so my body i let his energy pass that's

64
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
so my body i let his energy pass that's
 

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:21,990
so my body i let his energy pass that's
where he

66
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
where he
 

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,309
where he
falls

68
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319

 

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,309

i can't bring him this way that's not

70
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
i can't bring him this way that's not
 

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,430
i can't bring him this way that's not
what's happening

72
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
what's happening
 

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,869
what's happening
he needs to come this side forward

74
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
he needs to come this side forward
 

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,110
he needs to come this side forward
so i have to let that side of his body

76
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
so i have to let that side of his body
 

77
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:54,910
so i have to let that side of his body
go back

78
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:54,920

that's not what we're doing okay it's

96
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
that's not what we're doing okay it's
 

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,309
that's not what we're doing okay it's
here's the conflict

98
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
here's the conflict
 

99
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,670
here's the conflict
i am producing the conflict as much as

100
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
i am producing the conflict as much as
 

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,869
i am producing the conflict as much as
he is

102
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
he is
 

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,550
he is
okay so i have the power to

104
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
okay so i have the power to
 

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:58,830
okay so i have the power to
reconcile the conflict

106
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,710

push i
i deconstruct that conflict

112
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
i deconstruct that conflict
 

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,509
i deconstruct that conflict
by not participating in it okay

114
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
by not participating in it okay
 

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,390
by not participating in it okay
so let's go back a step and that will

116
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
so let's go back a step and that will
 

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
so let's go back a step and that will
give you

118
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
give you
 

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,030
give you
the tsuki the hole inside

120
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
the tsuki the hole inside
 

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,790
the tsuki the hole inside
his kazushi pod right here right here

122
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
his kazushi pod right here right here
 

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,350
his kazushi pod right here right here
see right there because that is where

124
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
see right there because that is where
 

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,710
see right there because that is where
the umiyashi the

126
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
the umiyashi the
 

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,230
the umiyashi the
miyasi is made possible if there is no

128
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
miyasi is made possible if there is no
 

129
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,990
miyasi is made possible if there is no
hope

130
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
hope
 

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,030
hope
if all you have is i'm pushing him over

132
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
if all you have is i'm pushing him over
 

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,430
if all you have is i'm pushing him over
when you cannot enter because he has

134
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
when you cannot enter because he has
 

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,189
when you cannot enter because he has
young energy and that's why you have to

136
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
young energy and that's why you have to
 

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,390
young energy and that's why you have to
do arm grappling

138
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
do arm grappling
 

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,710
do arm grappling
okay so let's go back a step in the

140
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
okay so let's go back a step in the
 

141
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,310
okay so let's go back a step in the
inward spiral

142
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
inward spiral
 

143
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,510
inward spiral
and deconstruct it and i should get

144
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
and deconstruct it and i should get
 

145
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,790
and deconstruct it and i should get
the kazushi powder okay so i

146
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
the kazushi powder okay so i
 

147
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,870
the kazushi powder okay so i
i need him to get in this front amber

148
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
i need him to get in this front amber
 

149
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,390
i need him to get in this front amber
kazushi pattern

150
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
kazushi pattern
 

151
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,070
kazushi pattern
so that means his head is coming this

152
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
so that means his head is coming this
 

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,390
so that means his head is coming this
way and his hips gonna go that way

154
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
way and his hips gonna go that way
 

155
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,790
way and his hips gonna go that way
the head goes this way hip goes that way

156
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
the head goes this way hip goes that way
 

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,110
the head goes this way hip goes that way
so i can't do that when i leave my body

158
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
so i can't do that when i leave my body
 

159
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,790
so i can't do that when i leave my body
here

160
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
here
 

161
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,909
here
so this side has to yield boom

162
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
so this side has to yield boom
 

163
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,150
so this side has to yield boom
you see

164
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160

 

165
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,189

this side can't come forward this side

166
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
this side can't come forward this side
 

167
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,070
this side can't come forward this side
goes back

168
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
goes back
 

169
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,390
goes back
that's where i put myself into the hole

170
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
that's where i put myself into the hole
 

171
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:39,350
that's where i put myself into the hole
that's right you're gonna use your arm

172
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
that's right you're gonna use your arm
 

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:57,590
that's right you're gonna use your arm

my hope
do you see but this is not marshall

348
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
do you see but this is not marshall
 

349
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,790
do you see but this is not marshall
that is not mechanically sound so i have

350
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
that is not mechanically sound so i have
 

351
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,190
that is not mechanically sound so i have
to

352
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
to
 

353
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,230
to
get out of the way so that i can walk i

354
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
get out of the way so that i can walk i
 

355
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,790
get out of the way so that i can walk i
can walk easy go around that energy

356
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
can walk easy go around that energy
 

357
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,949
can walk easy go around that energy
so i'm going to go around the grip not

358
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
so i'm going to go around the grip not
 

359
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,990
so i'm going to go around the grip not
clear the grip

360
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
clear the grip
 

361
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,389
clear the grip
okay so i'm going to go around the grip

362
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
okay so i'm going to go around the grip
 

363
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,430
okay so i'm going to go around the grip
not there

364
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
not there
 

365
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,110
not there
this this thing i'm going to go around

366
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
this this thing i'm going to go around
 

367
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,829
this this thing i'm going to go around
the grip

368
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839

 

369
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,870

so i have to quit pushing him

370
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
so i have to quit pushing him
 

371
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,230
so i have to quit pushing him
oh not not there i'll have to go around

372
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
oh not not there i'll have to go around
 

373
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,310
oh not not there i'll have to go around
the grip

374
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
the grip
 

375
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,829
the grip
so we're not going to clear the grip

376
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
so we're not going to clear the grip
 

377
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,910
so we're not going to clear the grip
with the other hand we're just going to

378
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
with the other hand we're just going to
 

379
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,350
with the other hand we're just going to
go around the grip

380
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360

 

381
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,670

okay let's try it

382
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
okay let's try it
 

383
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,790
okay let's try it
okay so just as i have a contention

384
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
okay so just as i have a contention
 

385
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,990
okay so just as i have a contention
and then i'm gonna uh do the suki i see

386
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
and then i'm gonna uh do the suki i see
 

387
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,990
and then i'm gonna uh do the suki i see
there's no weight on me i can stand you

388
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
there's no weight on me i can stand you
 

389
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,829
there's no weight on me i can stand you
see that there's no weight because

390
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
see that there's no weight because
 

391
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,790
see that there's no weight because
i got inside the tsuki okay so the same

392
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
i got inside the tsuki okay so the same
 

393
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,990
i got inside the tsuki okay so the same
thing happens here

394
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
thing happens here
 

395
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,630
thing happens here
uh when i go here i'm not going to push

396
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
uh when i go here i'm not going to push
 

397
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,350
uh when i go here i'm not going to push
on him

398
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
on him
 

399
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,590
on him
i'm going to get inside this sticky over

400
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
i'm going to get inside this sticky over
 

401
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,710
i'm going to get inside this sticky over
here see

402
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
here see
 

403
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,230
here see
inside there

404
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240

 

405
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,350

so i reconcile the first contention

406
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
so i reconcile the first contention
 

407
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,150
so i reconcile the first contention
point bob

408
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
point bob
 

409
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,710
point bob
reconcile the second one reconcile the

410
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
reconcile the second one reconcile the
 

411
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,430
reconcile the second one reconcile the
third one

412
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
third one
 

413
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,269
third one
and then you're gonna want to do that do

414
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
and then you're gonna want to do that do
 

415
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,670
and then you're gonna want to do that do
you see but you want to get in this hole

416
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
you see but you want to get in this hole
 

417
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,470
you see but you want to get in this hole
over here

418
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
over here
 

419
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,630
over here
so i get in this hole by stepping into

420
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
so i get in this hole by stepping into
 

421
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,670
so i get in this hole by stepping into
it and then

422
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
it and then
 

423
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,990
it and then
his arm is easy to do you see

424
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000

 

425
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,190

don't use the arm don't use the arm to

426
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
don't use the arm don't use the arm to
 

427
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,069
don't use the arm don't use the arm to
do it

428
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
do it
 

429
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,550
do it
don't go like this

430
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560

 

431
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,790

you step inside the city and you're just

432
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
you step inside the city and you're just
 

433
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,630
you step inside the city and you're just
inside the suki it's easy

434
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
inside the suki it's easy
 

435
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,190
inside the suki it's easy
you see

436
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200

 

437
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,949

it's like oh there's a little push but

438
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
it's like oh there's a little push but
 

439
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,550
it's like oh there's a little push but
not if i come over here

440
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
not if i come over here
 

441
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,670
not if i come over here
you see and then i find the arm okay so

442
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
you see and then i find the arm okay so
 

443
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,430
you see and then i find the arm okay so
it's how you step it's not what you do

444
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
it's how you step it's not what you do
 

445
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,710
it's how you step it's not what you do
with the arm

446
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
with the arm
 

447
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,150
with the arm
boom i'm inside and on there

448
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
boom i'm inside and on there
 

449
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,509
boom i'm inside and on there
okay so find that second tsuki

450
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
okay so find that second tsuki
 

451
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,430
okay so find that second tsuki
holy so if i add a ten mate you see he's

452
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
holy so if i add a ten mate you see he's
 

453
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,350
holy so if i add a ten mate you see he's
flying into that side right he was

454
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
flying into that side right he was
 

455
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,389
flying into that side right he was
coming this way

456
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
coming this way
 

457
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,069
coming this way
he's pushing it right up boom you're

458
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
he's pushing it right up boom you're
 

459
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,230
he's pushing it right up boom you're
going to hit him on that side you get it

pushing on me
okay so we're gonna do those two

470
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
okay so we're gonna do those two
 

471
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,230
okay so we're gonna do those two
attempts

472
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240

 

473
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,870

okay let's go now we go to the technique

474
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
okay let's go now we go to the technique
 

475
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,710
okay let's go now we go to the technique
but it's all the same

476
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
but it's all the same
 

477
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,750
but it's all the same
just keep the order but my wrist my

478
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
just keep the order but my wrist my
 

479
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,790
just keep the order but my wrist my
other hand

480
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
other hand
 

481
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,069
other hand
bone is going to find here but not

482
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
bone is going to find here but not
 

483
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,150
bone is going to find here but not
do this i'm not that's not how i'm

484
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
do this i'm not that's not how i'm
 

485
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,710
do this i'm not that's not how i'm
clearing it i'm going around his energy

486
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
clearing it i'm going around his energy
 

487
00:12:36,720 --> 00:13:04,829
clearing it i'm going around his energy
around again

488
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839

 

489
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:20,389

so

490
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399

 

491
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:44,990

this is something entirely different

492
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,000

 

493
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000

now
