00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
lift
 

175
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,189
lift
experience the turn

176

experience the turn
 

177
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,870
experience the turn

yes but i'm
 

183
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,510
yes but i'm
rooted here so i've got a connection

184
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
rooted here so i've got a connection
 

185
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,390
rooted here so i've got a connection
between

186
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
between
 

187
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,830
between
mass paul pulling my joe

188
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
mass paul pulling my joe
 

189
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,990
mass paul pulling my joe
so i'm expanding ex thinking that

190
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
so i'm expanding ex thinking that
 

191
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,990
so i'm expanding ex thinking that
and now i can bring paul's energy

192
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
and now i can bring paul's energy
 

193
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,670
and now i can bring paul's energy
over there to that i don't let this drop

194
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
over there to that i don't let this drop
 

195
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,749
over there to that i don't let this drop
and lose i keep it going

196
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
and lose i keep it going
 

197
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,790
and lose i keep it going
and then i bring it back in i bring this

198
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
and then i bring it back in i bring this
 

199
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,150
and then i bring it back in i bring this
energy

200
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
energy
 

201
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,189
energy
back in so i never lose the energy it's

202
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
back in so i never lose the energy it's
 

203
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,830
back in so i never lose the energy it's
a little bit like i'm on turbo boost

204
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
a little bit like i'm on turbo boost
 

205
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,350
a little bit like i'm on turbo boost
and i don't take my foot off the

206
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
and i don't take my foot off the
 

207
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,950
and i don't take my foot off the
throttle

208
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
throttle
 

209
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,430
throttle
so the moment i expand

210
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440

 

211
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,510

it doesn't die and that's what makes a

212
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
it doesn't die and that's what makes a
 

213
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,510
it doesn't die and that's what makes a
carter

214
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
carter
 

215
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,189
carter
rather

216
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199

 

217
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,990

so i think you can see it getting to

218
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
so i think you can see it getting to
 

219
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
so i think you can see it getting to
it's a different matter
