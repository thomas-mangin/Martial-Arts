229
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,469

okay so

230

it's
 

233
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,550
it's
it is very common that you hear or you

234
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
it is very common that you hear or you
 

235
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,950
it is very common that you hear or you
might even think that you know you're

236
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
might even think that you know you're
 

237
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,590
might even think that you know you're
the center of the technique

238
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
the center of the technique
 

239
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,029
the center of the technique
he's orbiting around you okay

240
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
he's orbiting around you okay
 

241
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,670
he's orbiting around you okay
then your mind goes oh

242
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
then your mind goes oh
 

243
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,430
then your mind goes oh
centrifugal energy but if you think

244
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
centrifugal energy but if you think
 

245
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,189
centrifugal energy but if you think
about an orbiting body like a planet

246
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
about an orbiting body like a planet
 

247
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,189
about an orbiting body like a planet
if it's only centrifugal energy it would

248
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
if it's only centrifugal energy it would
 

249
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,790
if it's only centrifugal energy it would
crash into it

250
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
crash into it
 

251
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,029
crash into it
there is some centripetal energy there's

252
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
there is some centripetal energy there's
 

253
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,830
there is some centripetal energy there's
some outward going force if you think in

254
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
some outward going force if you think in
 

255
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,749
some outward going force if you think in
terms of your yin and yang

256
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
terms of your yin and yang
 

257
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,749
terms of your yin and yang
i can't just be one

258
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
i can't just be one
 

259
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,909
i can't just be one
i have to do both okay so it can't be

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
he's going out with my tesla
 

277
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,550
he's going out with my tesla
okay do not pull him in the the body

278
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
okay do not pull him in the the body
 

279
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,589
okay do not pull him in the the body
where the footwork does the centripetal

280
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
where the footwork does the centripetal
 

281
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,830
where the footwork does the centripetal
okay this is keeping him out he tries to

282
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
okay this is keeping him out he tries to
 

283
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,870
okay this is keeping him out he tries to
come in he can't he's not coming in okay

284
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
come in he can't he's not coming in okay
 

285
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,350
come in he can't he's not coming in okay
he can't come in close to me he can't

286
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
he can't come in close to me he can't
 

287
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,990
he can't come in close to me he can't
close to me he can never close to me you

288
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
close to me he can never close to me you
 

289
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,469
close to me he can never close to me you
see i'm not going like this

290
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
see i'm not going like this
 

291
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,189
see i'm not going like this
he can't close to me whoa this is

292
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
he can't close to me whoa this is
 

293
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:23,589
he can't close to me whoa this is
keeping them out out

294
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599

 

295
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,270

okay so

296
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
okay so
 

297
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,670
okay so
even though you're picturing orbiting an

298
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
even though you're picturing orbiting an
 

299
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,189
even though you're picturing orbiting an
orbiting body

300
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
orbiting body
 

301
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,950
orbiting body
picture an orbiting body they're not

302
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
picture an orbiting body they're not
 

303
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,029
picture an orbiting body they're not
crashing in the planets are not crashing

304
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
crashing in the planets are not crashing
 

305
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,909
crashing in the planets are not crashing
into the sun okay there's some energy

306
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
into the sun okay there's some energy
 

307
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,550
into the sun okay there's some energy
that's keeping them out

308
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
that's keeping them out
 

309
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,870
that's keeping them out
next mistake

310
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
next mistake
 

311
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,270
next mistake
it won't do you any good if you get

312
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
it won't do you any good if you get
 

313
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,070
it won't do you any good if you get
yourself there and then you unlock his

314
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
yourself there and then you unlock his
 

315
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,869
yourself there and then you unlock his
body okay because then they can come in

316
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
body okay because then they can come in
 

317
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,390
body okay because then they can come in
and come in so i'm trying to do

318
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
and come in so i'm trying to do
 

319
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,110
and come in so i'm trying to do
the technique i'm trying to keep him out

320
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
the technique i'm trying to keep him out
 

321
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,670
the technique i'm trying to keep him out
it's outward energy okay and now i

322
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
it's outward energy okay and now i
 

323
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,150
it's outward energy okay and now i
unlock his body and he can pivot around

324
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
unlock his body and he can pivot around
 

325
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,270
unlock his body and he can pivot around
his shoulder he's not going to do

326
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
his shoulder he's not going to do
 

327
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,350
his shoulder he's not going to do
anything there's the strike

328
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360

 

329
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,909

so let's micro drill

330
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
so let's micro drill
 

331
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,670
so let's micro drill
the body lock will lighten the load okay

332
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
the body lock will lighten the load okay
 

333
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,350
the body lock will lighten the load okay
in the technique

334
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
in the technique
 

335
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,830
in the technique
i had to lock his body

336
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
i had to lock his body
 

337
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,589
i had to lock his body
through

338
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
through
 

339
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,990
through
that rotational energy here i just have

340
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
that rotational energy here i just have
 

341
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,869
that rotational energy here i just have
the mass of his body that's the energy i

342
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
the mass of his body that's the energy i
 

343
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,430
the mass of his body that's the energy i
gotta deal with so again what do i not

344
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
gotta deal with so again what do i not
 

345
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,550
gotta deal with so again what do i not
want

346
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
want
 

347
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,670
want
there's no free movement of his arm

348
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
