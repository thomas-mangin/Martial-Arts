1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
That's it

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,720
It's as simple as that.

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,480
You just witnessed two types of attack that are common occurance in large cities.

4
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,680
But here, the attackers were not lucky.

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,440
Their targets were Aikido practicioners,

6
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,280
a very efficient defense system.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,080
The term Aikido is probably new to most people. 

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,120
Aikido is not a sport, it is a martial art from Japan

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,400
The meaning of "Ai" is the union, "Ki" is the spirit, and "Do" is the path

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Here, physical strenght is secundary

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,600
Aikido is the way to tune one's spirit with that of others, and by extension, with the universe.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:30,520
Mr Clement, the representative of Aikido at the French Judo Federation tells us whether Aikido got implanted easily in France.

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:40,800
No. Aikido was first imported by Master Mochizuki [Minoru], who was a student of Master Ueshiba but who had modified the techniques.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Aikido really started with Master Tadashi Abe who taught the actual techniques that he had learned from Master Ueshiba.

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:06,320
When he returned to Japan, my friend Nocquet took over the leadership of the Aikido section at the Judo Federation.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Andre Nocquet, 50 years-old, propagator of Aikido in Europe, what is your exact title?

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm an Aikido Master.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
How did you become an Aikido Master?

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,520
I became an Aikido Master by travelling to Japan.

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,240
Before that you were a Judo instructor?

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,760
I was a Judo teacher

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,080
What did you do in Japan?

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:37,440
I practiced at the world Aikido headquarters under the founder, Master Ueshiba.

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,920
He is an extraordinary 86 years-old man with a face of a striking purity.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,840
He still lives in Tokyo in the dojo where he teaches this extraordinary discipline.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
Great Master, what is Aikido?

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:58,080
The spirit of Aikido is to foster love, it is the path of peace, the realisation of love.

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:08,560
There is good and bad love. Aikido conserves the good and we try to teach people to walk the right path.

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,640
Aikido has nothing to do with either Judo or religion.

30
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,920
Aikido is all inclusive and the goal is love.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,960
How long did you stay in Japan?

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,920
I stayed almost three years in his home.

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Learning Aikido.

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
Yes, learning Aikido under his direct guidance.

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
When you arrived in Tokyo, did you konw anything about Aikido?

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:42,080
I had studied it in France before under Master Tadashi Abe who had been sent to develop this discipline.

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,280
I got up every morning at 5 a.m. and cleaned the room with other Japanese disciples.

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
You have to clean the room.

39
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,920
You must clean before learning.

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,520
If you tried to ask people in France to clean the room before practice, it would not be possible.

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
What differenciates Judo from Aikido?

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Judo is a sport with prearranged forms.

43
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,120
Just like boxing or Greco-Roman wrestling where you have to observe a ritual.

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,840
Aikido is a very efficient defense system in the street, it works at mid-distance.

45
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,480
Can anybody do Aikido?

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,800
Anybody can practice Aikido, it is an excellent method for physical education and body coordination.

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
For children too?

48
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,680
Yes, it is a remarquable gymnastic for young people.

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,120
Do you think that Aikido brings something to mankind?

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, it brings a lot in terms of self control. During an attack, the reflex action comes into play, not the brain.

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,680
It is the concept of Zen buddhism that tells us to make the void and to let the instinct act.

52
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Why is Aikido less well known in Europe than Judo, Jujutsu or Karate?

53
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:34,920
It is normal, Aikido was a secret art 20 or 25 years ago but Master Ueshiba, the founder decided to open it up.

54
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,480
Why was it secret?

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,920
It was reserved to hgih rank people, the imperial police.

56
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Can Aikido be deadly?

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, just like words, we can say both good and bad things, it is the same thing.

58
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
More than 200 000 Japanese people practice Aikido

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,520
There are 30 000 practicioners in the united States where this art grows steadily, as well as in Europe with 18 000 enthusiasts.

60
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,200
by itself, France counts 4000 of them, from all classes of society.

61
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:32,440
Listen to a taxi driver, and then a woman, explain to you whay they practice Aikido.

62
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,560
How long have you been doing Aikido?

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
For two years.

64
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Why do you practice Aikido?

65
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:47,480
In my job, I am stuck in the car for many hours and although it is not physically tiring, I am very stressed because of traffic.

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:07:05,080
I feel that Aikido relaxes me, gives me good reflexes that I can use in traffic, and it could be a useful defense if I ever got attacked.

67
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,640
I practice Aikido because it is a very good physical exercise.

68
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:29,040
I have been doing it for 3 years and i have an interest for oriental philosophies so I like to study the like between Aikido and Zen.

69
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm an office worker and i have been practicing for 12 years, I am 3rd Dan.

70
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:49,440
I practice because it is an intelligent physical exercise that complements well my sedentary lifestyle and that satisfies both my body and my spirit.

71
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,680
I have been doing it for a year and it is good for me because it doesn't require strenght.

72
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm a photographer and i live in the suburbs so I soemtimes come home late at night so Aikido provides me with an efficient means of defense is needed.

73
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,120
Japan has several military arts

74
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Some use weapons like Kendo, the Japanese fencing, or Kyudo, the archery.

75
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:36,400
Others like judo or Karate do not use them and Aikido could be put in that category if it did not use the same principles for empty-handed techniques and weapons practice.

76
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:47,360
During his youth, Master Ueshiba studied all of the martial arts and he never ceased daily the intense daily practice of these many techniques,

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:57,120
which allowed him to create Aikido, the synthesis of all known Asian self-defense systems based of his tireless study.

78
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:16,880
To the profane, Aikido techniques seem extraodrinarily fast and precise but the numerous applications only become efficient after several years of training.

79
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:26,440
Beginners have to learn to move around their adversary at angles from 180 to 360 degrees without loosing their balance.

80
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,480
On a physical aspect, Aikido movements can be compared to that of a pendulum 

81
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,600
and the attacker will find himself directed into a circular motion, until  he loses the control of his agrssive gestures,

82
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:47,280
which prevents him to make use of his flexor or extensor muscles, the only means of action of a human being.

83
00:09:50,360 --> 00:10:02,000
Aikido's fundamental principles do not aim at break of strain joints, but to bend them in their natural axis of action until their limit.

84
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,880
This localized pain leads to a loss of balance.

85
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:25,360
The art of falling is different to that of Judo and the Aikido practicioner immediately gets up after the projection by graciously rolling over the wrist, the elbow, or the shoulder.

86
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,640
This provides an escape route from a painful lock, 

87
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,160
to avoir injury due to the contact of the ground on a vital point, 

88
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,400
to recover one's balance, and to get up in order to face the adversary again.

89
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Because of its soft style, Aikido is the most approppriate personnal defense for women and older men.

90
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,520
Thos who choose this discipline can practice over a whole lifetime and keep improving, regardless of the age.

91
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Abotu the typical Japanese uniform, the top is similar to that of Judo

92
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:11,760
and the black trousers are used to hide the all important footwork from the adversary.

93
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,320
To conclude this demonstration presented by Andre Nocquet and his student, Jean-Daniel Cauhepe,

94
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,800
demonstration that speaks for itself in terms of their efficacy whatever the number of attackers.

95
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,760
Let's give the final word to Master Ueshiba, the founder of this martial art where the spirit always wins over brutal stenght.

96
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
Master ueshiba says:

97
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,360
"I created Aikido so that all bodies and spirits are healthy. I did so so that the entire world can be one and i rejoice of it."

98
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,960
May he be heard in our tormented world.
