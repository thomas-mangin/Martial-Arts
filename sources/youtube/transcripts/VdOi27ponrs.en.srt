1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,099

back to that incentive truth principle

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:07,109
back to that incentive truth principle
 

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,799
back to that incentive truth principle
so what's happening outside which means

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:09,809
so what's happening outside which means
 

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,509
so what's happening outside which means
me and I needs to be happening inside as

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:14,519
me and I needs to be happening inside as
 

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,670
me and I needs to be happening inside as
well so when he pushes I am NOT going

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
well so when he pushes I am NOT going
 

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,859
well so when he pushes I am NOT going
Yong Yong inside too I don't have the

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:27,869
Yong Yong inside too I don't have the
 

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,890
Yong Yong inside too I don't have the
mind of throwing young please go so I

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:30,900
mind of throwing young please go so I
 

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,470
mind of throwing young please go so I
just really relaxed everything is

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
just really relaxed everything is
 

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,250
just really relaxed everything is
relaxed

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:34,260
relaxed
 

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,370
relaxed
and I met zero I'm gonna call it a zero

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:37,380
and I met zero I'm gonna call it a zero
 

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,680
and I met zero I'm gonna call it a zero
meaning I'm not on the young side and

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:39,690
meaning I'm not on the young side and
 

21
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,970
meaning I'm not on the young side and
I'm not on the inside okay and that will

22
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:43,980
I'm not on the inside okay and that will
 

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,619
I'm not on the inside okay and that will
happen in the in the entire technique so

24
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:47,629
happen in the in the entire technique so
 

25
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:54,380
happen in the in the entire technique so
as you can see if I go plus then you can

26
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,390
as you can see if I go plus then you can
 

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,430
as you can see if I go plus then you can
see that I have this Center while I'm at

28
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
see that I have this Center while I'm at
 

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,399
see that I have this Center while I'm at
zero I'm not not in his center I have

30
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:04,409
zero I'm not not in his center I have
 

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,830
zero I'm not not in his center I have
I'm right there on the surface of his

32
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:06,840
I'm right there on the surface of his
 

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm right there on the surface of his
Center so you can't control you can't

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,330
Center so you can't control you can't
 

35
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,730
Center so you can't control you can't
control him you see as I'm bowing it's

36
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:13,740
control him you see as I'm bowing it's
 

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,340
control him you see as I'm bowing it's
making my hand travel forward in the

38
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,350
making my hand travel forward in the
 

39
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,219
making my hand travel forward in the
sagittal plane okay and then whole

40
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,229
sagittal plane okay and then whole
 

41
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,960
sagittal plane okay and then whole
technique is like that so inside relaxed

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:22,970
technique is like that so inside relaxed
 

43
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,020
technique is like that so inside relaxed
if I start to move over here you can

44
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,030
if I start to move over here you can
 

45
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,310
if I start to move over here you can
still have this Center you see

46
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
still have this Center you see
 

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,440
still have this Center you see
I still have hey as as I come up I still

48
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,450
I still have hey as as I come up I still
 

49
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,500
I still have hey as as I come up I still
have this scent still have it come up I

50
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:41,510
have this scent still have it come up I
 

51
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,800
have this scent still have it come up I
still have it still happened and that's

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:44,810
still have it still happened and that's
 

53
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:53,290
still have it still happened and that's
what I did it take me so it looks like

54
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:53,300
what I did it take me so it looks like
 

55
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,860
what I did it take me so it looks like
it's all very Hin you see my dad totally

56
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:56,870
it's all very Hin you see my dad totally
 

57
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,719
it's all very Hin you see my dad totally
feels it differently because I don't

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:58,729
feels it differently because I don't
 

59
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,310
feels it differently because I don't
have this okay but it can't be I don't

60
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,320
have this okay but it can't be I don't
 

61
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,560
have this okay but it can't be I don't
want to push by how he's demonstrated

62
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,570
want to push by how he's demonstrated
 

63
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,040
want to push by how he's demonstrated
yeah it's it's all at that neutral so we

64
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,050
yeah it's it's all at that neutral so we
 

65
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,900
yeah it's it's all at that neutral so we
we do it the other way so he he tries to

66
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:13,910
we do it the other way so he he tries to
 

67
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,020
we do it the other way so he he tries to
go to us and if I stop here you can see

68
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,030
go to us and if I stop here you can see
 

69
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,370
go to us and if I stop here you can see
that he can't go past that I was in the

70
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,380
that he can't go past that I was in the
 

71
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,460
that he can't go past that I was in the
negative side he pushed through so I'm

72
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,470
negative side he pushed through so I'm
 

73
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,150
negative side he pushed through so I'm
doing the technique he can't compromise

74
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
doing the technique he can't compromise
 

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,229
doing the technique he can't compromise
that same thing as I come here and he

76
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
that same thing as I come here and he
 

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,930
that same thing as I come here and he
pushes he can't compromise that as I

78
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:34,940
pushes he can't compromise that as I
 

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:43,270
pushes he can't compromise that as I
trade push it you can't compromise so

80
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
trade push it you can't compromise so
 

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,300
trade push it you can't compromise so
I'm not negative I'm not plus I do this

82
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,310
I'm not negative I'm not plus I do this
 

83
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,539
I'm not negative I'm not plus I do this
same tip the same technique same exact

84
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:49,549
same tip the same technique same exact
 

85
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:57,460
same tip the same technique same exact
way so you know let's do it as a spot

86
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,470
way so you know let's do it as a spot
 

87
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,130
way so you know let's do it as a spot
test let's starts do the positives spot

88
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,140
test let's starts do the positives spot
 

89
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,789
test let's starts do the positives spot
test you see so I'll check here right

90
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:03,799
test you see so I'll check here right
 

91
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,030
test you see so I'll check here right
I'll check here I'll check here I'll

92
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,040
I'll check here I'll check here I'll
 

93
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,460
I'll check here I'll check here I'll
check here

94
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,470

 

95
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,949

they would do the negative check so he's

96
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
they would do the negative check so he's
 

97
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,490
they would do the negative check so he's
trying to push and push he's trying to

98
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:22,500
trying to push and push he's trying to
 

99
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,199
trying to push and push he's trying to

00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,209
push push
 

101
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,949
push push
he's trying to push I can't push my

102
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:27,959
he's trying to push I can't push my
 

103
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,920
he's trying to push I can't push my
English you can't push he's trying to

104
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:30,930
English you can't push he's trying to
 

105
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,300
English you can't push he's trying to
push you can't push and do you

106
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,310
push you can't push and do you
 

107
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,509
push you can't push and do you
understand does it who can understand

108
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
understand does it who can understand
 

109
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,410
understand does it who can understand
the to test

110
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:39,420
the to test
 

111
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:47,120
the to test
okay let's what we're going to try to do

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,130
okay let's what we're going to try to do
 

113
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,640
okay let's what we're going to try to do
is give us more metrics so you can see

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,650
is give us more metrics so you can see
 

115
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:01,570
is give us more metrics so you can see
if we're doing so

116
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,580

 

117
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,510

okay seven he'll feel around as I'm

118
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,520
okay seven he'll feel around as I'm
 

119
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,140
okay seven he'll feel around as I'm
doing the tech mush you see how it's

120
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,150
doing the tech mush you see how it's
 

121
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,880
doing the tech mush you see how it's
it's mushy okay

122
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:12,890
it's mushy okay
 

123
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,420
it's mushy okay
then come to the front though and he's

124
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,430
then come to the front though and he's
 

125
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,970
then come to the front though and he's
pushing here and just feel it's mushy

126
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:21,980
pushing here and just feel it's mushy
 

127
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,960
pushing here and just feel it's mushy
right okay but you can push you see and

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:28,970
right okay but you can push you see and
 

129
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,120
right okay but you can push you see and
I'm doing that so mushy mushy but stable

130
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,130
I'm doing that so mushy mushy but stable
 

131
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm doing that so mushy mushy but stable
okay so as I go to the technique is

132
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,690
okay so as I go to the technique is
 

133
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,170
okay so as I go to the technique is
still mushy but it's stable

134
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,180
still mushy but it's stable
 

135
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,200
still mushy but it's stable
okay I'm over here on you and you must

136
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,210
okay I'm over here on you and you must
 

137
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,810
okay I'm over here on you and you must
do the negative test so he's pushing on

138
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:49,820
do the negative test so he's pushing on
 

139
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,980
do the negative test so he's pushing on
me but mushy but stable

140
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:53,990
me but mushy but stable
 

141
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,690
me but mushy but stable
okay I go as I stand up you're still

142

okay I go as I stand up you're still
 

143
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:09,250
okay I go as I stand up you're still
there right still mushy because it's

144
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,260
there right still mushy because it's
 

145
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,700
there right still mushy because it's
easy to go like this you come around and

146
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,710
easy to go like this you come around and
 

147
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:22,900
easy to go like this you come around and
you feel around right okay everything is

148
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:22,910
you feel around right okay everything is
 

149
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,300
you feel around right okay everything is
super intense you're trying to do this

150
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,310
super intense you're trying to do this
 

151
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,110
super intense you're trying to do this
stuff

152
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
stuff
 

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,090
stuff
so I have positional integrity but I and

154
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,100
so I have positional integrity but I and
 

155
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,150
so I have positional integrity but I and
I have sent a connection but nothing is

156
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
I have sent a connection but nothing is
 

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:50,270
I have sent a connection but nothing is
is tensed okay we'll have we'll go in

158
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,280
is tensed okay we'll have we'll go in
 

159
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,379
is tensed okay we'll have we'll go in
threes and your person will third person

160
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:54,389
threes and your person will third person
 

161
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,180
threes and your person will third person
is gonna come around and feel a few

162
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,190
is gonna come around and feel a few
 

163
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,550
is gonna come around and feel a few
they're doing it and press test on

164
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,560
they're doing it and press test on
 

165
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,600
they're doing it and press test on
something that's you things not exactly

166
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,610
something that's you things not exactly
 

167
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,700
something that's you things not exactly
like the other side of your body do you

168
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:07,710
like the other side of your body do you
 

169
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,700
like the other side of your body do you
get that because what what I'm seeing is

170
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,710
get that because what what I'm seeing is
 

171
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,730
get that because what what I'm seeing is
as you go like you right now this arm is

172
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:13,740
as you go like you right now this arm is
 

173
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,570
as you go like you right now this arm is
totally not doing it and you now it'll

174
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:17,580
totally not doing it and you now it'll
 

175
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,129
totally not doing it and you now it'll
start again do you see that so you're

176
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
start again do you see that so you're
 

177
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,100
start again do you see that so you're
gonna do both third person let's see

178
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,110
gonna do both third person let's see
 

179
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,870
gonna do both third person let's see
what's tense and then press check that

180
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:29,880
what's tense and then press check that
 

181
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,300
what's tense and then press check that
other part that they think is not in it

182
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,310
other part that they think is not in it
 

183
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:39,620
other part that they think is not in it
at any point so let's say when my when

184
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:39,630
at any point so let's say when my when
 

185
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,110
at any point so let's say when my when
my arm this is where I see a lot and so

186
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,120
my arm this is where I see a lot and so
 

187
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
my arm this is where I see a lot and so
he he's pushing the he's pushing on me

188
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,370
he he's pushing the he's pushing on me
 

189
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,690
he he's pushing the he's pushing on me
right so if I let called that energy you

190
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:47,700
right so if I let called that energy you
 

191
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,960
right so if I let called that energy you
can see he's trying to knock me down can

192
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:50,970
can see he's trying to knock me down can
 

193
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,330
can see he's trying to knock me down can
you try to knock me down okay that's

194
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,340
you try to knock me down okay that's
 

195
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,120
you try to knock me down okay that's
fine

196
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,130

 

197
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,210

and when you guys break this arm this

198
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,220
and when you guys break this arm this
 

199
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,720
and when you guys break this arm this
arm is like nah you're not doing it

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:04,730
arm is like nah you're not doing it
 

201
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,350
arm is like nah you're not doing it
inside so if you come around and you

202
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,360
inside so if you come around and you
 

203
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,460
inside so if you come around and you
have like a wrist grab yeah you see and

204
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:12,470
have like a wrist grab yeah you see and
 

205
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,200
have like a wrist grab yeah you see and
if she's pushing you can't you wouldn't

206
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,210
if she's pushing you can't you wouldn't
 

207
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,580
if she's pushing you can't you wouldn't
be able to hit that arm lift

208
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,590
be able to hit that arm lift
 

209
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,470
be able to hit that arm lift
do you understand but as I'm going to be

210
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:19,480
do you understand but as I'm going to be
 

211
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,870
do you understand but as I'm going to be
using I mean do you guys have parts of

212
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
using I mean do you guys have parts of
 

213
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,350
using I mean do you guys have parts of
your body that's not working and as a

214
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,360
your body that's not working and as a
 

215
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,860
your body that's not working and as a
result you aren't actually doing young

216
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:29,870
result you aren't actually doing young
 

217
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,920
result you aren't actually doing young
beyond because internally you don't have

218
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:34,930
beyond because internally you don't have
 

219
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,620
beyond because internally you don't have
the yen in the Yong record side you see

220
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:38,630
the yen in the Yong record side you see
 

221
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,260
the yen in the Yong record side you see
that and so because you're doing you're

222
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,270
that and so because you're doing you're
 

223
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,840
that and so because you're doing you're
doing young too young by default of the

224
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:43,850
doing young too young by default of the
 

225
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,580
doing young too young by default of the
other hand being way to him then this

226
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:48,590
other hand being way to him then this
 

227
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,070
other hand being way to him then this
time we go wait on that's how you're

228
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,080
time we go wait on that's how you're
 

229
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,320
time we go wait on that's how you're
doing the technique but as you can see

230
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,330
doing the technique but as you can see
 

231
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,250
doing the technique but as you can see
if you can't stop that half the movie in

232
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,260
if you can't stop that half the movie in
 

233
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,050
if you can't stop that half the movie in
the same way that he can't make that

234
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,060
the same way that he can't make that
 

235
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,560
the same way that he can't make that
mark go back okay it's gonna be a

236
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,570
mark go back okay it's gonna be a
 

237
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,150
mark go back okay it's gonna be a
relaxed reconcile getting young

238
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
relaxed reconcile getting young
 

239
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,270
relaxed reconcile getting young
externally internally as well okay so

240
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
externally internally as well okay so
 

241
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,340
externally internally as well okay so
the first third person press check on

242
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,350
the first third person press check on
 

243
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,140
the first third person press check on
those things you should be able to see

244
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,150
those things you should be able to see
 

245
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,450
those things you should be able to see
where yeah that's totally not like the

246
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:16,460
where yeah that's totally not like the
 

247
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,340
where yeah that's totally not like the
other arm you should see the difference

248
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,350

 

249
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:31,260

that silly

250
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,270

 

251
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,850

as a purpose so I have to orient it

252
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:35,860
as a purpose so I have to orient it
 

253
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,959
as a purpose so I have to orient it
towards an aim I can't either

254
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:39,969
towards an aim I can't either
 

255
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,930
towards an aim I can't either
I'm not just trying to develop it in

256
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm not just trying to develop it in
 

257
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm not just trying to develop it in
myself okay I do need to do that but I

258
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,070
myself okay I do need to do that but I
 

259
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,720
myself okay I do need to do that but I
want to have a purpose to it in this

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,730
want to have a purpose to it in this
 

261
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,870
want to have a purpose to it in this
okay and the one that is now a living

262
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
okay and the one that is now a living
 

263
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,620
okay and the one that is now a living
you is that you you don't have the

264
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:58,630
you is that you you don't have the
 

265
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,530
you is that you you don't have the
center connection your you're not sure

266
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,540
center connection your you're not sure
 

267
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,030
center connection your you're not sure
how to get it it's really easy and

268
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
how to get it it's really easy and
 

269
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,780
how to get it it's really easy and
different you get themselves have a

270
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:09,790
different you get themselves have a
 

271
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,840
different you get themselves have a
different skill level of connecting

272
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:12,850
different skill level of connecting
 

273
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,470
different skill level of connecting
their Center into their arm so for

274
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
their Center into their arm so for
 

275
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,320
their Center into their arm so for
example if I have a bouquet who is doing

276
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,330
example if I have a bouquet who is doing
 

277
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,010
example if I have a bouquet who is doing
the in pressure testing right from their

278
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,020
the in pressure testing right from their
 

279
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,940
the in pressure testing right from their
Center

280
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:26,950
Center
 

281
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,320
Center
I will automatically by default find

282
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,330
I will automatically by default find
 

283
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,690
I will automatically by default find
their Center simply by staying connected

284
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:33,700
their Center simply by staying connected
 

285
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,730
their Center simply by staying connected
to the risk as they put their Center

286
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:35,740
to the risk as they put their Center
 

287
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,460
to the risk as they put their Center
into that but as it as you have

288
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,470
into that but as it as you have
 

289
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,860
into that but as it as you have
different you get so that became who's

290
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:40,870
different you get so that became who's
 

291
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,380
different you get so that became who's
like pushing only at the shoulder I have

292
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,390
like pushing only at the shoulder I have
 

293
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,370
like pushing only at the shoulder I have
to still be able to find a center and

294
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,380
to still be able to find a center and
 

295
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,730
to still be able to find a center and
that becomes a more of a task where even

296
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:50,740
that becomes a more of a task where even
 

297
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,940
that becomes a more of a task where even
decent okay who can do it here will now

298
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,950
decent okay who can do it here will now
 

299
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,190
decent okay who can do it here will now
start preserving themselves and

300
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,200
start preserving themselves and
 

301
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,690
start preserving themselves and
withdrawing from the prescribed energy

302
00:09:59,690 --> 00:09:59,700
withdrawing from the prescribed energy
 

303
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,210
withdrawing from the prescribed energy
that Luca is assigned to so there there

304
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,220
that Luca is assigned to so there there
 

305
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,610
that Luca is assigned to so there there
are their centers not in there are many

306
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:05,620
are their centers not in there are many
 

307
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,520
are their centers not in there are many
more do you see that so you can't just

308
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,530
more do you see that so you can't just
 

309
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,120
more do you see that so you can't just
push on the arm it'll do that you have

310
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,130
push on the arm it'll do that you have
 

311
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,340
push on the arm it'll do that you have
to be able to still find the center to

312
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,350
to be able to still find the center to
 

313
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,140
to be able to still find the center to
see how I'm doing that and the same

314
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,150
see how I'm doing that and the same
 

315
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,220
see how I'm doing that and the same
thing goes especially here like if I

316
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,230
thing goes especially here like if I
 

317
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,020
thing goes especially here like if I
just push on his arm to arm will

318
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,030
just push on his arm to arm will
 

319
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,200
just push on his arm to arm will
collapse so even as the arm is collapsed

320
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,210
collapse so even as the arm is collapsed
 

321
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,150
collapse so even as the arm is collapsed
and I still have to find the center and

322
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,160
and I still have to find the center and
 

323
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,449
and I still have to find the center and
this is where most

324
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:29,459
this is where most
 

325
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,460
this is where most
that still have a reference out of fear

326
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,470

they take completely out of their
harmony yeah and so you're throwing and

330
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:37,499
harmony yeah and so you're throwing and
 

331
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:42,079
harmony yeah and so you're throwing and
you don't have near Ohio Center so it

332
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,089
you don't have near Ohio Center so it
 

333
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,720

can I can I find his Center from

486
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:25,510
can I can I find his Center from
 

487
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,980
can I can I find his Center from
wherever I'm touching him do you get

488
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:28,990
wherever I'm touching him do you get
 

489
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,860
wherever I'm touching him do you get
that okay so he's loose I have to be

490
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:34,870
that okay so he's loose I have to be
 

491
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,830
that okay so he's loose I have to be
able to find his Center

492
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:36,840
able to find his Center
 

493

497
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,319

okay all right so now this raises the

498
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:49,329
okay all right so now this raises the
 

499
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,429
okay all right so now this raises the
question that that who can you'll feel

500
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:53,439
question that that who can you'll feel
 

501
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,929
question that that who can you'll feel

the lip do as if you fell okay
 

503
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,449
the lip do as if you fell okay
why do I say it's a nice level skill is

504
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:00,459
why do I say it's a nice level skill is
 

505
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,439
why do I say it's a nice level skill is
because I am the active agent in the

relationships that you need to get his
 

521
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,030
relationships that you need to get his
center would be together and you I can't
