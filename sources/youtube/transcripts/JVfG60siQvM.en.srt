1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,990

You got to come over the top.

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
You got to come over the top.
 

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,910

Keep them moving over the top. Enter.
 

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,349
Keep them moving over the top. Enter.
You get one step in behind them and then

6
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
You get one step in behind them and then
 

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:01:05,590
You get one step in behind them and then
the other foot.

8
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600

 

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:20,550

One step.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560

 

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:30,550

Come this way.

12
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560

 

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,469

Okay,

14
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
Okay,

Okay,
Chris,

16
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680

 

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,429

did you see that extra step you took?

18
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
did you see that extra step you took?
 

19
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,149
did you see that extra step you took?
Yeah. Okay. So, I wasn't even touching

20
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
Yeah. Okay. So, I wasn't even touching
 

21
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,710
Yeah. Okay. So, I wasn't even touching
him when we took that step. And we're We

22
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
him when we took that step. And we're We
 

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,030
him when we took that step. And we're We
don't do that. So, we're used to I was

24
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
don't do that. So, we're used to I was
 

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,590
don't do that. So, we're used to I was
supposed to go around my no, but we

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
supposed to go around my no, but we
 

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,830
supposed to go around my no, but we
don't do that. Okay. All All you do is

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
don't do that. Okay. All All you do is
 

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,789
don't do that. Okay. All All you do is
you keep the initial movement. Okay. So,

30
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
you keep the initial movement. Okay. So,
 

31
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:13,350
you keep the initial movement. Okay. So,
try it again.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360

 

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:33,190

Always

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200

 

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,830

releasing tension, feeling their center,

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
releasing tension, feeling their center,
 

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,589
releasing tension, feeling their center,
moving their center, obeying the

38
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
moving their center, obeying the
 

39
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,270
moving their center, obeying the
yin-yang grid,

40
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280

 

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,270

spiral rotating the whole pairing.

42
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280

 

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,229

You You got to get used to this, Angela.

44
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
You You got to get used to this, Angela.
 

45
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,949
You You got to get used to this, Angela.
Yeah. We're not entering past them. We

46
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
Yeah. We're not entering past them. We
 

47
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,509
Yeah. We're not entering past them. We
enter around them.

48
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519

 

49
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:12,869

Change partners.

00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879

 

51
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,949

And then Nag decides when you get out of

52
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
And then Nag decides when you get out of
 

53
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:24,229
And then Nag decides when you get out of
the technique again.

54
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239

 

55
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,750

Try to keep it moving.

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760

 

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,670

Keep them moving. Keep them moving. You

58
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
Keep them moving. Keep them moving. You
 

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,630
Keep them moving. Keep them moving. You
lady got to obey the yinyang rules on

60
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
lady got to obey the yinyang rules on
 

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:46,630
lady got to obey the yinyang rules on
the grid.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640

 

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,229

Get to that back like you were going to

64
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
Get to that back like you were going to
 

65
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,789
Get to that back like you were going to
choke him. Think about that.

66
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
choke him. Think about that.
 

67
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,710
choke him. Think about that.
See, he's got to get past you.

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720

got to load everything properly the

104
00:34:59,910 --> 00:34:59,920
got to load everything properly the
 

105
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:09,349
got to load everything properly the
whole time.

106
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359

 

107
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,150

bring it in there more.

108
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160

 

109
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,150

I I would do the same thing. Try to keep

110
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
I I would do the same thing. Try to keep
 

111
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:30,390
I I would do the same thing. Try to keep
bringing it around until

112
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400

 

113
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:42,069

nice and

115
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,750

So as as you as you watch me in the

116
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
So as as you as you watch me in the
 

117
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,710
So as as you as you watch me in the
technique even even at this low level

118
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
technique even even at this low level
 

119
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,630
technique even even at this low level
um I am some of you come here you see

120
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
um I am some of you come here you see
 

121
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,870
um I am some of you come here you see
I'm not here

122
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
I'm not here
 

123
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,870
I'm not here
doing these things or anything because

124
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
doing these things or anything because
 

125
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,430
doing these things or anything because
that that that might not be it you know

126
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
that that that might not be it you know
 

127
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,390
that that that might not be it you know
what I

128
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
what I
 

129
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,790
what I
and they kind of slump down like that. I

130
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
and they kind of slump down like that. I
 

131
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,310
and they kind of slump down like that. I
have to come around and hit them in the

132
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
have to come around and hit them in the
 

133
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,470
have to come around and hit them in the
face because they sat up on them on the

134
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
face because they sat up on them on the
 

135
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,790
face because they sat up on them on the
technique. Okay, so it's not a one and

136
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
technique. Okay, so it's not a one and
 

137
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,310
technique. Okay, so it's not a one and
done where I have to just do that. And

138
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
done where I have to just do that. And
 

139
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,030
done where I have to just do that. And
if I task myself with the ground vector,

140
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,040
if I task myself with the ground vector,
 

141
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,829
if I task myself with the ground vector,
I'll always

142
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
I'll always
 

143
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,829
I'll always
clean up the last stance. Hang out there

144
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:19,839
clean up the last stance. Hang out there
 

145
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:31,990
clean up the last stance. Hang out there
for a while.

146
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000

 

147
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,230

That's where that was filling up.

148
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240

 

149
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,630

Yes.

150
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640

 

151

154
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
I'm kidding. How you feel?
 

155
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,230
I'm kidding. How you feel?
I'm trying to

156
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240

 

157
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,950

Yes. Yes.

161
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,790

You got to find the space and not create

162
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
You got to find the space and not create
 

163
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,270
You got to find the space and not create
yawn.

164
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
yawn.
 

165
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,510
yawn.
Okay. So, for those who the footwork,

166
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
Okay. So, for those who the footwork,
 

167
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,790
Okay. So, for those who the footwork,
we've missed it long enough.

168
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
we've missed it long enough.
 

169
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,230
we've missed it long enough.
It's basically like if I go here,

170
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
It's basically like if I go here,
 

171
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,109
It's basically like if I go here,
you see it's

172
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:31,119
you see it's
 

173
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,190

when I'm when I'm pushing here. I'm push

518
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
when I'm when I'm pushing here. I'm push
 

519
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,589
when I'm when I'm pushing here. I'm push
in the center.

520
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
in the center.
 

521
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,390
in the center.
Likewise, I can I can push over here.

522
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
Likewise, I can I can push over here.
 

523
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,950
Likewise, I can I can push over here.
That's incorrect. I move the center.

524
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
That's incorrect. I move the center.
 

525
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,950
That's incorrect. I move the center.
That's what I'm doing. It's just being

526
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
That's what I'm doing. It's just being
 

527
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,470
That's what I'm doing. It's just being
done with here. But I can also add by

528
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
done with here. But I can also add by
 

529
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,549
done with here. But I can also add by
I'm going to lift the center ever so

530
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
I'm going to lift the center ever so
 

531
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,829
I'm going to lift the center ever so
slightly. So, not this direction, but

532
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
slightly. So, not this direction, but
 

533
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,790
slightly. So, not this direction, but
the friction is up. That little bit is

534
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,800
the friction is up. That little bit is
 

535
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,549
the friction is up. That little bit is
in the technique. Okay. So, this arm is

536
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
in the technique. Okay. So, this arm is
 

537
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,829
in the technique. Okay. So, this arm is
there.

538
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839

and between the two legs and all this

540
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319

541
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,790

set that's going to be here. You get him

542
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:16,800
set that's going to be here. You get him
 

543
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,870
set that's going to be here. You get him
in what I call the body triangle. He's

544
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:18,880
in what I call the body triangle. He's
 

545
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,430
in what I call the body triangle. He's
trying to fall out of it and I just have

546
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
trying to fall out of it and I just have
 

547
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,670
trying to fall out of it and I just have
to keep it. So there's our stay. Okay.

548
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
to keep it. So there's our stay. Okay.
 

549
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,069
to keep it. So there's our stay. Okay.
Stay where you are. And you'll feel that

550
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
Stay where you are. And you'll feel that
 

551
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,270
Stay where you are. And you'll feel that
there's a kind of kind of resistance

552
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
there's a kind of kind of resistance
 

553
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,829
there's a kind of kind of resistance
towards trying to get out. So if I'm

554
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
towards trying to get out. So if I'm
 

555
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,829
towards trying to get out. So if I'm
here, you can slide out.

556
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
here, you can slide out.
 

557
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,910
here, you can slide out.
I'm here like this. I match these these

558
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
I'm here like this. I match these these

561
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,829

There's a little resistance to that and

562
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:43,839
There's a little resistance to that and
 

563
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,710
There's a little resistance to that and
that's what is being used to throw him.

564

you keep that friction the whole way

578
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
you keep that friction the whole way
 

579
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,790
you keep that friction the whole way
down. They fall out of it. Not you open

580
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:24,800

581
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,510

583
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,829

Yes.

584
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839

 

585
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,150

Yes. Much better.

586
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,160

 

587
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:47,030

Two independent forces

588
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040

 

589
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:55,190

energy came out that way

590
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200

 

591
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,030

592
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040

 

593
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:11,190

feel the lateral friction. Yes.

594
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,200

 

595
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,349

So here is that there's no way you can

596
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
So here is that there's no way you can
 

597
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,630
So here is that there's no way you can
do this with your arm staying still.

598
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:18,640
do this with your arm staying still.
 

599
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,390
do this with your arm staying still.
You see because as as this gets

600
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
You see because as as this gets
 

601
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,470
You see because as as this gets
displaced, this has to keep a fine

602
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
displaced, this has to keep a fine
 

603
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,230
displaced, this has to keep a fine
pressure so that you get that that body

604
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
pressure so that you get that that body
 

605
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,030
pressure so that you get that that body
triangle. Okay. So here it's clearly

606
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
triangle. Okay. So here it's clearly
 

607
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,870
triangle. Okay. So here it's clearly
off. You can go out that way. Go out

608
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
off. You can go out that way. Go out

back in. I get these pressures there.

612
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,880
back in. I get these pressures there.
 

613
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,030
back in. I get these pressures there.
You feel a little friction there, but

614
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,040
You feel a little friction there, but
 

615
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,190
You feel a little friction there, but
that tells me that I I have the center.

616
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
that tells me that I I have the center.
 

617
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,150
that tells me that I I have the center.
And I'll keep moving these forces ever

618
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
And I'll keep moving these forces ever
 

619
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,390
And I'll keep moving these forces ever
so slowly.

620
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
so slowly.
 

621
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,309
so slowly.

Arm has to keep moving.
 

645
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,990
Arm has to keep moving.
Your arm has to go back. Yes.

646
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
Your arm has to go back. Yes.
 

647
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,990
Your arm has to go back. Yes.
Cuz he's going to rotate around you.

1005
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,709
This this is the way that I understand
what I'm doing is I do get that you can

1006
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:02,719
what I'm doing is I do get that you can
 

1007
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,870
what I'm doing is I do get that you can
use the inertia itself as your fulcrum.

1008
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:06,880
use the inertia itself as your fulcrum.
 

1009
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,110
use the inertia itself as your fulcrum.
Okay. And then the centrifugal force

1010
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
Okay. And then the centrifugal force
 

1011
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,189
Okay. And then the centrifugal force
will be your lever. I get that. Okay. Um

1012
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
will be your lever. I get that. Okay. Um
 

1013
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:17,750
will be your lever. I get that. Okay. Um
but again my experience is

1014
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
but again my experience is
 

1015
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,709
but again my experience is
I'm going to use that and then have a

1016
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:20,719
I'm going to use that and then have a
 

1017
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:23,189
I'm going to use that and then have a
redundancy to the architecture and

1018
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
redundancy to the architecture and
 

1019
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,110
redundancy to the architecture and
that's where the base displacement comes

1020
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
that's where the base displacement comes

When we introduce that though then
 

1025

When we introduce that though then
people stop using the inertia and the

01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
people stop using the inertia and the
 

1027
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,550
people stop using the inertia and the
centrifugal energy and when you do that

1028
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
centrifugal energy and when you do that
 

1029
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,350
centrifugal energy and when you do that
then this material lever fulcrum

1030
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
then this material lever fulcrum
 

1031
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,189
then this material lever fulcrum
requires a lot more strength. Okay. Um,

01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:43,199
requires a lot more strength. Okay. Um,
 

1033
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,630
requires a lot more strength. Okay. Um,
I bet it is not captured on the video,

1034
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
I bet it is not captured on the video,
 

1035
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,430
I bet it is not captured on the video,
but that last wrap rep, if you were

1036
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
but that last wrap rep, if you were
 

1037
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,189
but that last wrap rep, if you were
aware,

1038
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:51,199
aware,
 

1039
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,310
aware,
you barely bumped his leg and it was

1040
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
you barely bumped his leg and it was
 

1041
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,669
you barely bumped his leg and it was
actually even low on his leg, not in

1042
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
actually even low on his leg, not in
 

1043
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,550
actually even low on his leg, not in
where we were practicing it. And that is

1044
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
where we were practicing it. And that is
 

1045
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,709
where we were practicing it. And that is
what that's my experience. That's quite

1046
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719
what that's my experience. That's quite
 

1047
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,270
what that's my experience. That's quite
common. As long as everything else is

1048
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280
common. As long as everything else is
 

1049
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,390
common. As long as everything else is
there, you can almost brush the material

1050
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,400
there, you can almost brush the material
 

1051
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,310
there, you can almost brush the material
fulcrum, right? the basis and it it's

1052
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
fulcrum, right? the basis and it it's
 

1053
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,390
fulcrum, right? the basis and it it's
good to go because it was already good

1054
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
good to go because it was already good
 

1055
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,270
good to go because it was already good
to go with the centrifugal energy and

1056
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
to go with the centrifugal energy and
 

1057
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,709
to go with the centrifugal energy and
the inertia. Okay. So, as you're getting

1058
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
the inertia. Okay. So, as you're getting
 

1059
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,470
the inertia. Okay. So, as you're getting
this phase displacement in there, you

1060
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
this phase displacement in there, you
 

1061
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,590
this phase displacement in there, you
have to again summary understand it is

1062
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
have to again summary understand it is
 

1063
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,270
have to again summary understand it is
redundant with the energetic fulcrum

1064
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
redundant with the energetic fulcrum
 

1065
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,310
redundant with the energetic fulcrum
liver. Don't don't leave it out this guy

1066
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
liver. Don't don't leave it out this guy
 

1067
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,310
liver. Don't don't leave it out this guy
standing still and you're going to come

1068
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
standing still and you're going to come
 

1069
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,990
standing still and you're going to come
in and think you're going to do that.

1070
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
in and think you're going to do that.
 

1071
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,669
in and think you're going to do that.
That's just not going to happen. We get

1072
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
That's just not going to happen. We get
 

1073
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,669
That's just not going to happen. We get
a lot of don't try to move, right? Okay,

1074
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
a lot of don't try to move, right? Okay,
 

1075
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,350
a lot of don't try to move, right? Okay,
they're going to try to move. So, you

1076
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
they're going to try to move. So, you
 

1077
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,350
they're going to try to move. So, you
have to keep them occupied in those

1078
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
have to keep them occupied in those
 

1079
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:49,030
have to keep them occupied in those
inertial pathways and then you just bump

1080
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
inertial pathways and then you just bump
 

1081
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,950
inertial pathways and then you just bump
and go make sure that the energy is

1082
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
and go make sure that the energy is
 

1083
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,590
and go make sure that the energy is
enough leverage for the inertia that we

1084
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
enough leverage for the inertia that we
 

1085
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,270
enough leverage for the inertia that we
send in that way. Okay,

1086
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
send in that way. Okay,
 

1087
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,950
send in that way. Okay,
that will really help with how much base

1088
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
that will really help with how much base
 

1089
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,390
that will really help with how much base
integrity you need. Okay, you should

1090
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
integrity you need. Okay, you should
 

1091
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,910
integrity you need. Okay, you should
always try to improve your base

1092
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
always try to improve your base
 

1093
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,149
always try to improve your base
integrity which is dependent upon how

1094
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
integrity which is dependent upon how
 

1095
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,189
integrity which is dependent upon how
much energy can you send outward. Okay,

1096
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
much energy can you send outward. Okay,
 

1097
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,750
much energy can you send outward. Okay,
but since we're now doing technique and

1098
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
but since we're now doing technique and
 

1099
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,790
but since we're now doing technique and
not the energetic work, you it's where

1100
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
not the energetic work, you it's where
 

1101
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,750
not the energetic work, you it's where
your engine is at. Okay, so if I don't

1102
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
your engine is at. Okay, so if I don't
 

1103
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,630
your engine is at. Okay, so if I don't
have much as much internalization ground

1104
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
have much as much internalization ground
 

1105
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,510
have much as much internalization ground

1107
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,149

going and you won't need it. Just brush

1108
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:30,159
going and you won't need it. Just brush
 

1109
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,390
going and you won't need it. Just brush
there.

1110
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
there.
 

1111
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,910
there.
Don't overemphasize that stance at the

01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
Don't overemphasize that stance at the
 

1113
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,550
Don't overemphasize that stance at the
cost of the other energetic lever.

1114
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
cost of the other energetic lever.
 

1115

Any questions or comments?

1116
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:44,159
Any questions or comments?
 

1117
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,910
Any questions or comments?
All right, we'll take a little break. I

1118
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:45,920
All right, we'll take a little break. I
