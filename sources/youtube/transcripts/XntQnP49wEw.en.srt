00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,250

hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,260
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,980
hi I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
talking about forms in Aikido and how

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:12,990
talking about forms in Aikido and how
 

9
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,020
talking about forms in Aikido and how
forms are a collection of techniques and

10
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,030
forms are a collection of techniques and
 

11
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,570
forms are a collection of techniques and
not techniques in and of themselves now

12
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:17,580
not techniques in and of themselves now
 

13
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,920
not techniques in and of themselves now
that might seem like a funny and

14
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:18,930
that might seem like a funny and
 

15
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,170
that might seem like a funny and
specific distinction but it's a really

16
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,180
specific distinction but it's a really
 

17
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,260
specific distinction but it's a really
important distinction to make because we

18
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,270
important distinction to make because we
 

19
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,420
important distinction to make because we
tend to think that an Aikido form is

20
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,430
tend to think that an Aikido form is
 

21
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,310
tend to think that an Aikido form is
actually the way you're going to use

22
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
actually the way you're going to use
 

23
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,679
actually the way you're going to use
Aikido and we also tend to think that

24
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:30,689
Aikido and we also tend to think that
 

25
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,960
Aikido and we also tend to think that
that whatever happens at the end of the

26
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:32,970
that whatever happens at the end of the
 

27
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,360
that whatever happens at the end of the
form is the objective of Aikido

28
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,370
form is the objective of Aikido
 

29
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,760
form is the objective of Aikido
technique when in fact it's generally

30
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:37,770
technique when in fact it's generally
 

31
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,890
technique when in fact it's generally
the lowest percentage technique that we

32
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:39,900
the lowest percentage technique that we
 

33
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,380
the lowest percentage technique that we
have Aikido is filled with all kinds of

34
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,390
have Aikido is filled with all kinds of
 

35
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,700
have Aikido is filled with all kinds of
techniques and things that we don't even

36
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:43,710
techniques and things that we don't even
 

37
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,380
techniques and things that we don't even
often thinker techniques and we're going

38
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,390
often thinker techniques and we're going
 

39
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,880
often thinker techniques and we're going
to illustrate some of those in the form

40
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:46,890
to illustrate some of those in the form
 

41
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,490
to illustrate some of those in the form
we're about to show but it's important

42
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,500
we're about to show but it's important
 

43
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,690
we're about to show but it's important
understand those techniques are really

44
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:50,700
understand those techniques are really
 

45
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,760
understand those techniques are really
similar to techniques you would find in

46
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,770
similar to techniques you would find in
 

47
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,140
similar to techniques you would find in
martial arts from all kinds of other

48
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,150
martial arts from all kinds of other
 

49
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,730
martial arts from all kinds of other
cultures that are dealing with the same

50
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:55,740
cultures that are dealing with the same
 

51
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,890
cultures that are dealing with the same
context generally the context is one in

52
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:57,900
context generally the context is one in
 

53
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,450
context generally the context is one in
which someone has something in their

54
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,460
which someone has something in their
 

55
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,790
which someone has something in their
hand and that's probably going to be

56
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:01,800
hand and that's probably going to be
 

57
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,140
hand and that's probably going to be
some weapon of some sort if we're

58
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,150
some weapon of some sort if we're
 

59
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,749
some weapon of some sort if we're
talking about physical conflict and why

60
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:05,759
talking about physical conflict and why
 

61
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,249
talking about physical conflict and why
someone would be holding a hand or

62
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:07,259
someone would be holding a hand or
 

63
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,139
someone would be holding a hand or
swinging a hand or something like that

64
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:09,149
swinging a hand or something like that
 

65
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:10,190
swinging a hand or something like that
spell because there's a weapon in that

66
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,200
spell because there's a weapon in that
 

67
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,020
spell because there's a weapon in that
hand so the form we're gonna look at

68
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,030
hand so the form we're gonna look at
 

69
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,440
hand so the form we're gonna look at
today is katate dori Shiho nage and I'm

70
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,450
today is katate dori Shiho nage and I'm
 

71
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,700
today is katate dori Shiho nage and I'm
gonna get Josh out here we're gonna go

72
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:16,710
gonna get Josh out here we're gonna go
 

73
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,980
gonna get Josh out here we're gonna go
to work Josh all right so this week

74
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:21,990
to work Josh all right so this week
 

75
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,770
to work Josh all right so this week
we're talking about breaking the forms

76
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
we're talking about breaking the forms
 

77
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,969
we're talking about breaking the forms
down so when you see an Aikido form most

78
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:28,979
down so when you see an Aikido form most
 

79
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,379
down so when you see an Aikido form most
of us tend to make the mistake of

80
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:30,389
of us tend to make the mistake of
 

81
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:33,260
of us tend to make the mistake of
calling that form a technique and you

82
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,270
calling that form a technique and you
 

83
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,660
calling that form a technique and you
need to understand the form is actually

84
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:35,670
need to understand the form is actually
 

85
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,609
need to understand the form is actually
filled with techniques so there are a

86
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,619
filled with techniques so there are a
 

87
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,129
filled with techniques so there are a
ton of techniques in there so a form is

88
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:40,139
ton of techniques in there so a form is
 

89
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:44,090
ton of techniques in there so a form is
a tactical or strategic practice that

90
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,100
a tactical or strategic practice that
 

91
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,219
a tactical or strategic practice that
has a collection of techniques and we're

92
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:46,229
has a collection of techniques and we're
 

93
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,569
has a collection of techniques and we're
answering a bunch of different things

94
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
answering a bunch of different things
 

95
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,550
answering a bunch of different things
that could happen in any situation so

96
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:49,560
that could happen in any situation so
 

97
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,069
that could happen in any situation so
when you look at a form you tend to

98
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
when you look at a form you tend to
 

99
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,699
when you look at a form you tend to
think that the end goal in the idea of

100
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:55,709
think that the end goal in the idea of
 

101
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,769
think that the end goal in the idea of
that form is to get to the end and

102
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:57,779
that form is to get to the end and
 

103
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:59,690
that form is to get to the end and
instead it's generally teaching you that

104
00:01:59,690 --> 00:01:59,700
instead it's generally teaching you that
 

105
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,309
instead it's generally teaching you that
the end is the worst thing that could

106
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:01,319
the end is the worst thing that could
 

107
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,349
the end is the worst thing that could
possibly happen so right now we're going

108
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:03,359
possibly happen so right now we're going
 

109
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,089
possibly happen so right now we're going
to talk about katate dori

110
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:05,099
to talk about katate dori
 

111
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,460
to talk about katate dori
Shiho nage

112
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,470
Shiho nage
 

113
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,480
Shiho nage
all right so in katate dori co nage we

114
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,490
all right so in katate dori co nage we
 

115
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,670
all right so in katate dori co nage we
start with a katate dori now this is a

116
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
start with a katate dori now this is a
 

117
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,949
start with a katate dori now this is a
little bit outside the scope of this

118
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
little bit outside the scope of this
 

119
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
little bit outside the scope of this
video but I kind of want to talk about

120
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,730
video but I kind of want to talk about
 

121
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,280
video but I kind of want to talk about
why the top they'd already exist so you

122
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,290
why the top they'd already exist so you
 

123
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,570
why the top they'd already exist so you
can understand why that might exist

124
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:21,580
can understand why that might exist
 

125
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,660
can understand why that might exist
right so let's say this guy broke into

126
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:24,670
right so let's say this guy broke into
 

127
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,060
right so let's say this guy broke into
my house late at night and I had a

128
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,070
my house late at night and I had a
 

129
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,680
my house late at night and I had a
weapon in my hand and I'm planning to

130
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:28,690
weapon in my hand and I'm planning to
 

131
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,510
weapon in my hand and I'm planning to
use the weapon this guy's surprised me

132
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:30,520
use the weapon this guy's surprised me
 

133
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,610
use the weapon this guy's surprised me
right because our first Aikido goal good

134
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:32,620
right because our first Aikido goal good
 

135
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,199
right because our first Aikido goal good
Aikido would be keeping distance from

136
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,209
Aikido would be keeping distance from
 

137
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,490
Aikido would be keeping distance from
this guy so he could never get near me

138
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:35,500
this guy so he could never get near me
 

139
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,800
this guy so he could never get near me
um but you know maybe he came out around

140
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:37,810
um but you know maybe he came out around
 

141
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,840
um but you know maybe he came out around
the corner or who knows what and he sees

142
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:39,850
the corner or who knows what and he sees
 

143
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,310
the corner or who knows what and he sees
that I have a weapon in my hand so the

144
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,320
that I have a weapon in my hand so the
 

145
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,990
that I have a weapon in my hand so the
second he sees that if he shoots down he

146
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,000
second he sees that if he shoots down he
 

147
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,760
second he sees that if he shoots down he
grabs it and he's gonna be attacking my

148
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:44,770
grabs it and he's gonna be attacking my
 

149
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,310
grabs it and he's gonna be attacking my
face somehow right so when you see this

150
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,320
face somehow right so when you see this
 

151
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,630
face somehow right so when you see this
all of a sudden that makes sense because

152
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
all of a sudden that makes sense because
 

153
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
all of a sudden that makes sense because
we didn't do that right so if he just

154
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,170
we didn't do that right so if he just
 

155
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,660
we didn't do that right so if he just
came in to hit my face I'm gonna be

156
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,670
came in to hit my face I'm gonna be
 

157
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,400
came in to hit my face I'm gonna be
doing this right so it's a bad trade for

158
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,410
doing this right so it's a bad trade for
 

159
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,870
doing this right so it's a bad trade for
him because when I naturally go like

160
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:54,880
him because when I naturally go like
 

161
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,190
him because when I naturally go like
this then I'm gonna load him up with

162
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
