1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,309

so we had a question on we will use it

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
so we had a question on we will use it
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,150
so we had a question on we will use it
to explain more to you from Five Points

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
to explain more to you from Five Points
 

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,890
to explain more to you from Five Points
of

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:09,900
of
 

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,850
of
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:13,860
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth
 

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,990
the tactics involved in Ikea's growth
okay

10
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,000
okay
 

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,490
okay
so you have what we would do as chemo

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:19,500
so you have what we would do as chemo
 

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,470
so you have what we would do as chemo
okay

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480

 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,470

and it kind of misleads you

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
and it kind of misleads you
 

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,929
and it kind of misleads you
if you make the mistake that that's how

18
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:29,939
if you make the mistake that that's how
 

19
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,630
if you make the mistake that that's how
the technique shows up tastic that's a

20
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
the technique shows up tastic that's a
 

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,810
the technique shows up tastic that's a
kihon waza okay it's like a coded

22
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:35,820
kihon waza okay it's like a coded
 

23
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,049
kihon waza okay it's like a coded
message for all kinds of things

24
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,059
message for all kinds of things
 

25
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,630
message for all kinds of things
um but it's taxable application is not

26
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
um but it's taxable application is not
 

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,170
um but it's taxable application is not
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper

28
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,180
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper
 

29
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,510
a one-to-one code you gotta look deeper
than that okay

30
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
than that okay
 

31
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,650
than that okay
um

32
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:51,660
um
 

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,130
um
so where does it show up

34
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,140
so where does it show up
 

35
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,069
so where does it show up
uh we'll do it first from

36
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
uh we'll do it first from
 

37
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,189
uh we'll do it first from
uh you'll get Tony okay so let's say I'm

38
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
uh you'll get Tony okay so let's say I'm
 

39
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,910
uh you'll get Tony okay so let's say I'm
going to throw into the front kazushi

40
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:04,920
going to throw into the front kazushi
 

41
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,390
going to throw into the front kazushi
the front inward kazushi okay

42
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
the front inward kazushi okay
 

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,649
the front inward kazushi okay
and the guy

44
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:11,659
and the guy
 

45
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,990
and the guy
really hangs on to his balance okay now

46
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
really hangs on to his balance okay now
 

47
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,310
really hangs on to his balance okay now
stay there

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
stay there
 

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,550
stay there
the the energy of the throw is going

50
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
the the energy of the throw is going
 

51
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,870
the the energy of the throw is going
this way

52
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
this way
 

53
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,310
this way
okay

54
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
okay
 

55
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,690
okay
and what ends up happening and we not

56
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
and what ends up happening and we not
 

57
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,370
and what ends up happening and we not
only does his body

58
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,380
only does his body
 

59
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,789
only does his body
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal

60
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:31,799
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal
 

61
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,630
uh is going to spin on that centrifugal

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,710
energy
but just his body alone the way that his

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
but just his body alone the way that his
 

65
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,890
but just his body alone the way that his
mass is set up if he takes that hand

ground uh don't try not to roll try to

68
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
ground uh don't try not to roll try to
 

69
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,710
ground uh don't try not to roll try to
stay in place and leave your leg high

70
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:45,720
stay in place and leave your leg high
 

71
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,130
stay in place and leave your leg high
and you'll see don't follow what you'll

72
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,140
and you'll see don't follow what you'll
 

73
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,230
and you'll see don't follow what you'll
see that that leg is gonna is gonna

74
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,240
see that that leg is gonna is gonna
 

75
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,270
see that that leg is gonna is gonna
start to eventually spin out if you need

76
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
start to eventually spin out if you need
 

77
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,550
start to eventually spin out if you need
to use me for some base but don't hold

78
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
to use me for some base but don't hold
 

79
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,310
to use me for some base but don't hold
on yeah you see that leg starts to go

80
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
on yeah you see that leg starts to go
 

81
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,950
on yeah you see that leg starts to go
that way okay and you can run that

82
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
that way okay and you can run that
 

83
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,410
that way okay and you can run that
experiment on your own you just you just

84
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,420
experiment on your own you just you just
 

85
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,630
experiment on your own you just you just
gets here and eventually that leg will

86
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
gets here and eventually that leg will
 

87
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,830
gets here and eventually that leg will
go to the outside

88
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:08,840

 

89
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,130

is a

90
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,140

 

91
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,150

state so uh a guy that is trying to pull

92
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
state so uh a guy that is trying to pull
 

93
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,030
state so uh a guy that is trying to pull
eventually that leg will go out and it's

94
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,040
eventually that leg will go out and it's
 

95
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,750
eventually that leg will go out and it's
gonna be kind of hard uh to demonstrate

96
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
gonna be kind of hard uh to demonstrate
 

97
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,510
gonna be kind of hard uh to demonstrate
but let's see what happens okay so

98
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:26,520
but let's see what happens okay so
 

99
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,089
but let's see what happens okay so
trying to resist to throw as much as off

100
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:29,099
trying to resist to throw as much as off
 

101
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,270
trying to resist to throw as much as off
that step okay

102
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
that step okay
 

103
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,250
that step okay
yeah

104
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,260
yeah
 

105
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:47,170
yeah
foreign

106
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:47,180

 

107
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,210

so imagine we'll slow down and we'll

108
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,220
so imagine we'll slow down and we'll
 

109
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,290
so imagine we'll slow down and we'll
start to see that so that when that leg

110
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,300
start to see that so that when that leg
 

111
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,690
start to see that so that when that leg
is gonna get around

112
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
is gonna get around
 

113
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,589
is gonna get around
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not

114
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not
 

115
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,390
so yeah it'll be like that okay it's not
going to be

116
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
going to be
 

117
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,089
going to be
in the front inward kazushi so I'll show

118
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:05,099
in the front inward kazushi so I'll show
 

119
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,130
in the front inward kazushi so I'll show
you if you pay attention it's gonna be

120
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,140
you if you pay attention it's gonna be
 

121
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,930
you if you pay attention it's gonna be
on the back side

122
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940
on the back side
 

123
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,330
on the back side
of that leg okay

124
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,340
of that leg okay
 

125
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,030
of that leg okay
you know what I'm saying and all you got

126
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
you know what I'm saying and all you got
 

127
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,970
you know what I'm saying and all you got
to do is Chuck someone and there it is

128
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:19,980
to do is Chuck someone and there it is
 

129
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,649
to do is Chuck someone and there it is
every time so it's where for example

130
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:23,659
every time so it's where for example
 

131
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:28,729
every time so it's where for example
the sweeps are in that same place okay

132
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:28,739
the sweeps are in that same place okay
 

133
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,309
the sweeps are in that same place okay
um

134
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
um
 

135
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,990
um
that little thing all right let's let's

136
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,000
that little thing all right let's let's
 

137
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,250
that little thing all right let's let's
get there bye

138
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,260

 

139
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,910

[Music]

140
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
[Music]
 

141
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,970
[Music]
geometrically so uh the guys coming in

142
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:49,980
geometrically so uh the guys coming in
 

143
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,610
geometrically so uh the guys coming in
and then we're trying for that and then

144
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
and then we're trying for that and then
 

145
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,630
and then we're trying for that and then
what he does is he goes ahead and

146
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,640
what he does is he goes ahead and
 

147
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,750
what he does is he goes ahead and
sacrifices this balance position okay he

148
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
sacrifices this balance position okay he
 

149
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,350
sacrifices this balance position okay he
in essence he's going with the energy

150
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
in essence he's going with the energy
 

151
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,949
in essence he's going with the energy
you see that's what he's doing and so if

152
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
you see that's what he's doing and so if
 

153
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,030
you see that's what he's doing and so if
you look for uh where it tends to come

154
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
you look for uh where it tends to come
 

155
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,949
you look for uh where it tends to come
off is

156
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
off is
 

157
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,509
off is
um you were trying to do a momentum

158
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
um you were trying to do a momentum
 

159
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,490
um you were trying to do a momentum
throw

160
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,500
throw
 

161
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,550
throw
and the guy does not fall off the regain

162
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
and the guy does not fall off the regain
 

163
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,830
and the guy does not fall off the regain
their balance okay and you you held on

164
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
their balance okay and you you held on
 

165
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,050
their balance okay and you you held on
to their arm or something like that so

166
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,060
to their arm or something like that so
 

167
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,090
to their arm or something like that so
if you pay attention like in in this

168
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,100
if you pay attention like in in this
 

169
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,610
if you pay attention like in in this
version we come around here

170
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,620
version we come around here
 

171
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,070
version we come around here
it's doing the same thing

172
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,080
it's doing the same thing
 

173
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,610
it's doing the same thing
you're in that key mode okay or even in

174
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,620
you're in that key mode okay or even in
 

175
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,850
you're in that key mode okay or even in
the the basic kihon when when you come

176
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:37,860
the the basic kihon when when you come
 

177
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,870
the the basic kihon when when you come
around like that right uh from where I'm

178
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
around like that right uh from where I'm
 

179
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,650
around like that right uh from where I'm
at he's it say then his stance is in

180
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
at he's it say then his stance is in
 

181
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,670
at he's it say then his stance is in
that same thing that leg is behind the

182
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
that same thing that leg is behind the
 

183
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,530
that same thing that leg is behind the
front leg and you see the sweep is

184
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:54,540

 

185
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,749

from this side home

186
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
from this side home
 

187
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,629
from this side home
that leg is it that back leg is in front

188
00:04:59,629 --> 00:04:59,639
that leg is it that back leg is in front
 

189
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,890
that leg is it that back leg is in front
of his leg

190
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
of his leg
 

191
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,990
of his leg
can you see that

192
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000
can you see that
 

193
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,469
can you see that
can you see it okay but as soon as I go

194
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
can you see it okay but as soon as I go
 

195
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,189
can you see it okay but as soon as I go
like that there it is so I'll show just

196
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,199
like that there it is so I'll show just
 

197
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,710
like that there it is so I'll show just
to show you uh I'm gonna move that leg

198
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
to show you uh I'm gonna move that leg
 

199
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,150
to show you uh I'm gonna move that leg
back

200
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
back
 

201
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,490
back
okay and I slide them around and I

202
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
okay and I slide them around and I
 

203
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,469
okay and I slide them around and I
thought behind him do you see it moved

204
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
thought behind him do you see it moved
 

205
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,170
thought behind him do you see it moved
that way the key on is is doing that

206
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,180
that way the key on is is doing that
 

207
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,189
that way the key on is is doing that
same thing right from where I'm at

208
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
same thing right from where I'm at
 

209
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,430
same thing right from where I'm at
but what you want to know is when you're

210
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
but what you want to know is when you're
 

211
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,810
but what you want to know is when you're
doing front inward positions a guy can

212
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,820
doing front inward positions a guy can
 

213
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,189
doing front inward positions a guy can
sacrifice

214
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
sacrifice
 

215
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,330
sacrifice
his orientation towards you and put get

216
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,340
his orientation towards you and put get
 

217
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,770
his orientation towards you and put get
that foot there

218
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:39,780
that foot there
 

219
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,189
that foot there
okay you got it and it will come up more

220
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
okay you got it and it will come up more
 

221
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,990
okay you got it and it will come up more
than not in live situations where you

222
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
than not in live situations where you
 

223
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,710
than not in live situations where you
did a momentum truck okay the way you

224
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:51,720
did a momentum truck okay the way you
 

225
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,290
did a momentum truck okay the way you
get out of it in your is with your

226
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:54,300
get out of it in your is with your
 

227
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,110
get out of it in your is with your
cookie projection that foot does not get

228
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
cookie projection that foot does not get
 

229
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,689
cookie projection that foot does not get
to stay there you see that but in a

230
00:05:59,689 --> 00:05:59,699
to stay there you see that but in a
 

231
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,210
to stay there you see that but in a
momentum throat you go to do it and he

232
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,220
momentum throat you go to do it and he
 

233
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,350
momentum throat you go to do it and he
can do it

234
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
can do it
 

235
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,550
can do it
okay

236
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
okay
 

237
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,610
okay
in the projection throw that foot does

238
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,620
in the projection throw that foot does
 

239
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,890
in the projection throw that foot does
not

240
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:09,900

 

241
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,050

and that's why he can't counter that

242
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
and that's why he can't counter that
 

243
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,770
and that's why he can't counter that
throat okay but it happens a lot in live

244
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:15,780
throat okay but it happens a lot in live
 

245
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,969
throat okay but it happens a lot in live
situations

246
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
situations
 

247
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,430
situations
uh especially if you don't have the

248
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
uh especially if you don't have the
 

249
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,350
uh especially if you don't have the
projection skills okay so uh we're going

250
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,360
projection skills okay so uh we're going
 

251
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,230
projection skills okay so uh we're going
here we'll do that momentum throw and

252
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,240
here we'll do that momentum throw and
 

253
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,730
here we'll do that momentum throw and
that's where it is

254
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:28,740
that's where it is
 

255
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,450
that's where it is
okay that's where your shimogaga is

256
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,460
okay that's where your shimogaga is
 

257
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,330
okay that's where your shimogaga is
there's something to note though

258
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340
there's something to note though
 

259
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,330
there's something to note though
uh in the keyhorn

260
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,340
uh in the keyhorn
 

261
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,450
uh in the keyhorn
he's allowed to stay straight you see he

262
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,460
he's allowed to stay straight you see he
 

263
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,110
he's allowed to stay straight you see he
even if he turns a little he's pretty up

264
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120

 

265
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,790

um back here so we can keep the

266
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:49,800
um back here so we can keep the
 

267
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,409
um back here so we can keep the
orientation

268
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:51,419
orientation
 

269
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,870
orientation
and this

270
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
and this
 

271
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,370
and this
this slice

272
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380

 

273
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,969

it would be able for him to do that

274
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:01,979
it would be able for him to do that
 

275
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,370
it would be able for him to do that
it's because this hand tends to cut down

276
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
it's because this hand tends to cut down
 

277
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,010
it's because this hand tends to cut down
so you're going and you're going to see

278
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
so you're going and you're going to see
 

279
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,930
so you're going and you're going to see
that his head is down when he does that

280
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:08,940
that his head is down when he does that
 

281
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,990
that his head is down when he does that
see now it makes no sense and this is

282
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
see now it makes no sense and this is
 

283
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,270
see now it makes no sense and this is
the second thing it makes no sense to

284
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
the second thing it makes no sense to
 

285
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,830
the second thing it makes no sense to
bring them back up

286
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
bring them back up
 

287
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,730
bring them back up
okay

288
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740

 

289
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,029

so we'll do the keyhon

290
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
so we'll do the keyhon
 

291
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,790
so we'll do the keyhon
and I'm going to set up that stance

292
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
and I'm going to set up that stance
 

293
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,070
and I'm going to set up that stance
there it is okay

294
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
there it is okay
 

295
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,589
there it is okay
and in the keyhand you kind of do bring

296
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
and in the keyhand you kind of do bring
 

297
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,930
and in the keyhand you kind of do bring
him up

298
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:32,940
him up
 

299
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,270
him up
but we want to pay attention to

300
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
but we want to pay attention to
 

301
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,230
but we want to pay attention to
something in the keyhon that helps

302
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,240
something in the keyhon that helps
 

303
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,330
something in the keyhon that helps
a little bit more

304
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,340
a little bit more
 

305
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,409
a little bit more
okay I am going to not

306
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:45,419
okay I am going to not
 

307
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:52,490
okay I am going to not
turn

308
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500

 

309
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,730

I'm going to come across

310
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740

 

311
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,129

I'll do those two versions

312
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:01,139
I'll do those two versions
 

313
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,330
I'll do those two versions
okay

314
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:02,340
okay
 

315
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,230
okay
cool

316
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
cool
 

317
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,670
cool
that's it I'll just keep it with the

318
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,680
that's it I'll just keep it with the
 

319
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,589
that's it I'll just keep it with the
motel so mote I go in then I turn

320
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
motel so mote I go in then I turn
 

321
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,110
motel so mote I go in then I turn
then I entered again

322
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,120

 

323
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,249

is where

324
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:16,259
is where
 

325
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,629
is where
I keep my Center this way I step across

326
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
I keep my Center this way I step across
 

327
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,189
I keep my Center this way I step across
there's

328
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199

 

329
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,129

same beginning but I step across there

330
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:28,139
same beginning but I step across there
 

331
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,469
same beginning but I step across there
it goes

332
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
it goes
 

333
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,690
it goes
there's no current can you see that I'll

334
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:32,700
there's no current can you see that I'll
 

335
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,370
there's no current can you see that I'll
do the other one

336
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,380

okay let's get there we have all those
 

345
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,949
okay let's get there we have all those
other videos I'm not gonna go into the

346
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
other videos I'm not gonna go into the
 

347
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,530
other videos I'm not gonna go into the
like the grip game okay I'll just

348
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,540
like the grip game okay I'll just
 

349
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,050
like the grip game okay I'll just
quickly say here your shimanaga is not

350
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060
quickly say here your shimanaga is not
 

351
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,630
quickly say here your shimanaga is not
on the forearm it doesn't work because

352
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
on the forearm it doesn't work because
 

353
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,449
on the forearm it doesn't work because
you do not have the mechanical advantage

354
00:08:59,449 --> 00:08:59,459
you do not have the mechanical advantage
 

355
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,509
you do not have the mechanical advantage
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical

356
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:02,519
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical
 

357
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,730
don't hurt me uh he has the mechanical
advantage okay

358
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:04,740
advantage okay
 

359
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,610
advantage okay
um he can just pull down on his elbow

360
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:07,620
um he can just pull down on his elbow
 

361
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,150
um he can just pull down on his elbow
and I can never hold that okay but once

362
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,160
and I can never hold that okay but once
 

363
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,329
and I can never hold that okay but once
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn

364
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:14,339
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn
 

365
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,449
I get to the wrist do you see and I turn
that more and now he does not have a

366
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:17,459
that more and now he does not have a
 

367
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,310
that more and now he does not have a
mechanical advantage because the smaller

368
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
mechanical advantage because the smaller
 

369
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,850
mechanical advantage because the smaller
joint is working against him so uh if we

370
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:22,860
joint is working against him so uh if we
 

371
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,430
joint is working against him so uh if we
you could even have them higher as he

372
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
you could even have them higher as he
 

373
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,110
you could even have them higher as he
tries to pull his elbow it makes his

374
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
tries to pull his elbow it makes his
 

375
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,670
tries to pull his elbow it makes his
balance go because it goes into his

376
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
balance go because it goes into his
 

377
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,190
balance go because it goes into his
wrist so you cannot do it here you

378
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
wrist so you cannot do it here you
 

379
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,930
wrist so you cannot do it here you
should never do it here this is you're

380
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:32,940
should never do it here this is you're
 

381
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,090
should never do it here this is you're
you're fooling yourself okay I don't

382
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
you're fooling yourself okay I don't
 

383
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,250
you're fooling yourself okay I don't
care how high it is put your elbow

384
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,260
care how high it is put your elbow
 

385
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,530
care how high it is put your elbow
really high it's you don't have the

386
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,540
really high it's you don't have the
 

387
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,329

situations in your nawaza this would be

392
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:46,440
situations in your nawaza this would be
 

393
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,470
situations in your nawaza this would be
thumbless grip so you don't expose the

thumbless grip so you don't expose the
 

395
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,690

why
 

403
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,870
why
don't we want him standing like that

404
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
don't we want him standing like that
 

405

don't okay any joint manipulation
 

452
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,069
don't okay any joint manipulation
requires that force be stabilized

453

okay if I move my feet
it does not work now it's off do it do

00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,019
it does not work now it's off do it do
 

470
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,910
it does not work now it's off do it do
you see and he would have to turn to put

471
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:46,920
you see and he would have to turn to put
 

472
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,710
you see and he would have to turn to put
it back on

473
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
it back on
 

474
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,530
it back on
he'll put it back on do you see

475
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,540
he'll put it back on do you see
 

476
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,710
he'll put it back on do you see
but what can I do so he tries to put it

477
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
but what can I do so he tries to put it
 

478
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,650
but what can I do so he tries to put it
on I change the joint manipulation the

479
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
on I change the joint manipulation the
 

480
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,470
on I change the joint manipulation the
the angles of the articulation he moves

481
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
the angles of the articulation he moves
 

482
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,509
the angles of the articulation he moves
and I move

483
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:04,519

 

484
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,030

they're saying it it'll never stop you

485
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
they're saying it it'll never stop you

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,110
they're saying it it'll never stop you
get that so your techniques have ways of

487
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,120
get that so your techniques have ways of
 

488
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,150
get that so your techniques have ways of
stopping them

489
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
stopping them
 

490
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,290
stopping them
and the way is

491
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:17,300
and the way is
 

492
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,889
and the way is

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,389
the only way I keep them tracking the
inertial path is not let them Bop off

503
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:35,399
inertial path is not let them Bop off
 

504
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,550
inertial path is not let them Bop off
that's taking them out of the inertial

505
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:37,560
that's taking them out of the inertial
 

506
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,269
that's taking them out of the inertial
path and now he has full mobility and

507
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
path and now he has full mobility and
 

508
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,550
path and now he has full mobility and
the joint The Joint lock or the joint

509
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,560
the joint The Joint lock or the joint
 

510
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,690
the joint The Joint lock or the joint
manipulation will not work so we go and

511
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:47,700
manipulation will not work so we go and
 

512
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,449
manipulation will not work so we go and
as long as I keep my feet here go and he

513
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:50,459
as long as I keep my feet here go and he
 

514
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,310
as long as I keep my feet here go and he
does she who knock it it is going to

515
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
does she who knock it it is going to
 

516
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,170
does she who knock it it is going to
work that leverage thing that I just

517
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,180
work that leverage thing that I just
 

518
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,150
work that leverage thing that I just
told you is going to work okay

519
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,160

 

520
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,449

but if I move my feet

521
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:02,459
but if I move my feet
 

522
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,990
but if I move my feet
even when he's here you see and I moved

523
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
even when he's here you see and I moved
 

524
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,170
even when he's here you see and I moved
to here it's not going to work now so

525
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,180
to here it's not going to work now so
 

526
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,210
to here it's not going to work now so
even that little hand leverage thing

527
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
even that little hand leverage thing
 

528
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,090
even that little hand leverage thing
right if I just keep moving my feet it

529
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,100
right if I just keep moving my feet it
 

530
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,530
right if I just keep moving my feet it
won't work

531
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
won't work
 

532
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,430
won't work
so my body has to be preoccupied

533
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
so my body has to be preoccupied
 

534
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,310
so my body has to be preoccupied
and it can't be straight up because then

535
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
and it can't be straight up because then
 

536
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,710
and it can't be straight up because then
it is Back in Balance it now has

537
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
it is Back in Balance it now has
 

538
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,949
it is Back in Balance it now has
Mobility do you get that and the

539
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:27,959
Mobility do you get that and the
 

540
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,710
Mobility do you get that and the
resisting person will not be there okay

541
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
resisting person will not be there okay
 

542
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,690
resisting person will not be there okay
so

543
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:32,700
so
 

544
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,210
so
when you come into this technique this

545
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,220
when you come into this technique this
 

546
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,910
when you come into this technique this
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I

547
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I
 

548
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,710
little tilt that I have in the keyhorn I
am going to keep

549
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,720
am going to keep
 

550
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,410
am going to keep
I'm going to keep that tilt look try to

551
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:42,420
I'm going to keep that tilt look try to
 

552
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,389
I'm going to keep that tilt look try to
see where his body is

553
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
see where his body is
 

554
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,470
see where his body is
his body's going this way

555
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480

 

556
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,370

okay

557
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,380
okay
 

558
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,129
okay
so I'm gonna move myself

559
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,139
so I'm gonna move myself
 

560
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,370
so I'm gonna move myself
so that it will will make okay keep

561
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:55,380
so that it will will make okay keep
 

562
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,710
so that it will will make okay keep
going that way I'm gonna move myself so

563
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:57,720
going that way I'm gonna move myself so
 

564
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
going that way I'm gonna move myself so
that I capture

565
00:13:59,870 --> 00:13:59,880
that I capture
 

566
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,030
that I capture
there okay where is there

567
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,040
there okay where is there
 

568
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,090
there okay where is there
there is that sweet spot he goes

569
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,100
there is that sweet spot he goes
 

570
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,490
there is that sweet spot he goes
where your compliant new kid did not

571
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:10,500
where your compliant new kid did not
 

572
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,470
where your compliant new kid did not
move their feet do you see that if you

573
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
move their feet do you see that if you
 

574
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,990
move their feet do you see that if you
get shihonage and I don't move my feet

575
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
get shihonage and I don't move my feet
 

576
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,550
get shihonage and I don't move my feet
he's got you okay butterfly he doesn't

577
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,560
he's got you okay butterfly he doesn't
 

578
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,250
he's got you okay butterfly he doesn't
have me anymore so you have to replicate

579
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,260
have me anymore so you have to replicate
 

580
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,949
have me anymore so you have to replicate
that but now in motion so you have to

581
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
that but now in motion so you have to
 

582
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,569
that but now in motion so you have to
kind of think

583
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:26,579
kind of think
 

584
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,850
kind of think
he's going this way

585
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:28,860
he's going this way
 

586
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,310
he's going this way
he's gone around me

587
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
he's gone around me
 

588
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,350
he's gone around me
so I move

589
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
so I move
 

590
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,829
so I move
so I catch him there

591
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:36,839
so I catch him there
 

592
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,389
so I catch him there
you see that

593
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399

 

594
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,430

and raw

595
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,440

 

596
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,189

another way of looking at it

597
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
another way of looking at it
 

598
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,990
another way of looking at it
is he he stays in that tilt

599
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
is he he stays in that tilt
 

600
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,110
is he he stays in that tilt
I don't stand back around

601
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120

 

602
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,290

today

603
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,300

 

604
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,069

okay let's try

605
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:07,079
okay let's try
 

606
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,790
okay let's try
some other things so the other mistake

607
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
some other things so the other mistake
 

608
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,750
some other things so the other mistake
is you pick him up

609
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,760

 

610
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,970

beginner mistake

611
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:16,980
beginner mistake
 

612
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:27,870
beginner mistake
you're on this foreign

613
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:27,880

 

614
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,210

[Music]

615
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,220

 

616
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,870

he has too much Leverage

617
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:35,880

 

618
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,569

I don't have any leverage even even if

619
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:38,579
I don't have any leverage even even if
 

620
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,810
I don't have any leverage even even if
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to

621
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to
 

622
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,889
I'm on the hand it's very difficult to
keep this leverage okay which is why if

623
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:45,899
keep this leverage okay which is why if
 

624
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,449
keep this leverage okay which is why if
he steps back

625
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:47,459
he steps back
 

626
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,269
he steps back
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you

627
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:50,279
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you
 

628
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,170
He's Able more to lower his elbow do you
see and I lose leverage as we go okay

629
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,180
see and I lose leverage as we go okay
 

630
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,990
see and I lose leverage as we go okay
it doesn't change if you put his elbow

631
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
it doesn't change if you put his elbow
 

632
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,490
it doesn't change if you put his elbow
here

633
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,500
here
 

634
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,650
here
on the side and you have like some kind

635
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:00,660
on the side and you have like some kind
 

636
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,290
on the side and you have like some kind
of shoulder elbow lock it doesn't take

637
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:03,300
of shoulder elbow lock it doesn't take
 

638
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,689
of shoulder elbow lock it doesn't take
much for him to pull that don't hurt me

639
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:05,699
much for him to pull that don't hurt me
 

640
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,970
much for him to pull that don't hurt me
again these just put your elbow

641
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:07,980
again these just put your elbow
 

642
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,550
again these just put your elbow
underneath here is that okay

643
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
underneath here is that okay
 

644
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,009
underneath here is that okay
no no no

645
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:13,019
no no no
 

646
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,250
no no no
body has to be up the elbow has to be up

647
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,260
body has to be up the elbow has to be up
 

648
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,490
body has to be up the elbow has to be up
which means his Center has to be forward

649
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:18,500
which means his Center has to be forward
 

650
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,490
which means his Center has to be forward
okay you can't get his elbow up

651
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:22,500
okay you can't get his elbow up
 

652
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,430
okay you can't get his elbow up
with his centered knot forward which

653
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
with his centered knot forward which
 

654
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,769
with his centered knot forward which
won't happen when he's straight it's

655
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:27,779
won't happen when he's straight it's
 

656
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,230
won't happen when he's straight it's
parallel pretty much and it's very easy

657
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
parallel pretty much and it's very easy
 

658
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,030
parallel pretty much and it's very easy
for him to pull down you'll lose

659
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
for him to pull down you'll lose
 

660
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,370
for him to pull down you'll lose
leverage okay

661
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:34,380
leverage okay
 

662
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,249
leverage okay
so keep that all in mind as you're doing

663
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:37,259
so keep that all in mind as you're doing
 

664
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,670
so keep that all in mind as you're doing
the this like Dad don't have his elbow

665
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:40,680
the this like Dad don't have his elbow
 

666
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,509
the this like Dad don't have his elbow
look

667
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
look
 

668
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,730
look
it's parallel can you see from behind me

669
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:43,740
it's parallel can you see from behind me
 

670
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,650
it's parallel can you see from behind me
or no

671
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:45,660
or no
 

672
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,069
or no
no is it it's parallel that's not gonna

673
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:49,079
no is it it's parallel that's not gonna
 

674
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,910
no is it it's parallel that's not gonna
work

675
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920

 

676
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,970

so his elbow is gonna go up do you see

677
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:55,980
so his elbow is gonna go up do you see
 

678
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,769
so his elbow is gonna go up do you see
it going up

679
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:57,779
it going up
 

680
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,889
it going up
you see that

681
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:00,899

 

682
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,470

I I have the intention

683
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
I I have the intention
 

684
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,630
I I have the intention
of getting his elbow to go

685
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:11,640

 

686
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,789

okay

687
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
okay
 

688
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,850
okay
another beginner mistake is uh he's

689
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:16,860
another beginner mistake is uh he's
 

690
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,470
another beginner mistake is uh he's
gonna go

691
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
gonna go
 

692
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,490
gonna go
right and then reaction right and then I

693
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:22,500
right and then reaction right and then I
 

694
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,010
right and then reaction right and then I
turn I can turn like this you see how my

695
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,020
turn I can turn like this you see how my
 

696
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,949
turn I can turn like this you see how my
hips turn that way you see that but in

697
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
hips turn that way you see that but in
 

698
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,710
hips turn that way you see that but in
the technique is which way were my hips

699
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
the technique is which way were my hips
 

700
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,770
the technique is which way were my hips
going my hips going this way do you

701
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:33,780
going my hips going this way do you
 

702
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,950
going my hips going this way do you
understand

703
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960

 

704
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,669

so usually the way that happens but you

705
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:40,679
so usually the way that happens but you
 

706
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,450
so usually the way that happens but you
want to pay attention to it is uh you

707
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:44,460
want to pay attention to it is uh you
 

708
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,570
want to pay attention to it is uh you
are not controlling their center with it

709
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,580
are not controlling their center with it
 

710
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,750
are not controlling their center with it
being preoccupied on an inertial path so

711
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:50,760
being preoccupied on an inertial path so
 

712
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,710
being preoccupied on an inertial path so
uh maybe on your on your Keyhole they're

713
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
uh maybe on your on your Keyhole they're
 

714
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,810
uh maybe on your on your Keyhole they're
just standing still do you see and then

715
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:56,820
just standing still do you see and then
 

716
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,430
just standing still do you see and then
you come around like that and now he

717
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,440
you come around like that and now he
 

718
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,690
you come around like that and now he
could turn it into that you could turn

719
00:17:59,690 --> 00:17:59,700
could turn it into that you could turn
 

720
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,669
could turn it into that you could turn
his hips into that technique and take

721
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
his hips into that technique and take
 

722
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,750
his hips into that technique and take
that front brake off or maybe you did

723
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
that front brake off or maybe you did
 

724
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,630
that front brake off or maybe you did
initially occupy their Center but then

725
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
initially occupy their Center but then
 

726
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,789
initially occupy their Center but then
you gave it back to him now he could

727
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
you gave it back to him now he could
 

728
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,529
you gave it back to him now he could
turn into it you see so

729
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:14,539
turn into it you see so
 

730
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,930
turn into it you see so
his energy is going to be preoccupied

731
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:17,940
his energy is going to be preoccupied
 

732
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,970
his energy is going to be preoccupied
this way which would stop it from

733
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
this way which would stop it from
 

734
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,750
this way which would stop it from
turning this way okay but you can do

735
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
turning this way okay but you can do
 

736
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,090
turning this way okay but you can do
your lock in in a way that you actually

737
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,100
your lock in in a way that you actually
 

738
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,250
your lock in in a way that you actually
have a lock this is where that wrist

739
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,260
have a lock this is where that wrist
 

740
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,710
have a lock this is where that wrist
comes in handy where the forearm does

741
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
comes in handy where the forearm does
 

742
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,029
comes in handy where the forearm does
not okay the the wrist stops him

743
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
not okay the the wrist stops him
 

744
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,789
not okay the the wrist stops him
from turning that way do you see that it

745
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
from turning that way do you see that it
 

746
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,529
from turning that way do you see that it
adds it adds a kind of ashness to it

747
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:42,539
adds it adds a kind of ashness to it
 

748
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,549
adds it adds a kind of ashness to it
okay and uh the more he tries to turn

749
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
okay and uh the more he tries to turn
 

750
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,190
okay and uh the more he tries to turn
his his that way it goes into the lock

751
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
his his that way it goes into the lock
 

752
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,049
his his that way it goes into the lock
okay

753
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:51,059
okay
 

754
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,169
okay
so as you're coming around again another

755
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:54,179
so as you're coming around again another
 

756
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,970
so as you're coming around again another
reason not to be on the forearm because

757
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:55,980
reason not to be on the forearm because
 

758
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,770
reason not to be on the forearm because
it won't allow you to control his hips

759
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:57,780
it won't allow you to control his hips
 

760
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,750
it won't allow you to control his hips
he can turn his hips and then he'll take

761
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
he can turn his hips and then he'll take
 

762
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,750
he can turn his hips and then he'll take
your beautiful front brake ball

763
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:02,760
your beautiful front brake ball
 

764
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,570
your beautiful front brake ball
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy

765
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:05,580
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy
 

766
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,370
but the bad guy will escape the bad guy
will move their feet and pull their

767
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:07,380
will move their feet and pull their
 

768
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,650
will move their feet and pull their
elbow down and continue the attack okay

769
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:09,660
elbow down and continue the attack okay
 

770
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,810
elbow down and continue the attack okay
so you really want to right here you're

771
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:11,820
so you really want to right here you're
 

772
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,789
so you really want to right here you're
on the wrist already you already have a

773
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:13,799
on the wrist already you already have a
 

774
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,370
on the wrist already you already have a
footage you see and that stops his wrist

775
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:16,380
footage you see and that stops his wrist
 

776
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,830
footage you see and that stops his wrist
from turning around from turning into

777
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:18,840
from turning around from turning into
 

778
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,289
from turning around from turning into
Center stops the center

779
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:21,299
Center stops the center
 

780
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,990
Center stops the center
that gets that leg in the back and then

781
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
that gets that leg in the back and then
 

782
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,529
that gets that leg in the back and then
this chair stops him from uh turning

783
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:27,539
this chair stops him from uh turning
 

784
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:34,850
this chair stops him from uh turning
into them

785
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:34,860

 

786
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,730

okay so get on that wrist another reason

787
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:37,740
okay so get on that wrist another reason
 

788
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,529
okay so get on that wrist another reason
well I want to make sure that you

789
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:39,539
well I want to make sure that you
 

790
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,650
well I want to make sure that you
understand what happens if he does if he

791
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:42,660
understand what happens if he does if he
 

792
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,070
understand what happens if he does if he
gives me my center it's not occupied

793
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
gives me my center it's not occupied
 

794
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,930
gives me my center it's not occupied
with the inertial path going in the

795
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:47,940
with the inertial path going in the
 

796
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,150
with the inertial path going in the
opposite direction and if he does not

797
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
opposite direction and if he does not
 

798
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,049
opposite direction and if he does not
have uh my Center through where he's

799
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:54,059
have uh my Center through where he's
 

800
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,870
have uh my Center through where he's
touching such that

801
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880

 

802
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,409

I'm able to turn do you see for my nice

803
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:03,419
I'm able to turn do you see for my nice
 

804
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,070
I'm able to turn do you see for my nice
break fall of what when I said that the

805
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
break fall of what when I said that the
 

806
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,890
break fall of what when I said that the
bad guy would not be there what I mean

807
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:09,900
bad guy would not be there what I mean
 

808
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,350
bad guy would not be there what I mean
is since I have so much control in my

809
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360
is since I have so much control in my
 

810
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,230
is since I have so much control in my
Center you see I could just continue my

811
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,240
Center you see I could just continue my
 

812
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,590
Center you see I could just continue my
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all

813
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,600
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all
 

814
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,650
attack because I'm gonna neutralize all
the joint control he has because I'm

815
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,660
the joint control he has because I'm
 

816
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,450
the joint control he has because I'm
moving those joints in space you

817
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:23,460
moving those joints in space you
 

818
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,310
moving those joints in space you
understand okay so let's go back uh to

819
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
understand okay so let's go back uh to
 

820
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,370
understand okay so let's go back uh to
generating that kind of new Cami you see

821
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:31,380
generating that kind of new Cami you see
 

822
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,630
generating that kind of new Cami you see
and we're going to uh take a more

823
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:35,640
and we're going to uh take a more
 

824
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,970
and we're going to uh take a more
advantage of this tilt that he's in

825
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:37,980
advantage of this tilt that he's in
 

826
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,390
advantage of this tilt that he's in
we're going to even reduce it less okay

827
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,400
we're going to even reduce it less okay
 

828
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,169
we're going to even reduce it less okay
uh it doesn't matter we'll just do it

829
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:44,179
uh it doesn't matter we'll just do it
 

830
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:47,150
uh it doesn't matter we'll just do it
some uh throws

831
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,160
some uh throws
 

832
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:59,210
some uh throws
