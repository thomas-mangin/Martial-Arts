off to the other side and now he's ready
 

127
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,990
off to the other side and now he's ready
for yokan on the other side and come

128
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
for yokan on the other side and come
 

129
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,910
for yokan on the other side and come
through switches off boom boom boom boom

130
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:24,920
through switches off boom boom boom boom
 

131
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,309
through switches off boom boom boom boom
right so I can practice those over and

132
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
right so I can practice those over and
 

133
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,990
right so I can practice those over and
over and over and over and over and I

134

over and over and over and over and I
 

135
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,790
over and over and over and over and I
can do those with the uh the Gom barai

136
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
can do those with the uh the Gom barai
 

137
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,869
can do those with the uh the Gom barai
the low pass the jod on barai the high

138

bang Josh can come by okay I can do it
with low pass right like I just did a

150
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:44,680
with low pass right like I just did a
 

151
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,229
with low pass right like I just did a
second ago here fom sweep by Josh comes

152
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:47,239
second ago here fom sweep by Josh comes
 

153
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,309
second ago here fom sweep by Josh comes
around boom there it is right and so we

154
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
around boom there it is right and so we
 

155
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,350
around boom there it is right and so we
can high pass low pass back and forth so

156
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
can high pass low pass back and forth so
 

157
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,110
can high pass low pass back and forth so
that way he can practice those I can do

158
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
that way he can practice those I can do
 

159

basic defenses for them then we can
stack those together so we give a little

204
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
stack those together so we give a little
 

205
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,470
