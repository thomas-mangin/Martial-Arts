1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,589

all right so uh when you do any

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:10,599
all right so uh when you do any
 

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,869
all right so uh when you do any
technique actually you do have like a a

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:14,879
technique actually you do have like a a
 

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,990
technique actually you do have like a a
you always have a Yin yield in your keyh

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,000
you always have a Yin yield in your keyh
 

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,390
you always have a Yin yield in your keyh
horn

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
horn
 

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,070
horn
okay but what happens is that our Yin

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
okay but what happens is that our Yin
 

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,109
okay but what happens is that our Yin
yield is

12
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
yield is
 

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,630
yield is
external so he is pushing per

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:27,640
external so he is pushing per
 

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,669
external so he is pushing per
prescription and then I just kind of get

16
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
prescription and then I just kind of get
 

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,510
prescription and then I just kind of get
out of way and he kind of Falls

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:32,520
out of way and he kind of Falls
 

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,709
out of way and he kind of Falls
forward right so he's pushing for

20
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:35,719
forward right so he's pushing for
 

21
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,229
forward right so he's pushing for
prescription and I get out of the way he

22
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
prescription and I get out of the way he
 

23
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,869
prescription and I get out of the way he
falls forward and then I go okay the

24
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
falls forward and then I go okay the
 

25
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,790
falls forward and then I go okay the
downside of that is I'm not actually in

26
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:45,800
downside of that is I'm not actually in
 

27
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,270
downside of that is I'm not actually in
control of

28
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
control of
 

29
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,350
control of
him now the inertia may be in control of

30
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,360
him now the inertia may be in control of
 

31
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,430
him now the inertia may be in control of
him but that is not the point of your

32
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,440
him but that is not the point of your
 

33
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,389
him but that is not the point of your
Keon waza okay it's not someone's coming

34
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:55,399
Keon waza okay it's not someone's coming
 

35
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,150
Keon waza okay it's not someone's coming
at you get out of the way like a bull

36
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,160
at you get out of the way like a bull
 

37
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,189
at you get out of the way like a bull
fighter gets out of the way okay

38
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
fighter gets out of the way okay
 

39
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,910
fighter gets out of the way okay
uh and it's hard to see that when I'm

40
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
uh and it's hard to see that when I'm
 

41
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,190
uh and it's hard to see that when I'm
doing my stuff that I'm I'm in his

42
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
doing my stuff that I'm I'm in his
 

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,030
doing my stuff that I'm I'm in his
Center he he can feel it you see he can

44
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,040
Center he he can feel it you see he can
 

45
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,789
Center he he can feel it you see he can
feel it he could feel it but you can't

46
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
feel it he could feel it but you can't
 

47
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,630
feel it he could feel it but you can't
see it okay and so it's very easy that

48
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
see it okay and so it's very easy that
 

49
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,870
see it okay and so it's very easy that
when I come back here it looks like

50
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:19,880
when I come back here it looks like
 

51
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,670
when I come back here it looks like
that but I'll show you I'll show you

52
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
that but I'll show you I'll show you
 

53
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,230
that but I'll show you I'll show you
what to look for okay so for example if

54
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
what to look for okay so for example if
 

55
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,350
what to look for okay so for example if
I just get out of the

56
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,360
I just get out of the
 

57
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,550
I just get out of the
way got it

58
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
way got it
 

59
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,149
way got it
on this if I were to

60
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
on this if I were to
 

61
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,870
on this if I were to
stop he would be able to push it push it

62
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
stop he would be able to push it push it
 

63
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,749
stop he would be able to push it push it
in if I'm just getting out of the way or

64
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
in if I'm just getting out of the way or
 

65
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,550
in if I'm just getting out of the way or
if he's faster than me you got it and I

66
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:41,560
if he's faster than me you got it and I
 

67
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,230
if he's faster than me you got it and I
get out of the way you see it got stuck

68
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
get out of the way you see it got stuck
 

69
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,270
get out of the way you see it got stuck
you guys see that okay but when I am

70
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
you guys see that okay but when I am
 

71
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,670
you guys see that okay but when I am
moving his Center I you could stop at

72
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
moving his Center I you could stop at
 

73
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,630
moving his Center I you could stop at
any point push doesn't change it it

74
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
any point push doesn't change it it
 

75
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,670
any point push doesn't change it it
makes him move doesn't change it we'll

76
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
makes him move doesn't change it we'll
 

77
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,550
makes him move doesn't change it we'll
go over here push makes him move do you

78
00:01:59,550 --> 00:01:59,560
go over here push makes him move do you
 

79
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,510
go over here push makes him move do you
see so when I go around it's not that

80
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
see so when I go around it's not that
 

81
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,469
see so when I go around it's not that
I'm getting out of the way I have his

82
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:05,479
I'm getting out of the way I have his
 

83
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,790
I'm getting out of the way I have his
Center and his whole Center is making a

84
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
Center and his whole Center is making a
 

85
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,309
Center and his whole Center is making a
big

86
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319

 

87
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,550

circle okay so

88
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
circle okay so
 

89
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,110
circle okay so
now I gave you one metric he can't push

90
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,120
now I gave you one metric he can't push
 

91
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,430
now I gave you one metric he can't push
on it it would be it's pushing him back

92
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440
on it it would be it's pushing him back
 

93
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,910
on it it would be it's pushing him back
okay but the next one I want you to do

94
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:28,920
okay but the next one I want you to do
 

95
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,670
okay but the next one I want you to do
is now watch is Center okay so don't

96
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
is now watch is Center okay so don't
 

97
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,790
is now watch is Center okay so don't
don't get caught in the flash of the

98
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
don't get caught in the flash of the
 

99
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,630
don't get caught in the flash of the
hand work don't get caught in the flash

100
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
hand work don't get caught in the flash
 

101
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,390
hand work don't get caught in the flash
of the throat you're you're looking

102
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,400
of the throat you're you're looking
 

103
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,070
of the throat you're you're looking
here okay and when I just get out of the

104
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
here okay and when I just get out of the
 

105
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,750
here okay and when I just get out of the
way you see nothing really happens to

106
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
way you see nothing really happens to
 

107
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,750
way you see nothing really happens to
that Center except for the fact that it

108
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
that Center except for the fact that it
 

109
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,229
that Center except for the fact that it
fell forward got it but when I do this

110
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
fell forward got it but when I do this
 

111
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,430
fell forward got it but when I do this
movement and I have this Center you see

112
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,440
movement and I have this Center you see
 

113
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,750
movement and I have this Center you see
how Center is

114
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
how Center is
 

115
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,070
how Center is
moving

116
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,080
moving
 

117
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,550
moving
so here nothing happens till you get in

118
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:05,560
so here nothing happens till you get in
 

119
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,830
so here nothing happens till you get in
there but here in the

120

there but here in the
 

121
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,030

paradoxes philosophically speaking so
for

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
for
 

171
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,189
for
example it makes sense to the

172
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
example it makes sense to the
 

173
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,830
example it makes sense to the
dichotomist mind that he's

174
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
dichotomist mind that he's
 

175
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,430

pushing and you do the bull fighter get

176
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,440
pushing and you do the bull fighter get
 

177
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,189
pushing and you do the bull fighter get
out of the way that makes sense

178
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
out of the way that makes sense
 

179
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,469
out of the way that makes sense
okay it does not make sense that I would

180
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
okay it does not make sense that I would
 

181
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,870
okay it does not make sense that I would
have uh his Center and that at these

182
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
have uh his Center and that at these
 

183
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,870
have uh his Center and that at these
weird

184
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:01,880
weird
 

185
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,150
weird
angles that he's still pushing he can't

186
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,160
angles that he's still pushing he can't
 

187
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,629
angles that he's still pushing he can't
do anything we we would be here all day

188
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:11,639

 

189
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,310

okay it also makes sense to the

190
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
okay it also makes sense to the
 

191
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,550
okay it also makes sense to the
dichotomous mind to be pushing him do

192
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
dichotomous mind to be pushing him do
 

193
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,909
dichotomous mind to be pushing him do
you see to push him over that I get a

194
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
you see to push him over that I get a
 

195
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,590
you see to push him over that I get a
skeletal alignment and then I just kind

196
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
skeletal alignment and then I just kind
 

197
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,469
skeletal alignment and then I just kind
of push him

198
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479

 

199
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,189

over

200
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,199
over
 

201
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,350
over
likewise if I'm asking you to move his

202
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
likewise if I'm asking you to move his
 

203
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,350
likewise if I'm asking you to move his
Center it makes sense on the in hand to

204
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360

 

205
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,590

pull so you're like okay I'll pull him

206
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
pull so you're like okay I'll pull him
 

207
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,430
pull so you're like okay I'll pull him
in with that Yin hand and that makes

208
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
in with that Yin hand and that makes
 

209
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,670
in with that Yin hand and that makes
sense to you but it's really this hand

210
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
sense to you but it's really this hand
 

211
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,390
sense to you but it's really this hand
that's

212
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400

 

213
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,990

important okay so here this was in your

214
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
important okay so here this was in your
 

215
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,110
important okay so here this was in your
mind either you're getting out of the

216
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,120
mind either you're getting out of the
 

217
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,629
mind either you're getting out of the
way hand or your pushing hand do you see

218
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:01,639
way hand or your pushing hand do you see
 

219
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,950
way hand or your pushing hand do you see
that but it's going to do both so it

220
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
that but it's going to do both so it
 

221
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,270
that but it's going to do both so it
it's going to move his center around

222
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
it's going to move his center around
 

223
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,749
it's going to move his center around
this

224
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:10,759

 

225
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,510

way keep your

226
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
way keep your
 

227
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:23,550
way keep your
grip you

228
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:23,560

 

229
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,390

see you get that it's not that I'm going

230
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400

 

231
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,909

here it's moving

232
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:36,919

 

233
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,150

him that way it's

234
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160

 

235
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,309

both projecting and

236
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:45,319
both projecting and
 

237
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,350
both projecting and
adhering okay so that so don't get so

238
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
adhering okay so that so don't get so
 

239
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,629
adhering okay so that so don't get so
stuck cuz you're over here and you're

240
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
stuck cuz you're over here and you're
 

241
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,629
stuck cuz you're over here and you're
like I am moving it but this hand's just

242
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
like I am moving it but this hand's just
 

243
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,189
like I am moving it but this hand's just
waiting do you see and he's not doing

244
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
waiting do you see and he's not doing
 

245
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,309
waiting do you see and he's not doing
anything till it makes sense to now push

246
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
anything till it makes sense to now push
 

247
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,710
anything till it makes sense to now push
him over

248
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
him over
 

249
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,350
him over
okay likewise all although this hand is

250
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,360
okay likewise all although this hand is
 

251
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,029
okay likewise all although this hand is
moving him again the same thing here's a

252
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,039
moving him again the same thing here's a
 

253
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,830
moving him again the same thing here's a
weird angle push on it push on it that

254
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
weird angle push on it push on it that
 

255
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,189
weird angle push on it push on it that
way we're we're not going anywhere we're

256
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:14,199
way we're we're not going anywhere we're
 

257
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,189
way we're we're not going anywhere we're
not going

258
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
not going
 

259
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,749
not going
anywhere do you get it it's not getting

260
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
anywhere do you get it it's not getting
 

261
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,790
anywhere do you get it it's not getting
out of the way and pulling

262
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:21,800
out of the way and pulling
 

263
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,550
out of the way and pulling
him such that if he pulls it back

264
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560
him such that if he pulls it back
 

265
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,430
him such that if he pulls it back
doesn't do anything it's stuck he pushes

266
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
doesn't do anything it's stuck he pushes
 

267
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,110
doesn't do anything it's stuck he pushes
it doesn't do anything do you see that

268
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
it doesn't do anything do you see that
 

269
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,230
it doesn't do anything do you see that
okay so pay attention you're not not

270
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
okay so pay attention you're not not
 

271
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,869
okay so pay attention you're not not
getting out of the way all this hand not

272
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:37,879
getting out of the way all this hand not
 

273
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,430
getting out of the way all this hand not
doing anything until it makes

274
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
doing anything until it makes
 

275
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,390
doing anything until it makes
dichotomous sense to push them

276
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
dichotomous sense to push them
 

277
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:53,189
dichotomous sense to push them
over the whole body

278
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199

 

279
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,309

moves move his whole

280
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

281
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,550

body

282
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560

 

283
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,909

okay try it

284
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919

 

285
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,110

again all right

286
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,120

 

287
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,670

so regular Co C DOA as I said before we

288
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
so regular Co C DOA as I said before we
 

289
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,149
so regular Co C DOA as I said before we
did the first instructional period it's

290
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:17,159
did the first instructional period it's
 

291
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,749
did the first instructional period it's
like it kind of looks like it you know

292
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
like it kind of looks like it you know
 

293
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,749
like it kind of looks like it you know
what I mean like this kind of looks like

294
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
what I mean like this kind of looks like
 

295
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,629
what I mean like this kind of looks like
get out of the way it kind of looks it

296
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:23,639
get out of the way it kind of looks it
 

297
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,670
get out of the way it kind of looks it
kind of looks like it until you know

298
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
kind of looks like it until you know
 

299
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,589
kind of looks like it until you know
what to look for like the center or till

300
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
what to look for like the center or till
 

301
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,950
what to look for like the center or till
you know what to test for push push

302
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:31,960
you know what to test for push push
 

303
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,589
you know what to test for push push
we're not going anywhere pull we're not

304
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
we're not going anywhere pull we're not
 

305
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,269
we're not going anywhere pull we're not
going anywhere

306
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
going anywhere
 

307
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,310
going anywhere
okay then once you know what to look

308
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
okay then once you know what to look
 

309
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,509
okay then once you know what to look
for what to test for then it's

310
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
for what to test for then it's
 

311
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,269
for what to test for then it's
hard to lie to ourselves

312
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:46,279

 

313
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,509

okay but what I like to do is eventually

314
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
okay but what I like to do is eventually
 

315
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,509
okay but what I like to do is eventually
we'll do a version that you just can't

316
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:52,519
we'll do a version that you just can't
 

317
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,550
we'll do a version that you just can't
do the other way okay so that's what

318
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,560
do the other way okay so that's what
 

319
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,389
do the other way okay so that's what
we're going to do now you're probably

320
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:57,399
we're going to do now you're probably
 

321
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,550
we're going to do now you're probably
going to have to scoop back okay okay so

322
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
going to have to scoop back okay okay so
 

323
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,630
going to have to scoop back okay okay so
this one I'm I'm going to have his

324
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
this one I'm I'm going to have his
 

325
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:16,190
this one I'm I'm going to have his
Center I'm going to move his whole

326
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,200

 

327
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:28,110

Center send them right back the other

328
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,120

 

329
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:49,829

way

330
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839

 

331
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,150

okay let's try it okay why this works as

332
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
okay let's try it okay why this works as
 

333
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,030
okay let's try it okay why this works as
a kind of test is I can't just get out

334
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,040
a kind of test is I can't just get out
 

335
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,630
a kind of test is I can't just get out
of the way CU he'll never turn okay so I

336
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
of the way CU he'll never turn okay so I
 

337
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,389
of the way CU he'll never turn okay so I
I have to I have to control his Center

338
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:05,399
I have to I have to control his Center
 

339
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,430
I have to I have to control his Center
you see and we go we'll go over here and

340
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:08,440
you see and we go we'll go over here and
 

341
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:27,790
you see and we go we'll go over here and
then I

342
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:27,800

 

343
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,990

turn there's there's a couple things to

344
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
turn there's there's a couple things to
 

345
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,069
turn there's there's a couple things to
notice to make sure that you're not half

346
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
notice to make sure that you're not half
 

347
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,389
notice to make sure that you're not half
assing it one is not t you

348
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
assing it one is not t you
 

349
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,230
assing it one is not t you
net it remains clo you

350
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,240
net it remains clo you
 

351
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,670
net it remains clo you
net and then

352
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
net and then
 

353
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,430
net and then
two is not going to go here you see that

354
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,440
two is not going to go here you see that
 

355
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,269
two is not going to go here you see that
he's kind of there you get it and then

356
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
he's kind of there you get it and then
 

357
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,910
he's kind of there you get it and then
now he's going this way

358
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
now he's going this way
 

359
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,389
now he's going this way
there you going totally turn

360
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399

 

361
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,030

him

362
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040
him
 

363
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:06,230
him
and

364
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240

 

365
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,030

and uh a way you know you're in the

366
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,040
and uh a way you know you're in the
 

367
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,590
and uh a way you know you're in the
ballpark is the baduk is Will clamshell

368
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,600
ballpark is the baduk is Will clamshell
 

369
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,910
ballpark is the baduk is Will clamshell
on you can you I won't clamshell you but

370
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
on you can you I won't clamshell you but
 

371
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,509
on you can you I won't clamshell you but
can you show what clam shell

372
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,519
can you show what clam shell
 

373
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,470
can you show what clam shell
is yeah so he's he's like this

374
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:21,480
is yeah so he's he's like this
 

375
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,470
is yeah so he's he's like this
okay so you clam shell someone you could

376
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
okay so you clam shell someone you could
 

377
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,550
okay so you clam shell someone you could
for at least one rep go ah I'm doing it

378
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:27,560
for at least one rep go ah I'm doing it
 

379
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,430
for at least one rep go ah I'm doing it
okay but you should try to work with

380
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:30,440
okay but you should try to work with
 

381
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,790
okay but you should try to work with
your UK so I'll move him around you see

382
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
your UK so I'll move him around you see
 

383
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,750
your UK so I'll move him around you see
and then I can ease up and use the clam

384
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
and then I can ease up and use the clam
 

385
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,710
and then I can ease up and use the clam
shell just don't take him to here and

386
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:41,720
shell just don't take him to here and
 

387
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,710
shell just don't take him to here and
then think you're doing

388
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:43,720
then think you're doing
 

389
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,069
then think you're doing
[Music]

390
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:45,079
[Music]
 

391
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,550
[Music]
it if you pay attention he's going to

392
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:47,560
it if you pay attention he's going to
 

393
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,110
it if you pay attention he's going to
move all the way over to there and then

394
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,120
move all the way over to there and then
 

395
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,870
move all the way over to there and then
you can see the risk of the

396
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:51,880
you can see the risk of the
 

397
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,710
you can see the risk of the
clamshell okay let's try it

398
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:57,720

 

399
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,829

again okay so you have a technique where

400
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839
again okay so you have a technique where
 

401
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,030
again okay so you have a technique where
you're uh do this technique in dto you

402
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,040
you're uh do this technique in dto you
 

403
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,790
you're uh do this technique in dto you
so you're you get his Center boom and

404
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
so you're you get his Center boom and
 

405
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,910
so you're you get his Center boom and
you'll have his shoulders locked okay I

406
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
you'll have his shoulders locked okay I
 

407
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,910
you'll have his shoulders locked okay I
I do that at first you see and then I

408
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:12,920
I do that at first you see and then I
 

409
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,069
I do that at first you see and then I
now I just want his Ted in and I'm going

410
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:15,079
now I just want his Ted in and I'm going
 

411
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:21,750
now I just want his Ted in and I'm going
to move his tonen

412
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760

 

413
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,710

around so I'm not going like this cuz

414
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:25,720
around so I'm not going like this cuz
 

415
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,509
around so I'm not going like this cuz
this hand was dead you pay attention is

416
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:28,519
this hand was dead you pay attention is
 

417
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,470
this hand was dead you pay attention is
dead

418
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,480
dead
 

419
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,150
dead
hand down

420
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160

 

421
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,030

here so you're going to pass through AAG

422
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,040
here so you're going to pass through AAG
 

423
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,750
here so you're going to pass through AAG
and then once you have the center you

424
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
and then once you have the center you
 

425
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:49,069
and then once you have the center you
turn

426
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,079

 

427
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,310

it this is why it's not teni

428
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
it this is why it's not teni
 

429
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,870
it this is why it's not teni
nugget this hand's

430
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880

 

431
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:27,509

dead Bo

432
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519

 

433
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,670

okay and we're not taking them to the

434
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
okay and we're not taking them to the
 

435
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,990
okay and we're not taking them to the
left or right R turning him all

436
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000

 

437
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:49,990

here boom okay try it

438
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000

 

439
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,509

again A lot of times you have this idea

440
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
again A lot of times you have this idea
 

441
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,629
again A lot of times you have this idea
of move your Center really amounts to

442
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
of move your Center really amounts to
 

443
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,590
of move your Center really amounts to
people turning their waist okay but we

444
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
people turning their waist okay but we
 

445
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,230
people turning their waist okay but we
don't ever turn the way so I do have

446
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
don't ever turn the way so I do have
 

447
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,949
don't ever turn the way so I do have
some Center realignment but it's from

448
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
some Center realignment but it's from
 

449
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,310
some Center realignment but it's from
the qua moving the qua opening and

450
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
the qua moving the qua opening and
 

451
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,509
the qua moving the qua opening and
closing I don't ever go like this this

452
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
closing I don't ever go like this this
 

453
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,990
closing I don't ever go like this this
is incorrect okay but people can get

454
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
is incorrect okay but people can get
 

455
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,189
is incorrect okay but people can get
very uh uh strong or powerful by just

456
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
very uh uh strong or powerful by just
 

457
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,069
very uh uh strong or powerful by just
having the biomechanics of moving from

458
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
having the biomechanics of moving from
 

459
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,470
having the biomechanics of moving from
the core of your body okay but then

460
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
the core of your body okay but then
 

461
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,189
the core of your body okay but then
people mistake that as correct

462
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
people mistake that as correct
 

463
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,470
people mistake that as correct
form so you see uh use your Center okay

464
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,480
form so you see uh use your Center okay
 

465
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,949
form so you see uh use your Center okay
so I I go in here you see my Center is

466
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:33,959
so I I go in here you see my Center is
 

467
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,990
so I I go in here you see my Center is
going up and then they'll turn their

468
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,000
going up and then they'll turn their
 

469
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,509
going up and then they'll turn their
waist you see and then they turn their

470
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
waist you see and then they turn their
 

471
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,749
waist you see and then they turn their
waist

472
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:40,759
waist
 

473
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,749
waist
back I haven't done that in a long time

474
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:43,759
back I haven't done that in a long time
 

475
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,310
back I haven't done that in a long time
man that felt weird that it's that's a

476
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
man that felt weird that it's that's a
 

477
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,110
man that felt weird that it's that's a
lot of strain on the other side to do it

478
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,120
lot of strain on the other side to do it
 

479
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,550
lot of strain on the other side to do it
okay um but here's the thing you're

480
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
okay um but here's the thing you're
 

481
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,430
okay um but here's the thing you're
trying to spiral rotate the

482
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
trying to spiral rotate the
 

483
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,230
trying to spiral rotate the
tanden but once you form the Tom Den

484
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,240
tanden but once you form the Tom Den
 

485
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,829
tanden but once you form the Tom Den
it's not because I actually physically

486
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
it's not because I actually physically
 

487
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,710
it's not because I actually physically
turn my waist that I would ever spir

488
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
turn my waist that I would ever spir
 

489
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,590
turn my waist that I would ever spir
rotate this the hands are actually

490
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:12,600
rotate this the hands are actually
 

491
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,670
rotate this the hands are actually
rotating the Yoni in my tanden okay so

492
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
rotating the Yoni in my tanden okay so
 

493
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,710
rotating the Yoni in my tanden okay so
my my hands

494
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
my my hands
 

495
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,509
my my hands
boom one

496
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:24,519

 

497
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,590

low one

498
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
low one
 

499
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,230
low one
high

500
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240

 

501
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,269

okay and then over the top

502
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
okay and then over the top
 

503
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,110
okay and then over the top
drop so I can't do whatever I want with

504
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,120
drop so I can't do whatever I want with
 

505
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,910
drop so I can't do whatever I want with
my hands my hands have to spiral rotate

506
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:42,920
my hands my hands have to spiral rotate
 

507
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,910
my hands my hands have to spiral rotate
the hands have to spiral rotate they

508
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
the hands have to spiral rotate they
 

509
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,710
the hands have to spiral rotate they
can't make these circles like that you

510
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
can't make these circles like that you
 

511
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,350
can't make these circles like that you
see circles those are conducive to waist

512
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,360
see circles those are conducive to waist
 

513
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,189
see circles those are conducive to waist
movement okay and they always stress

514
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
movement okay and they always stress
 

515
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,509
movement okay and they always stress
your inner

516
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:56,519
your inner
 

517
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,389
your inner
deltoid to martially they're not going

518
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399
deltoid to martially they're not going
 

519
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,829
deltoid to martially they're not going
to function unless they're this person's

520
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
to function unless they're this person's
 

521
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,389
to function unless they're this person's
lighter than your strength okay but

522
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
lighter than your strength okay but
 

523
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,790
lighter than your strength okay but
they'll never spiral rotate the lower T

524
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
they'll never spiral rotate the lower T
 

525
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,150
they'll never spiral rotate the lower T
then okay so as you're doing the

526
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,160
then okay so as you're doing the
 

527
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,030
then okay so as you're doing the
technique okay you're going to watch how

528
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
technique okay you're going to watch how
 

529
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,870
technique okay you're going to watch how
I'm doing an inward

530
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880

 

531
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,309

spiral if you're not sure how to

532
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:21,319
spiral if you're not sure how to
 

533
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,590
spiral if you're not sure how to
recognize that

534
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
recognize that
 

535
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,309
recognize that
think okay so I go like

536
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:27,319
think okay so I go like
 

537
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,749
think okay so I go like
this that that's not it you see

538
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
this that that's not it you see
 

539
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,269
this that that's not it you see
that okay and I go like

540
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279

 

541
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,990

this that's not

542
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000

 

543
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,069

it

544
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:47,079

 

545
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:56,269

Bo so without him no no no

546
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:56,279
Bo so without him no no no
 

547
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,990
Bo so without him no no no
no no

548
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,000
no no
 

549
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,870
no no
okay so watch the Y hand in the

550
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
okay so watch the Y hand in the
 

551
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,990
okay so watch the Y hand in the
technique and it's going to

552
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000

 

553
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750

do

554
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
do
 

555
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,909
do
okay then the lower hand so it's a Yin

556
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:14,919
okay then the lower hand so it's a Yin
 

557
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,710
okay then the lower hand so it's a Yin
Yong world so as I do the inward spiral

558
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
Yong world so as I do the inward spiral
 

559
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,669
Yong world so as I do the inward spiral
on the Yang hand

560
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
on the Yang hand
 

561
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,750
on the Yang hand
right until it gets to that Yang phase

562
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:24,760
right until it gets to that Yang phase
 

563
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,150
right until it gets to that Yang phase
what do you think you have over here you

564
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,160
what do you think you have over here you
 

565
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,430
what do you think you have over here you
have the EM spiral you

566
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
have the EM spiral you
 

567
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,070
have the EM spiral you
see so as I go and you pay attention

568
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,080
see so as I go and you pay attention
 

569
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,430
see so as I go and you pay attention
this is actually the hour spiral do you

570
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
this is actually the hour spiral do you
 

571
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,950
this is actually the hour spiral do you
see it right

572
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
see it right
 

573
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,350
see it right
there if you're not sure what it looks

574
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
there if you're not sure what it looks
 

575
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,310
there if you're not sure what it looks
like you can see it in cooku

576
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,320

 

577
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,150

hole so as I go one I'm picking it up

578
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,160
hole so as I go one I'm picking it up
 

579
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,870
hole so as I go one I'm picking it up
with the outward spiral and then as I

580
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:51,880
with the outward spiral and then as I
 

581
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,470
with the outward spiral and then as I
reach its limal stage that's when it

582
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:55,480
reach its limal stage that's when it
 

583
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,230
reach its limal stage that's when it
converts to the inward spiral do you see

584
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
converts to the inward spiral do you see
 

585
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,190
converts to the inward spiral do you see
that

586
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
that
 

587
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,350
that
so I am from the bottom picking up so to

588
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
so I am from the bottom picking up so to
 

589
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,789
so I am from the bottom picking up so to
speak the lower toen and then over the

590
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
speak the lower toen and then over the
 

591
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,710
speak the lower toen and then over the
top spiraling

592
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
top spiraling
 

593
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,270
top spiraling
in

594
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,280
in
 

595
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,789
in
okay this hand will do

596
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:15,799
okay this hand will do
 

597
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,430
okay this hand will do
the

598
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
the
 

599
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,270
the
inverse so it's going to do the inverse

600
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
inverse so it's going to do the inverse
 

601
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,070
inverse so it's going to do the inverse
spiral and it's over the top of the

602
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
spiral and it's over the top of the
 

603
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,870
spiral and it's over the top of the
tanden until he starts to come back and

604
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
tanden until he starts to come back and
 

605
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,870
tanden until he starts to come back and
here is your outward spiral do you see

606
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
here is your outward spiral do you see
 

607
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,070
here is your outward spiral do you see
boom so now watch this hand it does the

608
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
boom so now watch this hand it does the
 

609
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:45,190
boom so now watch this hand it does the
inward W pop back

610
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200

 

611
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,549

out okay so if I move out of the

612
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
out okay so if I move out of the
 

613
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,390
out okay so if I move out of the
way

614
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,400
way
 

615
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,950
way
oh this is where I am moving this thing

616
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
oh this is where I am moving this thing
 

617
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,350
oh this is where I am moving this thing
