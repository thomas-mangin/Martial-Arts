1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:05,450

okay so yesterday we you're doing you're

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,460
okay so yesterday we you're doing you're
 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,340
okay so yesterday we you're doing you're
doing the out this is actually the

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,350
doing the out this is actually the
 

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,879
doing the out this is actually the
outward spiral okay my hand although my

6
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:10,889
outward spiral okay my hand although my
 

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,970
outward spiral okay my hand although my
elbows going in that our spiral is is

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:13,980
elbows going in that our spiral is is
 

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:28,939
elbows going in that our spiral is is
going to go that way so for example

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:28,949

 

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,590

getting y'all concept if the technique

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,600
getting y'all concept if the technique
 

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,139
getting y'all concept if the technique
overall is yielding there's got to be a

14
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:37,149
overall is yielding there's got to be a
 

15
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,209
overall is yielding there's got to be a
little bit of young into it so as the

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:42,219
little bit of young into it so as the
 

17
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,310
little bit of young into it so as the
technique is the outer spiral there's

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
technique is the outer spiral there's
 

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,889
technique is the outer spiral there's
going to be a little inward spiral to it

20
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:46,899
going to be a little inward spiral to it
 

21
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,100
going to be a little inward spiral to it
do you understand so the hip was going

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,110
do you understand so the hip was going
 

23
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,759
do you understand so the hip was going
in and the elbow was going down okay

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:53,769
in and the elbow was going down okay
 

25
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,579
in and the elbow was going down okay
now let's work on the inner spiral and

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:56,589
now let's work on the inner spiral and
 

27
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:01,290
now let's work on the inner spiral and
you can just reverse all that so even

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,300
you can just reverse all that so even
 

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,079
you can just reverse all that so even
though the spiral is going in the first

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,089
though the spiral is going in the first
 

31
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,870
though the spiral is going in the first
move is the hips can go back and the

32
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
move is the hips can go back and the
 

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,450
move is the hips can go back and the
elbow will go up okay

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:09,460
elbow will go up okay
 

35
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,120
elbow will go up okay
so again you'll follow the same rules

36
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,130
so again you'll follow the same rules
 

37
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,350
so again you'll follow the same rules
that the elbow is going to stay in a

38
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
that the elbow is going to stay in a
 

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,870
that the elbow is going to stay in a
kind of graceful pattern with no zigzags

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
kind of graceful pattern with no zigzags
 

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,830
kind of graceful pattern with no zigzags
and no lines across the circumference or

42
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
and no lines across the circumference or
 

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,810
and no lines across the circumference or
the radius do you know you're not doing

44
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:30,820
the radius do you know you're not doing
 

45
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,850
the radius do you know you're not doing
this kind of stuff keep your grip please

46
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:32,860
this kind of stuff keep your grip please
 

47
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,639
this kind of stuff keep your grip please
you're not doing this do you see that so

48
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:35,649
you're not doing this do you see that so
 

49
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,100
you're not doing this do you see that so
here my elbow one is straight back then

50
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,110
here my elbow one is straight back then
 

51
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,609
here my elbow one is straight back then
straight up and then turn this is too

52
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:41,619
straight up and then turn this is too
 

53
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,950
straight up and then turn this is too
jagged see that no okay also you will

54
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
jagged see that no okay also you will
 

55
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,800
jagged see that no okay also you will
not change the relationship between your

56
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:49,810
not change the relationship between your
 

57
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,429
not change the relationship between your
elbow and your ribcage got it so when

58
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
elbow and your ribcage got it so when
 

59
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,109
elbow and your ribcage got it so when
you did that when I did that last one

60
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
you did that when I did that last one
 

61
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,160
you did that when I did that last one
you see I just shrunk that area okay so

62
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,170
you see I just shrunk that area okay so
 

63
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,520
you see I just shrunk that area okay so
we're here like this and drill one is

64
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,530
we're here like this and drill one is
 

65
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,399
we're here like this and drill one is
I'm going to continue this freeing of

66
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:05,409
I'm going to continue this freeing of
 

67
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,009
I'm going to continue this freeing of
the one corner so I'm gonna free that

68
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,019
the one corner so I'm gonna free that
 

69
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,390
the one corner so I'm gonna free that
corner it's gonna go back that's the

70
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
corner it's gonna go back that's the
 

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,910
corner it's gonna go back that's the
beginning

72
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:12,920
beginning
 

73
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:28,800
beginning
oh okay let me push it hard here

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,810

 

75
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,090

so going back to the outer spiral title

76
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,100
so going back to the outer spiral title
 

77
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,670
so going back to the outer spiral title
head coat so when he's pushing remember

78
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:36,680
head coat so when he's pushing remember
 

79
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,280
head coat so when he's pushing remember
I I'm not moving him

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,290
I I'm not moving him
 

81
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,100
I I'm not moving him
I just free the corner and drop the

82
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,110
I just free the corner and drop the
 

83
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,130
I just free the corner and drop the
elbow read the corner drunk down read

84
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,140
elbow read the corner drunk down read
 

85
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,380
elbow read the corner drunk down read
the corner drop the elbow that is on

86
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,390
the corner drop the elbow that is on
 

87
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,040
the corner drop the elbow that is on
line two

88
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,050
line two
 

89
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,180
line two
he's pushing right then I'm just doing

90
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,190
he's pushing right then I'm just doing
 

91
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,560
he's pushing right then I'm just doing
that line thing so when you're here do

92
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,570
that line thing so when you're here do
 

93
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,990
that line thing so when you're here do
not move him do not move him you see

94
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
not move him do not move him you see
 

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,090
not move him do not move him you see
that difference you'll note it in your

96
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,100
that difference you'll note it in your
 

97
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,970
that difference you'll note it in your
elbow the elbow now change distance DC

98
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:11,980
elbow the elbow now change distance DC
 

99
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,220
elbow the elbow now change distance DC
so I'm not trying to move him so I don't

100
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,230
so I'm not trying to move him so I don't
 

101
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,980
so I'm not trying to move him so I don't
need to pull him I don't need to yield

102
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:17,990
need to pull him I don't need to yield
 

103
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,490
need to pull him I don't need to yield
to him I don't need to push yeah I'm

104
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:21,500
to him I don't need to push yeah I'm
 

105
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,480
to him I don't need to push yeah I'm
just here I keep this relationship he

106
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,490
just here I keep this relationship he
 

107
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,960
just here I keep this relationship he
pushes and I just do this free let's

108
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:31,970
pushes and I just do this free let's
 

109
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,510
pushes and I just do this free let's
take the elbow turn out just a corner

110
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:34,520
take the elbow turn out just a corner
 

111
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:50,850
take the elbow turn out just a corner
here

112
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:50,860

 

113
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,030

see did you were gonna feel it in your

114
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,040
see did you were gonna feel it in your
 

115
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,839
see did you were gonna feel it in your
outer dough

116
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:58,849

 

117
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:10,770

question here

118
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:10,780

 

119
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,780

HR

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:14,790

 

121
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,410

so it looks different what you're doing

122
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:19,420
so it looks different what you're doing
 

123
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,670
so it looks different what you're doing
but you don't know that but to me to my

124
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
but you don't know that but to me to my
 

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,590
but you don't know that but to me to my
eye it looks different so I'll show you

126
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
eye it looks different so I'll show you
 

127
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,460
eye it looks different so I'll show you
some things you can do okay so what it

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,470
some things you can do okay so what it
 

129
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,670
some things you can do okay so what it
looks like you're doing is more hip

130
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
looks like you're doing is more hip
 

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,610
looks like you're doing is more hip
rotation shoulder rotation and that's

132
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:38,620
rotation shoulder rotation and that's
 

133
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,130
rotation shoulder rotation and that's
why you get the pull okay so for example

134
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,140
why you get the pull okay so for example
 

135
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,590
why you get the pull okay so for example
Leah you're gonna come up you can test

136
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
Leah you're gonna come up you can test
 

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,370
Leah you're gonna come up you can test
for certain pressures okay so as he

138
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,380
for certain pressures okay so as he
 

139
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,520
for certain pressures okay so as he
pushes at just some of them as he pushes

140
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,530
pushes at just some of them as he pushes
 

141
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,870
pushes at just some of them as he pushes
right and I turn my hips like this okay

142
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
right and I turn my hips like this okay
 

143
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,670
right and I turn my hips like this okay
you can see that I'm disjointed okay so

144
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
you can see that I'm disjointed okay so
 

145
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,170
you can see that I'm disjointed okay so
when Leah comes to push on this hand

146
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,180
when Leah comes to push on this hand
 

147
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,390
when Leah comes to push on this hand
let's just push on this vector right up

148
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
let's just push on this vector right up
 

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,820
let's just push on this vector right up
my arm right up my arm it's very

150
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:14,830
my arm right up my arm it's very
 

151
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,730
my arm right up my arm it's very
difficult to hold it it'll be nearly

152
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:17,740
difficult to hold it it'll be nearly
 

153
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,150
difficult to hold it it'll be nearly
impossible for her to for me to keep it

154
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
impossible for her to for me to keep it
 

155
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,390
impossible for her to for me to keep it
up so she pushes down

156
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,400

 

157
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,879

okay and that upward miss is important

158
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:30,889
okay and that upward miss is important
 

159
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,000
okay and that upward miss is important
because remember that I'm going to turn

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,010
because remember that I'm going to turn
 

161
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:42,070
because remember that I'm going to turn
my elbow around this way okay so when I

162
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
my elbow around this way okay so when I
 

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,100
my elbow around this way okay so when I
go here he cannot stop me from lifting

164
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,110
go here he cannot stop me from lifting
 

165
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:56,800
go here he cannot stop me from lifting
that half push down so technique if I go

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:56,810
that half push down so technique if I go
 

167
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,310
that half push down so technique if I go
here and we should sound because that

168
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
here and we should sound because that
 

169
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,689
here and we should sound because that
from that elbow out you see but if I go

170
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:04,699
from that elbow out you see but if I go
 

171
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,879
from that elbow out you see but if I go
here this hand becomes liftable so why

172
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:09,889
here this hand becomes liftable so why
 

173
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,570
here this hand becomes liftable so why
because I come in off on his stuff side

174
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:12,580
because I come in off on his stuff side
 

175
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,719
because I come in off on his stuff side
you see I'm coming in on this look how

176
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:16,729
you see I'm coming in on this look how
 

177
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,550
you see I'm coming in on this look how
awkward that is for pushing down

178
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
awkward that is for pushing down
 

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,279
awkward that is for pushing down
something you wouldn't do that you would

180
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,289
something you wouldn't do that you would
 

181
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,680
something you wouldn't do that you would
you would want to push down here

182
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:24,690
you would want to push down here
 

183
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,200
you would want to push down here
so when you turn your body and then you

184
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,210
so when you turn your body and then you
 

185
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,370
so when you turn your body and then you
turn to help us down you get - and

186
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:31,380
turn to help us down you get - and
 

187
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,860
turn to help us down you get - and
that's exactly what needs to push down

188
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:33,870
that's exactly what needs to push down
 

189
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,250
that's exactly what needs to push down
which is what you guys get a lot of when

190
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,260
which is what you guys get a lot of when
 

191
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,330
which is what you guys get a lot of when
you do it wrong do wrong because that's

192
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,340
you do it wrong do wrong because that's
 

193
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,470
you do it wrong do wrong because that's
a unit you see so I can't do that so I

194
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,480
a unit you see so I can't do that so I
 

195
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,850
a unit you see so I can't do that so I
just same way things smaller smaller

196
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
just same way things smaller smaller
 

197
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:58,250
just same way things smaller smaller
smaller not okay very small and I turn

198
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,260
smaller not okay very small and I turn
 

199
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:24,840
smaller not okay very small and I turn
my elbow

200
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:24,850

 

201
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,610

and since he's never really on it my

202
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:29,620
and since he's never really on it my
 

203
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,550
and since he's never really on it my
arms can be relaxed all I have to do is

204
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
arms can be relaxed all I have to do is
 

205
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,250
arms can be relaxed all I have to do is
always feel for his Center maintain zero

206
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,260
always feel for his Center maintain zero
 

207
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,620
always feel for his Center maintain zero
pressure I'm not on the positive or the

208
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,630
pressure I'm not on the positive or the
 

209
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,440
pressure I'm not on the positive or the
negative side and then move from my

210
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,450
negative side and then move from my
 

211
00:07:40,450 --> 00:08:05,340
negative side and then move from my
centers

212
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,350

 

213
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,730

kind of shrink everything but you can't

214
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:12,740
kind of shrink everything but you can't
 

215
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:30,780
kind of shrink everything but you can't
just shove into it hey let's try so you

216
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:30,790
just shove into it hey let's try so you
 

217
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:41,170
just shove into it hey let's try so you
are not simply changing his skeletal

218
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,180
are not simply changing his skeletal
 

219
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,220
are not simply changing his skeletal
alignment see so I asked him okay

220
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,230
alignment see so I asked him okay
 

221
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,270
alignment see so I asked him okay
and then I do stuff with his arm and so

222
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:52,280
and then I do stuff with his arm and so
 

223
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,040
and then I do stuff with his arm and so
I could get away with these kind of

224
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,050
I could get away with these kind of
 

225
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,580
I could get away with these kind of
shapes you see that so you know like but

226
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,590
shapes you see that so you know like but
 

227
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,500
shapes you see that so you know like but
that's not the sound that's not

228
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,510
that's not the sound that's not
 

229
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,380
that's not the sound that's not
mechanically sound you can feel it if

230
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,390
mechanically sound you can feel it if
 

231
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,060
mechanically sound you can feel it if
you're honest and you're all going in

232
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,070
you're honest and you're all going in
 

233
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,050
you're honest and you're all going in
your tricep also it's not tactically

234
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,060
your tricep also it's not tactically
 

235
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,330
your tricep also it's not tactically
sound because the guy had and a bulldog

236
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,340
sound because the guy had and a bulldog
 

237
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,150
sound because the guy had and a bulldog
hold on to you in order for you to do

238
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
hold on to you in order for you to do
 

239
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,940
hold on to you in order for you to do
that okay so kind of like yesterday's

240
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:18,950
that okay so kind of like yesterday's
 

241
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,260
that okay so kind of like yesterday's
training in some way his basic support

242
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,270
training in some way his basic support
 

243
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,390
training in some way his basic support
is being immobilized or taken away from

244
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,400
is being immobilized or taken away from
 

245
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,690
is being immobilized or taken away from
his control so that when I create the

246
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:31,700
his control so that when I create the
 

247
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,720
his control so that when I create the
angle of disturbance he can not so

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:34,730
angle of disturbance he can not so
 

249
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,640
angle of disturbance he can not so
readily regain his balance okay so in

250
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:39,650
readily regain his balance okay so in
 

251
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,910
readily regain his balance okay so in
this technique he was tasked with the

252
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,920
this technique he was tasked with the
 

253
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,750
this technique he was tasked with the
initial push so he's coming forward I'm

254
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:46,760
initial push so he's coming forward I'm
 

255
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,970
initial push so he's coming forward I'm
gonna keep that going full

256
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:48,980
gonna keep that going full
 

257
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,890
gonna keep that going full
because a little forward and then my

258
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:50,900
because a little forward and then my
 

259
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,540
because a little forward and then my
idle disturbance line cuts here okay so

260
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:54,550
idle disturbance line cuts here okay so
 

261
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:03,670
idle disturbance line cuts here okay so
he's going forward and I push I am NOT

262
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
he's going forward and I push I am NOT
 

263
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,730
he's going forward and I push I am NOT
going to when I'd go like SEC he's not

264
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:06,740
going to when I'd go like SEC he's not
 

265
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,790
going to when I'd go like SEC he's not
coming full he's going up you see and

266
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:09,800
coming full he's going up you see and
 

267
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,910
coming full he's going up you see and
then I'm doing this well what if he let

268
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:12,920
then I'm doing this well what if he let
 

269
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,750
then I'm doing this well what if he let
go and just come in now you're whole lot

270
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:16,760
go and just come in now you're whole lot
 

271
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,670
go and just come in now you're whole lot
of okay so you wanted to keep going

272
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:20,680
of okay so you wanted to keep going
 

273
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,100
of okay so you wanted to keep going
forward so this movement you see he's

274
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,110
forward so this movement you see he's
 

275
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,590
forward so this movement you see he's
going forward but I'm going to turn it

276
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:26,600
going forward but I'm going to turn it
 

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,030
going forward but I'm going to turn it
I'm gonna make it go to this side and my

278
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm gonna make it go to this side and my
 

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm gonna make it go to this side and my
projection then has to be of such a

280
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:34,850
projection then has to be of such a
 

281
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,120
projection then has to be of such a
nature that does not stop him from going

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,130
nature that does not stop him from going
 

283
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,470
nature that does not stop him from going
forward so you are not going like this

284
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,480
forward so you are not going like this
 

285
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,550
forward so you are not going like this
and you push them back down you see you

286
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:45,560
and you push them back down you see you
 

287
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,130
and you push them back down you see you
have to go I do feel the center but I

288
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,140
have to go I do feel the center but I
 

289
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,660
have to go I do feel the center but I
have to go over the top of it both

290
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:52,670
have to go over the top of it both
 

291
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,210
have to go over the top of it both
vectors ours is not that he needs to

292
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,220
vectors ours is not that he needs to
 

293
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,180
vectors ours is not that he needs to
travel but his inertia needs to be on

294
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,190
travel but his inertia needs to be on
 

295
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,170
travel but his inertia needs to be on
that vector

296
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,180
that vector
 

297
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,110
that vector
do you understand so he's pushing really

298
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,120
do you understand so he's pushing really
 

299
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,170
do you understand so he's pushing really
hard right and you see how he's coming

300
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,180
hard right and you see how he's coming
 

301
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,250
hard right and you see how he's coming
in that

302
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,260
in that
 

303
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,970
in that
so there's energy there I don't let it

304
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:09,980
so there's energy there I don't let it
 

305
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,210
so there's energy there I don't let it
go that far but I need to make sure it

306
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,220
go that far but I need to make sure it
 

307
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,790
go that far but I need to make sure it
keeps going that way that he's tasked

308
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:15,800
keeps going that way that he's tasked
 

309
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,510
keeps going that way that he's tasked
with that inertia then as I throw back I

310
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:19,520
with that inertia then as I throw back I
 

311
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,230
with that inertia then as I throw back I
can't not push him back and stop that

312
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,240
can't not push him back and stop that
 

313
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:31,519
can't not push him back and stop that
backer okay so it's just over the top

314
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:31,529

 

315
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,449

it doesn't it's not a matter of you

316
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:35,459
it doesn't it's not a matter of you
 

317
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,850
it doesn't it's not a matter of you
actually aiming over this hop and nor

318
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:38,860
actually aiming over this hop and nor
 

319
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,430
actually aiming over this hop and nor
was it a matter of you pulling him into

320
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
was it a matter of you pulling him into
 

321
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,190
was it a matter of you pulling him into

okay they were using that point to

428
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,370
okay they were using that point to
 

429
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,600
okay they were using that point to

Aikido and not this technique so what

436
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,110

437
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,560

I'm doing instead is his energy is

438
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,570
I'm doing instead is his energy is
 

439
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,930
I'm doing instead is his energy is

440
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:55,940
coming in
 

441
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,450
coming in
and when it comes forward it hits that

442
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:58,460
and when it comes forward it hits that
 

443
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,760

deflection of the deflecting angle and
 

451
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,860
deflection of the deflecting angle and
it makes him go over okay which means

452
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,870
it makes him go over okay which means
 

453
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,760
it makes him go over okay which means
now I don't have to anything you get it

now I don't have to anything you get it
 

455
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,400
now I don't have to anything you get it
which means what's more important is the

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,870

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,620
him on the initial needed vector making
max lighter and then has him hit my

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:35,630
max lighter and then has him hit my

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,520
so if because I'm operating at an
energetic level the more energy he gives

486
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,530
energetic level the more energy he gives
 

487
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,460
energetic level the more energy he gives
me the easier everything is meaning the

488
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:16,470
me the easier everything is meaning the
 

489
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,340
me the easier everything is meaning the
more mouths will go into the forward

490
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,350
more mouths will go into the forward
 

491
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,710
more mouths will go into the forward
progress right that vector so that means

492
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
progress right that vector so that means
 

493
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,149
progress right that vector so that means
there's less mouths I wanna do the

494
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:23,159
there's less mouths I wanna do the
 

495
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:26,060
there's less mouths I wanna do the
projection point and the more energy he

496
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,070
projection point and the more energy he
 

497
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,520
projection point and the more energy he
gives me when he rebounds off of the

498
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:28,530
gives me when he rebounds off of the
 

499
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,649
gives me when he rebounds off of the
ledge there's going to be more rebound

500
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:30,659
ledge there's going to be more rebound
 

501
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,580
ledge there's going to be more rebound
but when I don't have things set up more

502
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:34,590
but when I don't have things set up more
 

503
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,840
but when I don't have things set up more
energy actually leads to energy escaping

504
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:38,850
energy actually leads to energy escaping
 

505
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:46,090
energy actually leads to energy escaping
out of that system and then I don't have

506
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,100

 

507
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,480

and so you'll see a breakdown of the

508
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,490
and so you'll see a breakdown of the
 

509
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,159
and so you'll see a breakdown of the
mechanics you were just trying to get

510
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:52,169
mechanics you were just trying to get
 

511
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,320
mechanics you were just trying to get
okay so I can you can already see that

512
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,330
okay so I can you can already see that
 

513
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,060
okay so I can you can already see that
this parts not engaged so if you paid

514
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,070
this parts not engaged so if you paid
 

515
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,520
this parts not engaged so if you paid
attention his knees wobbled because he

516
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,530
attention his knees wobbled because he
 

517
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,270
attention his knees wobbled because he
got lifted because I I gave full

518
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,280
got lifted because I I gave full
 

519
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,090
got lifted because I I gave full
pressure here just did you feel that so

520
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,100
pressure here just did you feel that so
 

521
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,970
pressure here just did you feel that so
you can already tell this is not going

522
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,980
you can already tell this is not going
 

523
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,580
you can already tell this is not going
to work right and you can see that this

524
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:16,590
to work right and you can see that this
 

525
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,880
to work right and you can see that this
collapse so once he starts the movement

526
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:19,890
collapse so once he starts the movement
 

527
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,419
collapse so once he starts the movement
and he frees the hip is too much energy

528
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:23,429
and he frees the hip is too much energy
 

529
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,799
and he frees the hip is too much energy
is too much energy

530
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:24,809
is too much energy
 

531
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:31,399
is too much energy
okay so he will resort to that we see

532
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:31,409
okay so he will resort to that we see
 

533
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,560
okay so he will resort to that we see
that he's resorting to the shoulder if

534
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,570
that he's resorting to the shoulder if
 

535
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,219
that he's resorting to the shoulder if
you could maybe hear his shoulders

536
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:37,229
you could maybe hear his shoulders
 

537
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:40,159
you could maybe hear his shoulders
because he's overstressing it right do

538
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,169
because he's overstressing it right do
 

539
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:40,969
because he's overstressing it right do
you get what I'm saying

540
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:40,979
you get what I'm saying
 

541
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:45,099
you get what I'm saying
okay so he didn't have the right

542
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:45,109
okay so he didn't have the right
 

543
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:48,169
okay so he didn't have the right
anatomical organization and then they

544
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:48,179
anatomical organization and then they
 

545
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,359
anatomical organization and then they
will resort to the attacker defender

546
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:50,369
will resort to the attacker defender
 

547
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,729
will resort to the attacker defender
mindset you'll use your external muscles

548
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:52,739
mindset you'll use your external muscles
 

549
00:19:52,739 --> 00:20:00,909
mindset you'll use your external muscles
and then you can't do the technique okay

550
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:00,919

 

551
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,430

and this time so you guys can see I want

552
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
and this time so you guys can see I want
 

553
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,699
and this time so you guys can see I want
you to note what the where the

554
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:07,709
you to note what the where the
 

555
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:18,289
you to note what the where the
organization breaks down so I go and we

556
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:18,299
organization breaks down so I go and we
 

557
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,859
organization breaks down so I go and we
add the down the down right and again

558
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:20,869
add the down the down right and again
 

559
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,589
add the down the down right and again
attention your shoulder kinked up so I'm

560
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:24,599
attention your shoulder kinked up so I'm
 

561
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,129
attention your shoulder kinked up so I'm
not pushing all that hard you see but I

562
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:28,139
not pushing all that hard you see but I
 

563
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,499
not pushing all that hard you see but I
will fill the hidden spaces that her

564
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:30,509
will fill the hidden spaces that her
 

565
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,219
will fill the hidden spaces that her
technique is created so what happened to

566
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:34,229
technique is created so what happened to
 

567
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:38,629
technique is created so what happened to
me did you see I went off balance and

568
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:38,639
me did you see I went off balance and
 

569
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,139
me did you see I went off balance and
then what went back on the switch is

570
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:42,149
then what went back on the switch is
 

571
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:46,239
then what went back on the switch is
actually giving me back my balance okay

572
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:46,249
actually giving me back my balance okay
 

573
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:49,069
actually giving me back my balance okay
Tim did you see that elbow came up like

574
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:49,079
Tim did you see that elbow came up like
 

575
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,540
Tim did you see that elbow came up like
this it's outside of frame

576
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:54,550

 

577
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,690

and again it's not very hard but I can

578
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:58,700
and again it's not very hard but I can
 

579
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,390
and again it's not very hard but I can
already see you extending like this you

580
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,400
already see you extending like this you
 

581
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
already see you extending like this you
see that you already don't want me leave

582
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,010
see that you already don't want me leave
 

583
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,970
see that you already don't want me leave
now so you all you came in with the

584
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:06,980
now so you all you came in with the
 

585
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,600
now so you all you came in with the
attacker defender of dichotomy do you

586
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:10,610
attacker defender of dichotomy do you
 

587
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,940
attacker defender of dichotomy do you
understand anything okay so we go and

588
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:14,950
understand anything okay so we go and
 

589
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,420
understand anything okay so we go and
then you're going to lose that one right

590
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,430
then you're going to lose that one right
 

591
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,760
then you're going to lose that one right
why because your levers in the wrong

592
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:21,770
why because your levers in the wrong
 

593
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:30,870
why because your levers in the wrong
place so you and now as you turn it down

594
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
place so you and now as you turn it down
 

595
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,600
place so you and now as you turn it down
when you try to push me out you actually

596
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:34,610
when you try to push me out you actually
 

597
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,810
when you try to push me out you actually
put me at a disability and I have them

598
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:37,820
put me at a disability and I have them
 

599
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,140
put me at a disability and I have them
accounted for damage okay so you're

600
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,150
accounted for damage okay so you're
 

601
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,080
accounted for damage okay so you're
still pushing me out do you understand

602
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,090
still pushing me out do you understand
 

603
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:57,710
still pushing me out do you understand
so so what I moved

604
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720

 

605
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,800

so I hear all the time

606
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:01,810
so I hear all the time
 

607
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:10,190
so I hear all the time
don't I don't have enough energy

608
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,200

 

609
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,249

you can you push that now but I'm not

610
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:16,259
you can you push that now but I'm not
 

611
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,090
you can you push that now but I'm not
doing this

612
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,100
doing this
 

613
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:34,050
doing this
I just need me for

614
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,060

 

615
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,950

together difference already so it's

616
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
together difference already so it's
 

617
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:49,450
together difference already so it's
still

618
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,460

 

619
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,780

so how how much forward has look look at

620
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:52,790
so how how much forward has look look at
 

621
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,730
so how how much forward has look look at
don't don't

622
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:54,740
don't don't
 

623
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,400
don't don't
I want you to just forget Jerry's dad

624
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,410
I want you to just forget Jerry's dad
 

625
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,400
I want you to just forget Jerry's dad
there you go get so you can see there's

626
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,410
there you go get so you can see there's
 

627
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,650
there you go get so you can see there's
forward there's forward into good then

628
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:02,660
forward there's forward into good then
 

629
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,530
forward there's forward into good then
you see and now when you go the private

630
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:08,540
you see and now when you go the private
 

631
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:17,820
you see and now when you go the private
life counter can't you see

632
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:17,830

 

633
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,100

go there again

634
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,110

 

635
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,930

you guys see that collapse which way is

636
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:28,940
you guys see that collapse which way is
 

637
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:38,440
you guys see that collapse which way is
it supposed to go is this your out yeah

638
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,450
it supposed to go is this your out yeah
 

639
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,620
it supposed to go is this your out yeah
cuz because do you feel the push and you

640
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:41,630
cuz because do you feel the push and you
 

641
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,470
cuz because do you feel the push and you
feel yourself stopping it okay so that

642
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
feel yourself stopping it okay so that
 

643
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,320
feel yourself stopping it okay so that
would be your money off and it'll work

644
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,330
would be your money off and it'll work
 

645
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,630
would be your money off and it'll work
if you're stronger than me if I don't

646
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:49,640
if you're stronger than me if I don't
 

647
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,730
if you're stronger than me if I don't
