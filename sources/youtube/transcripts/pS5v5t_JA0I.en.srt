before bed you sleep better when you

182
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,530
before bed you sleep better when you

open your chest out your breathing is

184
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,420
open your chest out your breathing is
 

185
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:48,510
open your chest out your breathing is
much better it doesn't take long

186
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,520

 

187
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:57,790

yeah you know that so the when you when

188
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:57,800
yeah you know that so the when you when
 

189
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,890
yeah you know that so the when you when
you pick up when I pick a pattern when I

190
00:05:59,890 --> 00:05:59,900
you pick up when I pick a pattern when I
 

191
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,190
you pick up when I pick a pattern when I
pick what we're gonna work on I'm gonna

192
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,200
pick what we're gonna work on I'm gonna
 

193
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,370
pick what we're gonna work on I'm gonna
start with mostly with what I suck at

194
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:08,380
start with mostly with what I suck at
 

195
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:16,500
start with mostly with what I suck at
and then I'm going to look at how can I

196
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,510
and then I'm going to look at how can I
 

197
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,110
and then I'm going to look at how can I
get you guys not to do this better but

198
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,120
get you guys not to do this better but
 

199
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,350
get you guys not to do this better but
stop sucking too so then the technique

200
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
stop sucking too so then the technique
 

201
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,620
stop sucking too so then the technique
might change an obvious one is we

202
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:26,630
might change an obvious one is we
 

203
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,270
might change an obvious one is we
started out with each other like

204
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,280
started out with each other like
 

205
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,060
started out with each other like
yesterday and then went to the cookie

206
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,070
yesterday and then went to the cookie
 

207
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,020
yesterday and then went to the cookie
nugget which which mechanical no

208
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,030
nugget which which mechanical no
 

209
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,090
nugget which which mechanical no
mechanically is exactly the same but

210
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,100
mechanically is exactly the same but
 

211
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,560
mechanically is exactly the same but
architectural II is totally different so

212
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,570
architectural II is totally different so
 

213
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,460
architectural II is totally different so
here I just I I believe that one of the

214
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,470
here I just I I believe that one of the
 

215
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,580
here I just I I believe that one of the
hardest things to do is measuring the

216
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:48,590
hardest things to do is measuring the
 

217
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,610
hardest things to do is measuring the
spatial harmony is very difficult to do

218
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:54,620
spatial harmony is very difficult to do
 

219
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,250
spatial harmony is very difficult to do
and I was noticing throughout the week

220
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,260
and I was noticing throughout the week
 

221
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,730
and I was noticing throughout the week
that every once in a while I was

222
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:00,740
that every once in a while I was
 

223
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,170
that every once in a while I was
getting too close or too far and it

224
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,180
getting too close or too far and it
 

225
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,900
getting too close or too far and it
became I started noticing as we moved on

226
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:07,910
became I started noticing as we moved on
 

227
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,999
became I started noticing as we moved on
to different weapons systems so as we

228
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,009
to different weapons systems so as we
 

229
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,409
to different weapons systems so as we
did the knife and we did the stick right

230
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:14,419
did the knife and we did the stick right
 

231
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,029
did the knife and we did the stick right
I watched it as us our group here you

232
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
I watched it as us our group here you
 

233
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,770
I watched it as us our group here you
can see you're too close to hit with

234
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:20,780
can see you're too close to hit with
 

235
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,790
can see you're too close to hit with
that stick you're hitting with the

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:21,800
that stick you're hitting with the
 

237
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,559
that stick you're hitting with the
middle of the stick not the end of the

00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:23,569
middle of the stick not the end of the
 

239
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,240
middle of the stick not the end of the
stick you're too far away you actually

240
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,250
stick you're too far away you actually
 

241
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,469
stick you're too far away you actually
miss you you did not step as far as you

242
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:29,479
miss you you did not step as far as you
 

243
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,450
miss you you did not step as far as you
needed to so that when you shift your

244
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,460
needed to so that when you shift your
 

245
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,010
needed to so that when you shift your
weight to the front leg you have a

246
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,020
weight to the front leg you have a
 

247
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,740
weight to the front leg you have a
displacement and a projection these are

248
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:35,750
displacement and a projection these are
 

249
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,999

all spatial problems so the sword one of

250
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:40,009
all spatial problems so the sword one of

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,070
all spatial problems so the sword one of
the best reasons for training with

252
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
the best reasons for training with
 

253
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,180
the best reasons for training with
weapons is that I have to sense the

254
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,190

 

255
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,600

proper spatial relationship in ways that

256
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,610
proper spatial relationship in ways that
 

257
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,200
proper spatial relationship in ways that
are way more subtle

258
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,210
are way more subtle
 

259
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:03,159
are way more subtle
but are also more it's more important so

260
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:03,169
but are also more it's more important so
 

261
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,029
but are also more it's more important so
meaning I can't really grab him forward

262
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
meaning I can't really grab him forward
 

263
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,670
meaning I can't really grab him forward
or backwards you get it because my sword

264
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
or backwards you get it because my sword
 

265
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,040
or backwards you get it because my sword
is not going to stick a hand out grabbed

266
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,050
is not going to stick a hand out grabbed
 

267
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,629
is not going to stick a hand out grabbed
his sword and put him in the right place

268
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:13,639
his sword and put him in the right place
 

269
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,480
his sword and put him in the right place
which is what we usually do right rather

270
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,490
which is what we usually do right rather
 

271
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,189
which is what we usually do right rather
than us moving in the right place we

272
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:18,199
than us moving in the right place we
 

273
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,260
than us moving in the right place we
push and pull them so that they are in

274
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,270
push and pull them so that they are in
 

275
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,600
push and pull them so that they are in
the right place and that's not martially

276
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,610
the right place and that's not martially
 

277
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,490
the right place and that's not martially
viable so the sword can't grab him and

278
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:27,500
viable so the sword can't grab him and
 

279
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,860
viable so the sword can't grab him and
and that makes it fun too early I'm too

280
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:29,870
and that makes it fun too early I'm too
 

281
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:37,680
and that makes it fun too early I'm too
late it's just glaringly obvious right

282
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:37,690

 

283
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,409

so this idea is very it's very

284
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:40,419
so this idea is very it's very
 

285
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,160
so this idea is very it's very
fascinating to me that there and very

286
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,170
fascinating to me that there and very
 

287
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:52,350
fascinating to me that there and very
very Japanese there is a perfect place

288
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,360
very Japanese there is a perfect place
 

289
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,280
very Japanese there is a perfect place
in the midst of their movement where I

290
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,290
in the midst of their movement where I

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,579
in the midst of their movement where I
can do basically nothing and have

00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:00,589
can do basically nothing and have
 

293
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:03,550
can do basically nothing and have
everything happen do you get that idea

294
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:03,560
everything happen do you get that idea
 

295
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,449
everything happen do you get that idea
and what is that not would that not be

296
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:07,459
and what is that not would that not be
 

297
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,060
and what is that not would that not be
one of the criteria of our

298
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,070
one of the criteria of our

it should be so in this case all right I

302
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,260
it should be so in this case all right I
 

303
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,030
it should be so in this case all right I
could swing his sword around right but

304
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,040
could swing his sword around right but
 

305
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,670
could swing his sword around right but
when you swing the sword around you're

306
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,680
when you swing the sword around you're
 

307
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
when you swing the sword around you're
not going to end up in the right place

308
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,090
not going to end up in the right place
 

309
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,700
not going to end up in the right place
for a technique like cutting edge you

310
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:29,710
for a technique like cutting edge you
 

311
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,250
for a technique like cutting edge you
see that so at this point I'm where I go

312
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,260
see that so at this point I'm where I go
 

313
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,200
see that so at this point I'm where I go
I want to I want to do spatial training

314
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,210
I want to I want to do spatial training
 

315
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,690
I want to I want to do spatial training
I want to find that that zero point

316
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:37,700
I want to find that that zero point
 

317
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,550
I want to find that that zero point
where nothing has to happen and

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,570
where nothing has to happen and
everything does occur but then you guys

320
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:43,580
everything does occur but then you guys
 

321
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,910
everything does occur but then you guys
are like right oh and you just swing in

322
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:48,920
are like right oh and you just swing in
 

323
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,190
are like right oh and you just swing in
this damn thing around not even trying

324
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
this damn thing around not even trying
 

325
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,730
this damn thing around not even trying
for it

326
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:51,740
for it
 

327
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,750
for it
so as you if you were if you're go back

328
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
so as you if you were if you're go back
 

329
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,980
so as you if you were if you're go back
and reflect when you tenkan you are not

330
00:09:59,980 --> 00:09:59,990
and reflect when you tenkan you are not
 

331
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,230
and reflect when you tenkan you are not
in the place of Titan Evancho the

332
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
in the place of Titan Evancho the
 

333
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,500
in the place of Titan Evancho the
body-to-body relationship so and all of

334
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,510
body-to-body relationship so and all of
 

335
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,200
body-to-body relationship so and all of
you just didn't care so now when I go

336
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,210
you just didn't care so now when I go
 

337
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,800
you just didn't care so now when I go
okay now you got a Duke odo - how are

338
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:11,810
okay now you got a Duke odo - how are
 

339
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,330
okay now you got a Duke odo - how are
you gonna do coding - when you're in

340
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:13,340
you gonna do coding - when you're in
 

341
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,230
you gonna do coding - when you're in
front right you get it so that's when

342
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,240
front right you get it so that's when
 

343
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,390
front right you get it so that's when
the instruction took on this other role

344
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,400
the instruction took on this other role
 

345
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,640
the instruction took on this other role
where and it doesn't read every time

346
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,650
where and it doesn't read every time
 

347
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,270
where and it doesn't read every time
right

348
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,280
right
 

349
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,950
right
okay now you - in order to get this to

350
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:26,960
okay now you - in order to get this to
 

351
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,890
okay now you - in order to get this to
work you got to be in this place and

352
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:29,900
work you got to be in this place and
 

353
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,990
work you got to be in this place and
then when you aim for that place Wow

354
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
then when you aim for that place Wow
 

355
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,030
then when you aim for that place Wow
well now I can get that first technique

356
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,040
well now I can get that first technique
 

357
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,120
well now I can get that first technique
toward that's that's what you're sensing

358
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,130
toward that's that's what you're sensing
 

359
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,880
toward that's that's what you're sensing
and then you're you can go back and go

360
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:39,890
and then you're you can go back and go
 

361
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,740
and then you're you can go back and go
wow that was really difficult at first

362
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:41,750
wow that was really difficult at first
 

363
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,680
wow that was really difficult at first
and then was not so difficult at first

the right place time you you need to

374
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:57,770
the right place time you you need to
 

375
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,970
the right place time you you need to
reassess don't don't start the next rep

376
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:00,980
reassess don't don't start the next rep
 

377
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,430
reassess don't don't start the next rep
and end up exactly when and where you

378
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
and end up exactly when and where you
 

379
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,890
and end up exactly when and where you
are that's just a wasted rep on a

380
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:08,900
are that's just a wasted rep on a
 

381
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,830
are that's just a wasted rep on a
similar vein I noticed that

382
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:10,840
similar vein I noticed that
 

383
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,900
similar vein I noticed that
after the weapons technique went back to

384
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:13,910
after the weapons technique went back to
 

385
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,810
after the weapons technique went back to
the test of a key on the if chem inside

386
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:16,820
the test of a key on the if chem inside
 

387
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,070
the test of a key on the if chem inside
I was much more responsive and my arm

388
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,080
I was much more responsive and my arm
 

389
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,890
I was much more responsive and my arm
would I was more connected to my arm

390
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:23,900
would I was more connected to my arm
 

391
