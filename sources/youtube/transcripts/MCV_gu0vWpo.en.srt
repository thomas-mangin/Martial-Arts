00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
OK! Hello everyone we are once
again in YouTube's studios,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,780
and I'm joined by Jordy Delage.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,380
We're going to discussed about a topic that he knows particularly well,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,680
and that is quite rarely covered in most aikido discussions.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,800
It's the philosophical and religious aspects of Ueshiba's approach.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,960
I'll let Jordy introduce himself,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,800
and explain why he's someone who can contribute to the debate,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,820
more so than a lot of us, and myself in particular.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,300
Thanks for the introduction,

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm not sure to what extent I can bring more to the debate than others,

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,460
but it's true that I studied

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,260
Japanese culture and language at university so I have an academic background,

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,200
regarding the history of japan,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,480
and that one of my specialties during those college years

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,180
is Japanese religion.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,740
Shinto, Buddhism,

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,680
and to some extent, Omoto-kyo - Ueshiba's religion -.

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,120
Through the light of an academic study of history and religion,

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,540
I wanted to understand how Ueshiba's mind worked

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:32,690
and what were the messages behind the esoteric speech

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,400
that were at the core of his teachings of Aikido.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,580
To do that one had to understand the historical and religious context,

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,380
as well as the outline of Omoto.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,740
I studied Omoto in some details,

25
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,480
but as an atheist, I didn't have much incentive to get into the details of its cosmogony.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,020
However, there are trends that emerge from Omoto,

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,640
which are very original and very specific
to this religion,

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,100
and which are very interesting, in my opinion, to shed light on the philosophy of Ueshiba.

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,560
Perhaps, in some way, some form of humanism, when placed in the context of time.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,920
The philosophy in Japanese schools at the beginning of the 20th century was not really permeated with humanism.

31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,180
That's it, I hope I can contribute to the debate a bit.

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,900
The question that comes right away is that people start Aikido for a number of reasons.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,580
Would you say that you started Aikido because you had an interest for this message,

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,880
not religious, but philosophical.

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,660
I didn't start Aikido because of any message it might have contained.

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,960
I started Aikido because I found myself by chance in an Aikido club.

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,120
A friend told me: "You should come and try, it's fun".

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,040
So I went and I took a few classes.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,840
It made me move a bit, I was 15 years old, I wasn't at peace with myself,

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,160
so during my teenage angst, Aikido was a good was to find some sense of balance.

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,500
I continued, but not because religious reasons

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,580
because it wasn't the style of my school or my club.

43
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,780
To put things into context, it was the school of Andre Cognard's, who was a student of Kobayashi Hirokazu in France.

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,700
Kobayashi Hirokazu was someone who developed Aikido with a certain ethical sense,

45
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:46,410
and with a large importance put on conflict resolution,

46
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,720
relationships between people, and so on.

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,040
It's interesting because you started Aikido a bit by chance,

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,640
then you must have leaned about the philosophical message,

49
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,320
and then it influenced you choice in terms of university courses.

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes, the way it unfolded it interesting

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,260
because I was lucky to find a teacher
who was someone quite simple.

52
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,500
I believe he was 3rd dan when I started with him,

53
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,200
but he was a very kind individual,

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,760
who didn't talk much, but who often said the right thing to make you think.

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,680
For me, it seemed consistent with the image I had of oriental religions,

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,000
in the way it encouraged people to reflect upon themselves, etc.

57
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,980
It was a bit silly to think that because he wasn't religious at all,

58
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,240
but I had this image, so I quickly became interested in the philosophy of aikido.

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,800
After a year or two, I started reading books,

60
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,160
some good ones, some bad ones, especially some bad ones, because there are a lot of bad books.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,160
Some of those books gave me a false image of Aikido,

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,080
- it's the case for a lot of people -

63
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,000
The majority of practitioners has the expunged image,

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
- in a way, the official image  -

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,060
of "The Invincible Warrior" by John Stevens,

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,860
who wrote a lot of very bad books about Aikido.

67
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,160
And then and when I decided to come to Japan.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,580
I had been practicing for a little over four years when I took the decision,

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,420
so it was before going to university, after
after getting my baccalaureate.

70
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,320
I thought I'd better study Japanese language rather than Japanese religion

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,160
so I mostly focused on that during the two or three months before going.

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,400
I went to Japan, I did Aikido at the Aikikai,
so I left my previous school,

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,700
and I didn't do much philosophy when I was at the Aikikai because the place isn't really suited to that.

74
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,960
I was really busy during my year in Japan,

75
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,720
I was learning Japanese, I was practicing a lot,

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:18,100
- when you practice a lot, you're often tired, so you don't have a lot of energy or willpower to do much else -

77
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,380
but after a year I realized that I had missed a few things.

78
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,000
I wasn't idle, I went to Tanabe,

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,380
I visited all the great temples

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,600
in Ueshiba's home region.

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Buddhist religion, in particular, has always interested me from a cultural point of view,

82
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,740
but nothing specific to the philosophy of Aikido or Ueshiba.

83
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,120
In the objective of being able to come back to Japan and to be able to spend more time,

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,980
and maybe this time, to catch up on what I had missed during my first year,

85
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,620
I decided to study Japanese at university.

86
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
That's where my decision came from.

87
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,900
When i saw that they had a religion class that was well put together,

88
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,400
I thought it would be a good opportunity
for me to acquire the keys

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,060
that I knew I would need for a more personal study, later on, in Japan.

90
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:36,700
I didn't want to risk to look into religion before having the methodological tools to do it

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,380
because I know how easy it is to fall in some certain tendencies...

92
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,460
Knowing myself, I didn't want to risk falling into that.

93
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160
Your grid of reading was an academic one.

94
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,180
Yes, I absolutely wanted this academic methodology.

95
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,700
I did not have it, I knew I needed it, so that;s what I went to get at university.

96
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,380
So I guess that you studied Shinto...

97
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:12,000
Shinto, Buddhism, and as my personal project, Omoto, on which I wrote a paper.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Talking about Omoto, was there anything about neo-religion in that curriculum?

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,620
The main course was mostly on the history of religions in Japan,

100
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,460
religious syncretism,

101
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,540
The relationship of the Japanese people towards religion through history,

102
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:37,540
which is especially interesting in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially the 20th century.
a little bit a few short on

103
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:46,080
Then a few classes on neo-religions obviously,

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,460
on New Age religions, in a way,

105
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,240
of which Omoto is one of the first.

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,340
Omoto is one of the first New age religions in Japan.

107
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,860
There were several attempts at about the same time but it's the first one that really took off.

108
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,760
They ended up with tens of thousands
of followers

109
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,960
at a time when

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,760
Japan was in search for religion.

111
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,940
The Meiji era s fascinating, it's my favorite period in Japan's history,

112
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,040
precisely because it was the time of the big change, the big upheavals, when people were lost,

113
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,300
when New Age religions appear precisely to fill in the lack of spirituality, that kind of things...

114
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:40,760
So precisely, Shinto was obviously very well implanted, the syncretism with the
Buddhism,

115
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,040
so there wasn't an absence of religion,

116
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,940
it was in everyday life, even though its importance is quite relative in Japan,

117
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,760
but could you explain what those neo-religions brought to the table,

118
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,570
especially Omoto,

119
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,200
compared to that Shinto base from which
they started?

120
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,640
There are two axes.

121
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
There is the axis that what I'm not going
not develop because I think that

122
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,160
everyone can understand that basically, the old religions do not provide answers to new problems.

123
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,680
You find this problem in all religions all over the world

124
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
Every time there are big revolutions, New Age religions appear

125
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,800
because they bring answers that other religions does not bring, from a spiritual point of view.

126
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,080
But questions that are totally concrete.

127
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,380
Absolutely, very often, on very concrete questions.

128
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,900
For example, the Japanese religions never really considered the opening towards foreigners.

129
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,320
On the other hand, Omoto worked on universalism,

130
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,840
which is something that was really quite new in Japanese logic.

131
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:55,780
Then there is a specificity of Japanese religions,

132
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,950
which is much more true for Shinto than for Buddhism,

133
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,320
but it'is also true for Buddhism,

134
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,780
it's that there is little interventionism in life of the average person.

135
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,540
[Japanese] religion defines a number of behaviors, like all religions,

136
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,620
but it doesn't give absolute keys on the
way of living one's life.

137
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,900
In my opinion, it's one of the major interests of the study of

138
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,640
the relationships between Buddhism and what we call today "bushido",

139
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,980
because bushido defines a number of
behaviors

140
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,080
that are consistent with some religious principles,

141
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:49,040
but it doesn't call upon superior or absolute ideals that would come from an Almighty God.

142
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:57,960
It's a system that built itself on totally practical aspects of the life of the warriors of that time.

143
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,860
Therefore,

144
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,440
Buddhism and Shintoism don't bring this absolute power,

145
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,240
and this absolute truth.

146
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,960
It's fascinating because even today in today's Japan,

147
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
we see the consequences of that.

148
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,480
I didn't come up with that, I read it in a book,

149
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,140
perhaps René Sieffert, or another expert of Japan, said:

150
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,640
"The Japanese are born Shinto, get married Christian"

151
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,240
- I was going to say Catholic, but precisely not Catholic, Christian -

152
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,100
"and die Buddhists."

153
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,960
That's incredibly true.

154
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,660
Ceremonies for children birth are Shinto ceremonies,

155
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,480
they get married by fake Christian priests,

156
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,180
on stages with cultural elements issued the
Christendom,

157
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,740
and when they die, those are Buddhist ceremonies.

158
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,960
What's fascinating is that

159
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,980
even today, researchers still wonder about that,

160
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
sociologists still wonder about that,

161
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,180
the Japanese themselves still wonder about that,

162
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,500
"Are Japanese people religious?"

163
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,020
The question comes up regularly, all the newspapers that talk about japan regularly do an article on this subject,

164
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,140
and is everyone always come to the same conclusion, saying:

165
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,260
"No, not really..."

166
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
When we talk about religion, we talk about faith.

167
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,880
Yes, we speak about faith. Are they religious in the Western sense of the term? In the sense of monotheist religions.

168
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,620
Precisely, because in the West, we distinguish "religious" or "devout" or "from a religious culture".

169
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,480
Yes.

170
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,100
They are very devout in the sense that when they build a house, they will have a Shinto ceremony,

171
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,520
so they are devoted, but there isn't necessarily any faith behind that.

172
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,060
It's more like folklore.

173
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,420
there is a quote by Musashi that I like and that goes:

174
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
"Revere the gods but don;t count on them."

175
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,400
It's extremely pragmatic, it's really a warrior's sentence.

176
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,480
It means that even if they don't exist, it won't hurt to do it...

177
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,660
It's Pascal's wager...

178
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,560
But if they exist, better not anger them.

179
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,780
I think that Japanese sociology

180
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,900
- with or without religion, -

181
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,340
is built upon a large number of pragmatic facts,

182
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,700
contrary to what happened in the West until the end of the 19th century.

183
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,320
Alright, there are a number of things that need explaining here...

184
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,360
How about we deal with it in the chronological order?

185
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,440
Ueshiba Morihei was raised in a Buddhist context.

186
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,040
Could you briefly go over this?

187
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,300
Yes, I think that we shave to start by that.

188
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,000
I was born at the end of the 19th century,

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
in the midst of the Meiji revolution.

190
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,220
The fighting is over.

191
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,900
The difficult transition period is over but,

192
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,240
it's a full blown Westernization period.

193
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,240
They take all of the Western technologies and they implement them in Japan.

194
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,500
He was born in that kind of Japan.

195
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,500
However, one should keep in mind that Tokyo is ultramodern for the time,

196
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,700
but Tanabe, not at all.

197
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,040
Tanabe hasn't seen the beginning of the industrial revolution before 1905-1910.

198
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,600
It came due to the war...

199
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,440
The Russo-Japanese war...

200
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,540
Yes, the Russo-Japanese war, and then the First World War,

201
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,220
which are periods that boost the economy,

202
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,020
and which allow technology to reach the countryside.

203
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:03,160
But before that, Japan has so much to catching up to do that their money is focused on building a modern Tokyo.

204
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,560
A little bit in the South too,

205
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,300
and also in Kyushu, due to the connections with foreigners that happened in the past.

206
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,420
But it was limited to a small number of entry points.

207
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,820
Tanabe, even today, is hard to reach,

208
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,060
so you have to imagine what it was a hundred years ago, it is in the middle of nowhere.

209
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:34,360
Around 6 or 7 years old, he starts learning Shingon Buddhism.

210
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:43,280
I need to point out that Tanabe, Wakayama, and that whole region is one of the two great religious centers  of Japan.

211
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,920
There is Izumo, in the South, which is even harder to get to,

212
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,080
and there is Wakayama, which has a lot of temples.

213
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,120
It's a beautiful region, which is even today relatively little urbanized.

214
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,140
Even more so at the time.

215
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,180
Japanese religion being linked, on the one hand, to one's ancestors, and on the other hand, to nature,

216
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,880
a region like Wakayama, with its mountains and its temples, its waterfall, etc.

217
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,460
- the famous waterfalls that we see on Ueshiba's photos, -

218
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,400
is quite conductive to spiritual and religious development.

219
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,940
He followed those teachings until he is about 20 years old, I think.

220
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,100
He did a bit of Zen too in the meantime.

221
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:36,720
He also received a title of transmission within the sect.

222
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,500
So we are talking about a very serious curriculum.

223
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,440
Very serious

224
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,740
Practically professional.

225
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,440
From that point, he could have decided to become a monk.

226
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Besides, it seems to me that in some writings about the youth of Ueshiba,

227
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,460
he is already described as a mystic at age 25.

228
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,220
When you start at 6 or 7 years old

229
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,460
and that you get a monks' scroll of 
complete transmission at 20,

230
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,500
the framework of Buddhism, and especially that of Shingon, which is

231
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,960
an esoteric and very complicated kind of Buddhism on top of that,

232
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,560
- it's much more complicated than Zen -

233
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,480
It will necessarily stay with him all his life.

234
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:37,940
That I think that his switch from Shinto to Omoto later on can be explained by that journey.

235
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,300
After that, he got other experiences.

236
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:48,820
By nature, Shinto doesn't have a teacher-disciple transmission like Buddhism.

237
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,520
It's much more tenuous.

238
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,700
Moreover, Shinto was very different from one region to the other, even at the time.

239
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,560
So the only truly structured religion was Buddhism

240
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,960
You spoke about syncretism between the two,

241
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,060
from the moment he had this curriculum in
Buddhism,

242
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,720
were there some aspects that were, mutually exclusive,

243
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,360
or was it all integrated then?

244
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:20,980
That's a difficult question that I couldn't answer with a lot of confidence,

245
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,960
because on the surface, Shinto and Buddhism are totally merged.

246
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,240
There are temples that are completely merged,

247
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,400
for the Buddhists, the Shinto gods are emanations of the Buddhas,

248
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,340
So it's really inextricable.

249
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,960
But based on what I read,

250
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
from a certain level of esoterism,

251
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,340
- notably in Shingon, and perhaps in others -

252
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,200
- there are many esoteric Buddhisms -

253
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,280
they must get to a point where the
their theorizing, their theology,

254
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,700
allows to extract Buddhism from Shinto,

255
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not sure I could answer without being religious myself.

256
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,060
So when we talk about Ueshiba studying Buddhism and Shinto, we can consider that it was Shinto/Buddhism,

257
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,720
that there was no transition from one to the other.

258
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,100
No, there was no transition at all, it's one and same thing.

259
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,900
Then when he traveled away from Wakayama,

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,980
he went to Tokyo, etc.

261
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,440
he may have lost some ties with his Buddhist upbringing,

262
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,220
- he already chose not to pursue this vocation -

263
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,900
He went up to the city and came to Tokyo.

264
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,860
To put it in the context I was explaining earlier,

265
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,820
it's equivalent to someone today who comes from the middle of nowhere and moves to the capital.

266
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,280
That's it but to the power of 1000.

267
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,360
I think that the first time he went to Tokyo, he wanted to settle as...

268
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,820
A stationery.

269
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,500
Yes, a stationary, but it didn't go very well...

270
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,520
It didn't go very well but we must keep in mind how hard it must have been for someone form the countryside.

271
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,100
It must also have been extremely competitive.

272
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,140
To put it in context once again,

273
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,220
All the samurai who were employed 30 years before,

274
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,000
- 7% of the population -

275
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,580
found themselves unemployed.

276
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:29,880
They placed a few of them within...

277
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
Administration.

278
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,060
Yes, they placed some of them into administration.

279
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,220
but they didn't want put too much because of the small revolts that occurred before,

280
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,340
and the goal was to change the whole system, so they thought that if they placed samurai everywhere,

281
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,020
they would end up with families that were more powerful than others, etc

282
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:54,360
They had to cross that out and suppress the system of casts.

283
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,400
So for it to work form a social point of view, 
the redneck had to be able to become the new samurai.

284
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
Otherwise, it wouldn't work.

285
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,420
They didn't leave the door wide open, like what they did after WWII,

286
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,740
but they did slightly open the doors.

287
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,580
That said, the mother of Ueshiba came from a samurai family,

288
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,880
she was issued from Aizu, the Takeda family.

289
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:32,460
I'm not sure because it sees that Ueshiba had to borrow a kamon from someone to be accepted by Takeda.

290
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,740
So to what extend was Ueshiba really from a samurai family,

291
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,160
or which type of samurai family,

292
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,680
because hierarchy goes from very low to very high.

293
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,360
I don't even know whether the lower classes samurai had a kamon or not.

294
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,600
It's likely that they had

295
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,140
but once again, even by the end of the Edo era

296
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,720
the system is already a little bit in the process of disintegration,

297
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,820
there hasn't been any fighting for more than 200 years...

298
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,520
If they has really been from Aizu,

299
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,080
after the defeat they suffered, it's obvious that their status would have been undermined.

300
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,240
Yes, but that would have gotten erased by the Meiji revolution.

301
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,480
He could have said: "I'll take back my title, and let;s not talk about the details"

302
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
I think it would have worked.

303
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,840
The problem is to understand that even if it had been the case,

304
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,720
the small samurai families were relatively poor,

305
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,960
and had much lower living standard than the merchants, who were far richer,

306
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
even compared to some farmers, who had managed to become rich then.

307
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Precisely, Ueshiba's father was a land owner.

308
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,500
Very well considered, at least on paper.

309
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,560
So those who were landowners and rich
were well considered,

310
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,420
those who were landowners and poor were not.

311
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,960
Merchants, who should have been under the farmers in the caste system

312
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,700
used their money to be well considered.

313
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,860
When the whole system got dismantled,

314
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,480
though having samurai origins could always be useful,

315
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,740
it didn't have true reasons to be.

316
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,460
So it's logical that Ueshiba went to town to start a stationary.

317
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,820
It's exactly what the government of the time wanted for its society.

318
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:44,520
They wanted entrepreneurs to compete in the Western logic.

319
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,680
It didn't not work for Ueshiba, though we can suspect that his father helped him a lot,

320
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
because his father had some money.

321
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,840
At that time, he had already mingled in martial arts,

322
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,520
he went to Tokyo and discovered many things,

323
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,200
- it should really contextualized like this -

324
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,320
Ueshiba, son of a small land owner from the countryside,

325
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,680
moves to Tokyo,

326
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,740
starts his business, fails,

327
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,580
he had already done some martial arts at that time,

328
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,880
there is a rise - not yet of nationalism at the time -

329
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,100
but of a desire from Japan to have...

330
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,260
What year are we there, to give a time frame?

331
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,840
It's the beginning of the 20th century,

332
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,540
Ueshiba was born in 1883,

333
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,680
1903?

334
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,280
Just before the Russo-Japanese war.

335
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,520
Just before the Russo-Japanese, precisely.

336
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,640
At that time, Japan wants to became the equal of the Western powers,

337
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,840
but Russia gets in the way,

338
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:02,180
it's an excellent opportunity to explain
to the West than the 20 to 30 years of modernization that Japan undertook,

339
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:09,880
brought them to a level were they can compete with Western powers.

340
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,000
And against all odds, it worked.

341
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And against all odds, it worked,

342
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,960
and what's truly remarkable is,

343
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,600
- I jump a bit in time, because we'll cover that later -

344
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,180
it's the fact that Deguchi Nao predicted...

345
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,380
Yes, she predicted it!

346
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,840
the Russo-Japanese war before it broke out,

347
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
she predicted the victory of Japan,

348
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
that's what gave a lot of credibility...

349
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
It gave her a lot of credibility...

350
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,660
And she lost it afterwards when she got mistaken...

351
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,240
Yes, just after, she gets it wrong...

352
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
On the colonization...

353
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Yes, she predicts the failure of the Japanese invasion in China,

354
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,640
but it turned out to be a success.

355
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,200
She lost some credibility.

356
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Later, she predicted WWII

357
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,400
she predicts the war with the US and the absolute defeat of Japan,

358
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,940
so she was right once again.

359
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
That said,

360
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,040
the world at the time was filled with people who made predictions

361
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,540
and there are necessarily some of them who can be right sometimes.

362
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,800
Who guess right, of course,

363
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,580
we never mention all those who were wrong.

364
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,040
Exactly, it since she hasn't always been right, one can question things.

365
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,560
That's the context.

366
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:32,260
The young Ueshiba enrolls in the army because it;s a good opportunity.

367
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:39,980
He failed his entry into commercial, consumerist, Western life in Tokyo,

368
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,960
so another way to be useful to his country would be...

369
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,580
We're dealing with someone who's in search of himself.

370
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,080
Yes.

371
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,620
He's trying to find his place in society,

372
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,940
and the war was a legitimate cause.

373
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,020
Just like 90% of the Japanese of the time.

374
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,420
That;s why the historical contextualization is really very important.

375
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,540
The complete upheaval that there has been in the Japanese society,

376
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,800
the destruction of the caste system,

377
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,960
the race for technological and economical development in order to catch up with the West,

378
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,440
out of a fear of being colonized.

379
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,799
- it was the specialty of the West -

380
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,760
Especially since they had threatened to do it several times.

381
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,220
They had threatened Japan,

382
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,800
they had made them sign a number of less than advantageous treaties,

383
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,240
and strengthened by the victory against Russia,

384
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,020
Japan could renegotiate a number of treaties.

385
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,740
In a more egalitarian relationship,

386
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,020
that no other nation in Asia could enjoy.

387
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Absolutely.

388
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,500
It interesting to look at it this way.

389
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,000
It's also perhaps what gave birth to the first nationalistic sentiments:

390
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,360
"Japan does everything right..."

391
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Clearly, especially since that when the had to find out the reasons behind their success against the Russians,

392
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,780
they though: "What could it be?"

393
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,500
"It must be bushido!"

394
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Yes.

395
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,520
It's funny since it's just after - 
some 20 years after -

396
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:16,080
the fact that the government totally disowned any culture linked to bushido.

397
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,460
During the Meiji revolution they even got to the point of not

398
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,040
re-hiring the samurai in the army of conscripts

399
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,660
because they wanted to completely cut off everything that had to do with this warrior past.

400
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,960
It's also quite ironic to see that today we
consider

401
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,360
- a lot of people consider -

402
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,560
martial arts [budo] as arts for combat,

403
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,260
even though there hadn't been any war for 250 years

404
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,540
and that when it became necessary to build a strong army...

405
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,740
They didn't call upon those guys!

406
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
They didn't take those guys.

407
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,640
We can always go back further in time, obviously these are martial arts,

408
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,080
but it seems to me pretty difficult to justify the teaching

409
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,360
of a really combative fighting spirit in the martial arts in this context,

410
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,240
and I think that it must also have been difficult to justify form Ueshiba's point of view.

411
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,140
He's in that context,

412
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,640
- and something else that is quite remarkable -

413
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,480
He starts learning juken, the bayonet,

414
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,060
he's apparently becoming a good fighter on the battlefield.

415
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,380
The discussion that we had with Bennett not long ago

416
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,200
- I don't know whether it'll be published before or after this interview -

417
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,260
shows us that Ueshiba was perhaps not a great master of bayonet...

418
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,400
At least not the Japanese techniques...

419
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,800
Right, technically speaking.

420
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,160
But we know that in spite of that, he was pretty efficient on the battlefield.

421
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,340
But again, a Western one.

422
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,780
It's a Western art.

423
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,680
He fought with a riffle, not with a sword

424
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:14,560
so we never heard of Ueshiba's skills with a sword on a battlefield.

425
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,980
He did carried a sword though, but no.

426
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,640
It's quite interesting to...

427
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,720
to thin about this context of how much Japan wanted to be more Western than the Westerners.

428
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,880
Just like foreigners who come to Japan today want to be more Japanese than the Japanese...

429
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,100
At the time, Japanese wanted to be more Western than the Westerners,

430
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,240
and they were pretty successful.

431
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,320
It might be this tendency to push to much in that direction

432
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,980
that created an inverse sentiment, a return to nationalism, to the roots, etc.

433
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,800
I think it influenced a lot Ueshiba's thinking a few years later.
