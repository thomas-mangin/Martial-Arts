here so if I want to lift my arm
 

175
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,980
here so if I want to lift my arm
it will be lifted on that spiral or this

176
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:23,990

 

177
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,310

because this is week this is week even

178
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
because this is week this is week even
 

179
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
because this is week this is week even
if I get physically strong eventually I

180
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:30,810
if I get physically strong eventually I
 

181
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,579
if I get physically strong eventually I
get old and I can't do it so you have a

182
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:34,589
get old and I can't do it so you have a
 

183
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,380
get old and I can't do it so you have a
lot of strong people when they start

184
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,390
lot of strong people when they start
 

185
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,160
lot of strong people when they start
hitting their 50s 60s 70s and it not so

186
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,170
hitting their 50s 60s 70s and it not so
 

187
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,180
hitting their 50s 60s 70s and it not so
strong anymore because these muscles get

188
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,190
strong anymore because these muscles get
 

189
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,490
strong anymore because these muscles get
weaker with age and with injury which

190
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:46,500
weaker with age and with injury which
 

191
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,210
weaker with age and with injury which
that's prone to injury so I move my hand

192
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,220
that's prone to injury so I move my hand
 

193
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,269
that's prone to injury so I move my hand
always that's what I want to do is in

194
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
always that's what I want to do is in
 

195
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,519
always that's what I want to do is in
these spiders ok well that could also be

196
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:58,529
these spiders ok well that could also be
 

197
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:05,630
these spiders ok well that could also be
looked at as at a kind of level of

198
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:05,640
looked at as at a kind of level of
 

199
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,850
looked at as at a kind of level of
analogy so for example I go this is a

200
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860
analogy so for example I go this is a
 

201
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,000
analogy so for example I go this is a
manifestation of my of my proper body

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,010
manifestation of my of my proper body
 

203
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,870
manifestation of my of my proper body
movement well what is that body movement

204
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:17,880
movement well what is that body movement
 

205
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,560
movement well what is that body movement
doing well I don't want to lift in a

206
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,570
doing well I don't want to lift in a
 

207
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,190
doing well I don't want to lift in a
straight way I don't want to use small

208
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
straight way I don't want to use small
 

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,740
straight way I don't want to use small
muscle groups I don't want to employ a

210
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:29,750
muscle groups I don't want to employ a
 

211
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:36,290
muscle groups I don't want to employ a
system that is very time sensitive now

212
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:36,300
system that is very time sensitive now
 

213
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,150
system that is very time sensitive now
you have all the more of a life

214
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
you have all the more of a life
 

215
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,139
you have all the more of a life
philosophy you could do that ok so for

216
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:42,149
philosophy you could do that ok so for
 

217
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:50,030
philosophy you could do that ok so for
example let's take this little drill and

218
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
example let's take this little drill and
 

219
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,610
example let's take this little drill and
let's look at it strategically ok if I

220
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:55,620
let's look at it strategically ok if I
 

221
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,550
let's look at it strategically ok if I
go around the first

222
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
go around the first
 

223
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,759
go around the first
and they are side by side with me get it

224
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:03,769
and they are side by side with me get it
 

225
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:09,970
and they are side by side with me get it
however I really established dominance

226
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:09,980
however I really established dominance
 

227
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,920
however I really established dominance
tactically no we're just we're 50/50

228
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:12,930
tactically no we're just we're 50/50
 

229
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,760
tactically no we're just we're 50/50
again you're on that side on this side

230
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:19,770

 

231
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,750

so if they have a weapon and I have a

232
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
so if they have a weapon and I have a
 

233
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,730
so if they have a weapon and I have a
weapon that's not a good place to be to

234
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:28,740
weapon that's not a good place to be to
 

235
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,460
weapon that's not a good place to be to
put someone behind my back in equal

236
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,470
put someone behind my back in equal
 

237
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,200
put someone behind my back in equal
amount so but if they're just going to

238
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,210
amount so but if they're just going to
 

239
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,610
amount so but if they're just going to
hold on to my wrist then it would work

240
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:39,620
hold on to my wrist then it would work
 

241
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,890
hold on to my wrist then it would work
you see that so it's working under a

242
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:42,900
you see that so it's working under a
 

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,690
you see that so it's working under a
very small situation not now we're not

244
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:47,700
very small situation not now we're not
 

245
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,140
very small situation not now we're not
following that other let's not have such

246
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,150
following that other let's not have such
 

247
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,360
following that other let's not have such
limiting applications let's see if we

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,370
limiting applications let's see if we
 

249
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,180
limiting applications let's see if we
can have a universal application so for

250
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,190
can have a universal application so for
 

251
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,490
can have a universal application so for
so then you can stick a weapon in the

252
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:58,500
so then you can stick a weapon in the
 

253
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,650
so then you can stick a weapon in the
other guy's hand and it will not change

254
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:00,660
other guy's hand and it will not change
 

255
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,440
other guy's hand and it will not change
this dynamics we could take the weapon

256
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,450
this dynamics we could take the weapon
 

257
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,450
this dynamics we could take the weapon
out of that person stand it will not

258
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,460
out of that person stand it will not
 

259
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,490
out of that person stand it will not
change the dynamics you can have another

260
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,500
change the dynamics you can have another
 

261
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,730
change the dynamics you can have another
person coming in it will not change the

262
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:10,740
person coming in it will not change the
 

263
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,780
person coming in it will not change the
dynamics yes one application is able to

264
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:14,790
dynamics yes one application is able to
 

265
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,140
dynamics yes one application is able to
answer many many more situations so that

266
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,150
answer many many more situations so that
 

267
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,840
answer many many more situations so that
is nothing more than another Russian

268
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:20,850
is nothing more than another Russian
 

269
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,340
is nothing more than another Russian
doll of the same physiological and that

270
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,350
doll of the same physiological and that
 

271
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,040
doll of the same physiological and that
is what you're supposed to do so I

272
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,050
is what you're supposed to do so I
 

273
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,200
is what you're supposed to do so I
mentioned we Sachi and we actually

274
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,210
mentioned we Sachi and we actually
 

275
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,900
mentioned we Sachi and we actually
talked about the sword is cannot be

276
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:35,910
talked about the sword is cannot be
 

277
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,700
talked about the sword is cannot be
thought of as a trivial thing because

278
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:37,710
thought of as a trivial thing because
 

279
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,210
thought of as a trivial thing because
always are in the sword he can say that

280
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,220
always are in the sword he can say that
 

281
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,520
always are in the sword he can say that
because he's employing this east-asian

282
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,530
because he's employing this east-asian
 

283
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,590
because he's employing this east-asian
way of thinking he is using that sword

284
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,600
way of thinking he is using that sword
 

285
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,780
way of thinking he is using that sword
as a Russian doll for these other truths

286
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:50,790
as a Russian doll for these other truths
 

287
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,830
as a Russian doll for these other truths
so then he can inversely say this is all

288
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:54,840
so then he can inversely say this is all
 

289
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,170
so then he can inversely say this is all
those other dolls you hear this today

290
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,180
those other dolls you hear this today
 

291
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,170
those other dolls you hear this today
where a lot of people

292
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,180
where a lot of people

everything's jiu-jitsu right it's
 

295
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,970
everything's jiu-jitsu right it's
because they're able to see and apply

296
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:03,980
because they're able to see and apply
 

297
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,220
because they're able to see and apply
right what is the principle of

298
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,230
right what is the principle of
 

299
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,830
right what is the principle of
non-resistance it's in the art right

300
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:08,840
non-resistance it's in the art right
 

301
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,290
non-resistance it's in the art right
what is the principle of leverage it's

302
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:11,300
what is the principle of leverage it's
 

303
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,940
what is the principle of leverage it's
in the art what is the principle of

in the art what is the principle of
communion and then removing sin the more

communion and then removing sin the more
so you can start using those as and

308
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,450
so you can start using those as and
 

309
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,230
so you can start using those as and
you're supposed to as life philosophies

310
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,240
you're supposed to as life philosophies
 

311
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,160
you're supposed to as life philosophies
okay but do not get confused with the

312
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,170
okay but do not get confused with the
 

313
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,240
okay but do not get confused with the
modern way of this here's my caveat they

314
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,250
modern way of this here's my caveat they
 

315
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,300
modern way of this here's my caveat they
can be used as life philosophies but the

316
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,310
can be used as life philosophies but the
 

317
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,360
can be used as life philosophies but the
ultimate aim of Budo is not a life

318
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,370
ultimate aim of Budo is not a life
 

319
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,740
ultimate aim of Budo is not a life
philosophy it is a way of being so if

320
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:41,750
philosophy it is a way of being so if
 

321
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,290
philosophy it is a way of being so if
what I'm trying to do remains is the

322
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,300
what I'm trying to do remains is the
 

323
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,210
what I'm trying to do remains is the
philosophy and it's not innately in me

324
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,220
philosophy and it's not innately in me
 

325
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,460
philosophy and it's not innately in me
then I'm not doing my Buddha which means

326
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,470
then I'm not doing my Buddha which means
 

327
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,100
then I'm not doing my Buddha which means
that when my boss comes and gets on me

328
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,110
that when my boss comes and gets on me
 

329
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,570
that when my boss comes and gets on me
and it takes two days for me to

330
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:57,580
and it takes two days for me to
 

331
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,120
and it takes two days for me to

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
it then this is just an intellectual
 

335
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,750
it then this is just an intellectual
exercise

336
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
exercise
 

337
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,810

it's got to be medium as immediate as
 

339
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,020
it's got to be medium as immediate as
you grab me go you come in you're the

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,030
you grab me go you come in you're the
 

341
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,760
you grab me go you come in you're the
boss you're yelling at me it's

342
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:12,770
boss you're yelling at me it's
 

343
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,380
boss you're yelling at me it's
triggering me boom I feel it attempt on

344
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,390
triggering me boom I feel it attempt on
 

345
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,570
triggering me boom I feel it attempt on
right I'm not there anymore we're not in

346
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:19,580
right I'm not there anymore we're not in
 

347
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,320
right I'm not there anymore we're not in
contention

348
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,330
contention
 

349
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,829

I'm not suffering inside and we get all

350
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
I'm not suffering inside and we get all
 

351
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,740
I'm not suffering inside and we get all
this why

352
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:25,750
this why
 

353
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,289
this why
same thing goes not just my boss it's

354
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:29,299
same thing goes not just my boss it's
 

355
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,539
same thing goes not just my boss it's
gonna be the same thing with my parents

356
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:31,549
gonna be the same thing with my parents
 

357
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,940
gonna be the same thing with my parents
or my spouse's do you get it because we

358
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:33,950
or my spouse's do you get it because we
 

359
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,060
or my spouse's do you get it because we
might want to go no when I'm at home I'm

360
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,070
might want to go no when I'm at home I'm
 

361
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,369
might want to go no when I'm at home I'm
not going to do the art I'm gonna be a

362
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:39,379
not going to do the art I'm gonna be a
 

363
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:44,409
not going to do the art I'm gonna be a
little dog Emperor to get it and your

364
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:44,419
little dog Emperor to get it and your
 

365
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,249
little dog Emperor to get it and your
art is now just intellectual which is

366
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:48,259
art is now just intellectual which is
 

367
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:50,889
art is now just intellectual which is
why we practice it if we just wanted a

368
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:50,899
why we practice it if we just wanted a
 

369
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,779
why we practice it if we just wanted a
philosophy we could just have a

370
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:52,789
philosophy we could just have a
 

371
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:56,980
philosophy we could just have a
university class any other technical

372
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:56,990
university class any other technical
 

373
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,430
university class any other technical
questions on the technique

374
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,440

 

375
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:13,350

not even on no comments

376
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360

 

377
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:22,490

[Music]

378
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500

 

379
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500

so let's think about two ways of doing

380
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,510
so let's think about two ways of doing
 

381
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:32,250
so let's think about two ways of doing
this ten yeah I enter the person is

382
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,260
this ten yeah I enter the person is
 

383
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,970
this ten yeah I enter the person is
basically still upright and then not

384
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:35,980
basically still upright and then not
 

385
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,090
basically still upright and then not
used to have to now bring them into a

386
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,100
used to have to now bring them into a
 

387
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,400
used to have to now bring them into a
descending or I enter in such a way that

388
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,410
descending or I enter in such a way that
 

389
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,910
descending or I enter in such a way that
they're already followed and I'm now

390
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:47,920
they're already followed and I'm now
 

391
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,980
they're already followed and I'm now
lowering the hand on a descending body

392
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:51,990
lowering the hand on a descending body
 

393
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,830
lowering the hand on a descending body
which one takes less energy the second

394
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
which one takes less energy the second
 

395
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,190
which one takes less energy the second
one

396
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,200
one
 

397
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,290
one
so therefore which one will have a

398
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,300
so therefore which one will have a
 

399
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,170
so therefore which one will have a
higher mechanical ceiling meaning which

400
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,180
higher mechanical ceiling meaning which
 

401
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,970
higher mechanical ceiling meaning which
one will I be able to do on a bigger

402
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:02,980
one will I be able to do on a bigger
 

403
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,650
one will I be able to do on a bigger
person the second one so if you guess

404
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:07,660
person the second one so if you guess
 

405
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,510
person the second one so if you guess
this is why I was trying to have you

406
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
this is why I was trying to have you
 

407
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,200
this is why I was trying to have you
make it one and I was telling you you're

408
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,210
make it one and I was telling you you're
 

409
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,420
make it one and I was telling you you're
ensuring is what's taking their balance

410
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,430
ensuring is what's taking their balance
 

411
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,000
ensuring is what's taking their balance
they're already following it is much

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,010
they're already following it is much
 

413
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,060
they're already following it is much
more energy efficient to aim falling

414
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,070
more energy efficient to aim falling
 

415
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,650
more energy efficient to aim falling
people than to throw people down okay

416
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:28,660
people than to throw people down okay
 

417
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,990
people than to throw people down okay
throwing people down takes a lot of

418
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,000
throwing people down takes a lot of
 

419
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,910
throwing people down takes a lot of
energy if you're aiming falling people

420
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:35,920
energy if you're aiming falling people
 

421
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,690
energy if you're aiming falling people
you can actually leave them in the

422
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:39,700
you can actually leave them in the
 

423
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,460
you can actually leave them in the
descent and get to your weapon

424
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,470
descent and get to your weapon
 

425
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,229
descent and get to your weapon
but if they're still standing and are

426
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:47,239
but if they're still standing and are
 

427
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,799
but if they're still standing and are
waiting for you to do that

428
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:49,809
waiting for you to do that
 

429
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,149
waiting for you to do that
you are as occupied as they are so maybe

430
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:55,159
you are as occupied as they are so maybe
 

431
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,239
you are as occupied as they are so maybe
not physically you're not being pinned

432
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:58,249
not physically you're not being pinned
 

433
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,289
not physically you're not being pinned
but you are strategically tactically and

434
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:02,299
but you are strategically tactically and
 

435
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,169
but you are strategically tactically and
therefore ideational ease as much

436
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:05,179
therefore ideational ease as much
 

437
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,090
therefore ideational ease as much
trapped in that as they are okay when

438
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,100
trapped in that as they are okay when
 

439
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,999
trapped in that as they are okay when
your body enters to displace they're

440
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:13,009
your body enters to displace they're
 

441
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,669
your body enters to displace they're
already falling you can opt to leave

442
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
already falling you can opt to leave
 

443
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,580
already falling you can opt to leave
them there just let go and you can go to

444
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,590
them there just let go and you can go to
 

445
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:34,260
them there just let go and you can go to
your weapon you can get

446
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,270

 

447
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,940

yeah you only get to that part and then

448
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:36,950
yeah you only get to that part and then
 

449
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:48,300
yeah you only get to that part and then
the arms underneath and then therefore

450
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,310

 

451
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,160

yeah a little bit so usually what

452
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,170
yeah a little bit so usually what
 

453
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,070
yeah a little bit so usually what
happens is I think we had like different

454
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
happens is I think we had like different
 

455
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,300
happens is I think we had like different
training cultures because we do the one

456
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,310
training cultures because we do the one
 

457
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,180
training cultures because we do the one
where in other cultures you're expected

458
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,190
where in other cultures you're expected
 

459
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,520
where in other cultures you're expected
to go to the side and you do kind of go

460
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,530
to go to the side and you do kind of go
 

461
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,790
to go to the side and you do kind of go
more around you use the distal and

462
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:05,800
more around you use the distal and
 

463
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,380
more around you use the distal and
lovely theory do you know what I mean so

464
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,390
lovely theory do you know what I mean so
 

465
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,100
lovely theory do you know what I mean so
when you do this you you

466
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,110
when you do this you you
 

467
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,580
when you do this you you
mechanical engine that I will work on

468
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:17,590
mechanical engine that I will work on
 

469
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,520
mechanical engine that I will work on
that perimeter forearm to get this to me

470
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,530
that perimeter forearm to get this to me
 

471
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,100
that perimeter forearm to get this to me
but we're doing something different you

472
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,110
but we're doing something different you
 

473
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,049
but we're doing something different you
see how we're going like this and so

474
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:28,059
see how we're going like this and so
 

475
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:33,330
see how we're going like this and so
that each cable do something else it's

476
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:33,340
that each cable do something else it's
 

477
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,280
that each cable do something else it's
just why I kept saying keep your breath

478
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,290
just why I kept saying keep your breath
 

479
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,730
just why I kept saying keep your breath
keep it right because when you when you

480
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:38,740
keep it right because when you when you
 

481
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,549
keep it right because when you when you
take your when you allow that little bit

482
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:41,559
take your when you allow that little bit
 

483
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,240
take your when you allow that little bit
of movement ok has a lot more leeway and

484
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,250
of movement ok has a lot more leeway and
 

485
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,570
of movement ok has a lot more leeway and
what they can do or not do so ok keeps

486
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:51,580
what they can do or not do so ok keeps
 

487
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,870
what they can do or not do so ok keeps
their grip

488
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:57,880

 

489
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,100

they get where they need to be but what

490
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,110
they get where they need to be but what
 

491
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,310
they get where they need to be but what
still happens especially when you are

492
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,320
still happens especially when you are
 

493
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,730
still happens especially when you are
not using your individual muscle groups

494
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:08,740
not using your individual muscle groups
