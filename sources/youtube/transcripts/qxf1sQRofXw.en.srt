wears red caps and he's in his 70s isn't
he

202
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
he
 

203
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,290
he
is it because he feels younger vibrant

204
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
is it because he feels younger vibrant
 

205
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,270
is it because he feels younger vibrant
lots of energy

lots of energy
I've no idea and I'm no idea what you

208
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:16,979
I've no idea and I'm no idea what you
 

209
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,070
I've no idea and I'm no idea what you
might think of him and that's not

210
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
might think of him and that's not
 

211
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,210
might think of him and that's not
important in this case

212
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,220

 

213
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,330

it takes me back to thinking about my

214
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:26,340
it takes me back to thinking about my
 

215
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,310
it takes me back to thinking about my
mother when she was 80 and I was 50.

216
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,320

 

217
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,249

mum I said what do you think

218
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:34,259
mum I said what do you think
 

219
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,749
mum I said what do you think
the difference is between 50 and 80.

220
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759

 

221
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,810

I'll put this on because she said

222
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820
I'll put this on because she said
 

223
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,790
I'll put this on because she said
in my head I still think I'm 20.

224
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:49,800
in my head I still think I'm 20.
 

225
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,430
in my head I still think I'm 20.
but I get a lot more tired nowadays

226
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440

 

227
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,290

so

228
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
so
 

229
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,749
so
does this cap

230
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
does this cap
 

231
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,730
does this cap
suit me

232
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
suit me
 

233
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,390
suit me
now the age I am

234
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400

 

235
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,810

so this brings me on to this story of

236
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:11,820
so this brings me on to this story of
 

237
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,450
so this brings me on to this story of
student and teacher

238
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,460
student and teacher
 

239
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,650
student and teacher
and and the Aikido that we do

240
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:18,660
and and the Aikido that we do
 

241
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,710
and and the Aikido that we do
as a teacher

242
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
as a teacher
 

243
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,290
as a teacher
as a student

244
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,300
as a student
 

245
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,249
as a student
so I'm changing caps

246
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:28,259
so I'm changing caps
 

247
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,920
so I'm changing caps
but I sit here or with my age unchanged

248
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:31,930
but I sit here or with my age unchanged
 

249
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,909
but I sit here or with my age unchanged

[Music]
 

251
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,770
[Music]
so it doesn't matter what age you are

252
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:36,780
so it doesn't matter what age you are
 

253
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,830
so it doesn't matter what age you are
when you're training on the mat

254
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
when you're training on the mat
 

255
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,350
when you're training on the mat
but as the student

256
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360

 

257
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,110

this cat is worn

258
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
this cat is worn
 

259
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,330
this cat is worn
or it has been by me

260
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,340
or it has been by me
 

261
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,150
or it has been by me
whether it makes sense to you this film

262
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,160
whether it makes sense to you this film
 

263
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,110
whether it makes sense to you this film
or be down to the individual

264
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
or be down to the individual
 

265
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,210
or be down to the individual
and whether you say it through to the

266
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,220
and whether you say it through to the
 

267
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,430
and whether you say it through to the
end

268
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440

 

269
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,010

now this curve

270
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,020
now this curve
 

271
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,570
now this curve
I feel great I feel young

272
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:07,580
I feel great I feel young
 

273
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,730
I feel great I feel young
makes me so that people might think I'm

274
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,740
makes me so that people might think I'm
 

275
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,189
makes me so that people might think I'm
old looking at me but I'm not old my

276
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
old looking at me but I'm not old my
 

277
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,590
old looking at me but I'm not old my
head's still thinking that perhaps I'm

278
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
head's still thinking that perhaps I'm
 

279
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,290
head's still thinking that perhaps I'm
not 20 but you know it's still thinking

280
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,300
not 20 but you know it's still thinking
 

281
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,370
not 20 but you know it's still thinking
of when I was younger

282
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,380

 

283
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,170

so when I try to train on the mat

284
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,180

 

285
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,409

why do I make so many mistakes why do I

286
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:30,419
why do I make so many mistakes why do I
 

287
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,469
why do I make so many mistakes why do I
keep thinking you know as much as I

288
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
keep thinking you know as much as I
 

289
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,230
keep thinking you know as much as I
might be enjoying it

290
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
might be enjoying it
 

291
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,710
might be enjoying it
I'm still working on a lot of things and

292
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm still working on a lot of things and
 

293
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,490
I'm still working on a lot of things and
knowing that I'm getting it wrong a lot

294
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,500
knowing that I'm getting it wrong a lot
 

295
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,089
knowing that I'm getting it wrong a lot
I might even be having a lot of fun and

296
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:47,099
I might even be having a lot of fun and
 

297
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,370
I might even be having a lot of fun and
I may be even better than the person I'm

298
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
I may be even better than the person I'm
 

299
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,450
I may be even better than the person I'm
training with

300
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:53,460

 

301
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,450

but I still go home thinking you know I

302
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:56,460
but I still go home thinking you know I
 

303
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,330
but I still go home thinking you know I
struggled a bit with that one oh I had

304
00:07:59,330 --> 00:07:59,340
struggled a bit with that one oh I had
 

305
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,749
struggled a bit with that one oh I had
such a good night but yeah I must work

306
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759
such a good night but yeah I must work
 

307
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,089
such a good night but yeah I must work
on my footwork or

308
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
on my footwork or
 

309
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,670
on my footwork or
so so

310
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:06,680
so so
 

311
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,950
so so
while enjoying our training we

312
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:09,960
while enjoying our training we
 

313
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,550
while enjoying our training we
constantly have the head of a student

314
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,560
constantly have the head of a student
 

315
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,610
constantly have the head of a student
on and we we make lots of mistakes while

316
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:19,620

 

317
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,670

doing good work as well

318
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
doing good work as well
 

319
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,689
doing good work as well
so the ego is how it's had a lot of fun

320
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:26,699
so the ego is how it's had a lot of fun
 

321
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,969
so the ego is how it's had a lot of fun
and and

322
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:28,979
and and
 

323
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,430
and and
I might

324
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
I might
 

325
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,050
I might
sort of think

326
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,060

 

327
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,750

that was such a busy class tonight

328
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:38,760
that was such a busy class tonight
 

329
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,250
that was such a busy class tonight
I found all our time to was breathe

330
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,260
I found all our time to was breathe
 

331
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,230
I found all our time to was breathe
I might have had the odd conversation

332
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
I might have had the odd conversation
 

333
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,250
I might have had the odd conversation
with my partner but on a busy night I I

334
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
with my partner but on a busy night I I
 

335
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,130
with my partner but on a busy night I I
used my time for getting my breath back

336
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,140
used my time for getting my breath back
 

337
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,630
used my time for getting my breath back
rather than having a chat about things

338
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
rather than having a chat about things
 

339
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,650
rather than having a chat about things
or discussing things

340
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:00,660

 

341
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,250

then I perhaps go on a seminar with this

342
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,260
then I perhaps go on a seminar with this
 

343
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,370
then I perhaps go on a seminar with this
