this I would feel his y energy so as I
 

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,550
this I would feel his y energy so as I
feel the Y energy that is telling me I

200
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
feel the Y energy that is telling me I
 

201
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,230

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,240
the spine definitely not on the other
 

449
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,550
the spine definitely not on the other
side you won't have the

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
side you won't have the
 

451
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,069
side you won't have the
engine capable of dealing with it the

452
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
engine capable of dealing with it the
 

453
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,389
engine capable of dealing with it the
pin his elbows on the front

qua and then I'll turn my tonden forward
 

465
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,269
qua and then I'll turn my tonden forward
down because it's K hole here which is

466
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:08,279
down because it's K hole here which is
 

467
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,990
down because it's K hole here which is
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin

468
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin
 

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,150
what it is it's K hole it's not a pin
because here in

470
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
because here in
 

471
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,350
because here in
modern this is nothing more than the

472
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,360
modern this is nothing more than the
 

473
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,550
modern this is nothing more than the
Kimura and nothing

474
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
Kimura and nothing
 

475
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,430
Kimura and nothing
stopping the forward

476
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
stopping the forward
 

477
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,350
stopping the forward
roll

478
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360

 

479
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,670

okay so for example if I was doing the

480
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
okay so for example if I was doing the
 

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,269
okay so for example if I was doing the
omop plaza which is the same thing I got

482
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
omop plaza which is the same thing I got
 

483
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,309
omop plaza which is the same thing I got
to stop that ability to roll then I get

484
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:36,319
to stop that ability to roll then I get
 

485
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,990
to stop that ability to roll then I get
the

486
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000

 

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,710

L this is coku

488
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
L this is coku
 

489
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,030
L this is coku
hole this is where I turn the

490
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,040
hole this is where I turn the
 

491
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,910
hole this is where I turn the
tanden into this forward

492
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:48,920
tanden into this forward
 

493
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,309
tanden into this forward
cycle

494
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:51,319
cycle
 

495
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,829
cycle
down okay so I turn the quaw and then I

496
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
down okay so I turn the quaw and then I
 

497
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,470
down okay so I turn the quaw and then I
drop

498
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480
drop
 

499
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,110
drop
it got it that's what I'm doing it's

500
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120

 

501
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,270

cul because it's

502
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
cul because it's
 

503
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,309
cul because it's
concentric then the the art is

504
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
concentric then the the art is
 

505
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,710
concentric then the the art is
concentric it is how to do a lock on the

506
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:13,720
concentric it is how to do a lock on the
 

507
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,949
concentric it is how to do a lock on the
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing

508
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing
 

509
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,590
shoulder mechanism so what I'm doing
here is not an

510
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:20,600

 

511
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,429

elbow but I'm going to take this scapula

512
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:24,439
elbow but I'm going to take this scapula
 

513
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,429
elbow but I'm going to take this scapula
mechanism move it

514
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
mechanism move it
 

515
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,029
mechanism move it
forward and down

going then I'll have a pin try to roll I
 

525
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,710
going then I'll have a pin try to roll I
can't

526
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
