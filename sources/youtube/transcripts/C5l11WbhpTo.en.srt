see so I don't have to rotate this is

126
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:01,830
see so I don't have to rotate this is
 

127
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,050

129
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,840
hiding it on the outside this hand is
just here so we're not going to do it

130
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:08,850
just here so we're not going to do it
 

131

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,940
just here just put it right there and
now you will to move around this time

136
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,950
now you will to move around this time
 

137
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,810
now you will to move around this time
slower okay so I don't want to ground

138
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:23,820
slower okay so I don't want to ground
 

139
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,659
slower okay so I don't want to ground
like the technique I just want you to

140
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:26,669
like the technique I just want you to
 

141
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,320

153
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,690

my technique he's out he's out there

154
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:12,700
my technique he's out he's out there
 

155
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,390
my technique he's out he's out there
he's bouncing so I'm going to put go

156
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
he's bouncing so I'm going to put go
 

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,130
he's bouncing so I'm going to put go
back to this fault

158
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,140
back to this fault
 

159
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:35,100
back to this fault
okay but it's not this so I'm not risk

160
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,110
okay but it's not this so I'm not risk
 

161
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,510
okay but it's not this so I'm not risk
torquing him down

162
