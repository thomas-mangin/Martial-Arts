1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,829

so

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:03,839
so
 

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,350
so
uh let's go over the sill

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,360
uh let's go over the sill
 

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,789
uh let's go over the sill
okay it's the

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:11,799
okay it's the
 

7
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,230
okay it's the
basics so we would be looking in the

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
basics so we would be looking in the
 

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,750
basics so we would be looking in the
same

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:15,760
same
 

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,349
same
direction

12
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359

 

13
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,029

okay my palm goes on the back of his

14
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:24,039
okay my palm goes on the back of his
 

15
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,550
okay my palm goes on the back of his
hand my fingers will come around the

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
hand my fingers will come around the
 

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,269
hand my fingers will come around the
front you're going to have to get up and

18
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:28,279
front you're going to have to get up and
 

19
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,189
front you're going to have to get up and
move around

20

move around
 

21
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,630
move around
my fingers will come around and be able

22
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
my fingers will come around and be able
 

23
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,310
my fingers will come around and be able
to have turning power pulling power for

24
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:39,320
to have turning power pulling power for
 

25
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,830
to have turning power pulling power for
the twist okay ah move yourself so

26
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
the twist okay ah move yourself so
 

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,150
the twist okay ah move yourself so
you're

28
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,160

 

29
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,709

comfortable don't if you dip your elbow

30
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:47,719
comfortable don't if you dip your elbow
 

31
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,670
comfortable don't if you dip your elbow
back it's going to hurt

32
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,680
back it's going to hurt
 

33
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,630
back it's going to hurt
okay then this

34
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
okay then this
 

35
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,830
okay then this

one couple things to never let

64
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
one couple things to never let
 

65
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,389
one couple things to never let
happen as as you're in the lock

66
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
happen as as you're in the lock
 

67
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,950
happen as as you're in the lock
proper never

68
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
proper never
 

69
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,230
proper never
lose the perpendicular angle to the

70
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
lose the perpendicular angle to the
 

71
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,149
lose the perpendicular angle to the
ground

72
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,159
ground
 

73
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,310
ground
no no never lose the verticality of the

74
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,320
no no never lose the verticality of the
 

75
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,350
no no never lose the verticality of the
elbow when you're in the lock proper so

76
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
elbow when you're in the lock proper so
 

77
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,350
elbow when you're in the lock proper so
don't let it dip down definitely do not

78
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
don't let it dip down definitely do not
 

79
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,950
don't let it dip down definitely do not
let it dip

80
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:05,960
let it dip
 

81
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,589
let it dip
back so you use

82
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:08,599
back so you use
 

83
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,910
back so you use
your internal and inertial engines to

84
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
your internal and inertial engines to
 

85
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,750
your internal and inertial engines to
keep that elbow in that position

86
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
keep that elbow in that position
 

87
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,550
keep that elbow in that position
okay so he tries to go forward no you'll

88
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,560
okay so he tries to go forward no you'll
 

89
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,910
okay so he tries to go forward no you'll
have your inertial engine try it slowly

90
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
have your inertial engine try it slowly
 

91
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,350
have your inertial engine try it slowly
so you don't hurt yourself so he can't

92
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,360
so you don't hurt yourself so he can't
 

93
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,229
so you don't hurt yourself so he can't
do it he tries to drop his elbow tries

94
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
do it he tries to drop his elbow tries
 

95
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,630
do it he tries to drop his elbow tries
to drop his elbow again you go and you

96
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,640
to drop his elbow again you go and you
 

97
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,509
to drop his elbow again you go and you
don't have your internal engines

98
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
don't have your internal engines
 

99
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,869
don't have your internal engines
traveling up the arm to stop

100
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
traveling up the arm to stop
 

101
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,309
traveling up the arm to stop
that the lock is like everything we do

102
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:41,319
that the lock is like everything we do
 

103
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,869
that the lock is like everything we do
here for example we just did Niko and

104
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:43,879
here for example we just did Niko and
 

105
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,910
here for example we just did Niko and
Niko's not in the

106
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
Niko's not in the
 

107
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,070
Niko's not in the
wrist so it looks like I'm trying to be

108
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
wrist so it looks like I'm trying to be
 

109
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,589
wrist so it looks like I'm trying to be
in the wrist but I'm

110
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,599
in the wrist but I'm
 

111
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,589
in the wrist but I'm
not I make contact here it goes up the

112
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,599
not I make contact here it goes up the
 

113
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,430
not I make contact here it goes up the
arm and it touches the

114
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,440
arm and it touches the
 

115
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,670
arm and it touches the
center it's the center move okay

116
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
center it's the center move okay
 

117
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,350
center it's the center move okay
do you understand all

118
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360

 

119
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,430

right so we don't want any play in his

120
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,440
right so we don't want any play in his
 

121
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,869
right so we don't want any play in his
wrist whenever you do the internal

122
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
wrist whenever you do the internal
 

123
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,710
wrist whenever you do the internal
engines you take out the slack in the

124
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:15,720
engines you take out the slack in the
 

125
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,190
engines you take out the slack in the
wrist all the time okay and you can't do

126
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
wrist all the time okay and you can't do
 

127
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,710
wrist all the time okay and you can't do
that if you attack the

128
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:21,720
that if you attack the
 

129
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,030
that if you attack the
wrist so

130
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,040
wrist so
 

131
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,789
wrist so
no

132
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:25,799
no

no
no just like put a guys

136
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
no just like put a guys
 

137

no just like put a guys
you no one should be be able to stand

138
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,000
you no one should be be able to stand
 

139
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,630
you no one should be be able to stand
still and I move this around this is all

140
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:35,640
still and I move this around this is all
 

141
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,789
still and I move this around this is all
incorrect

142
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:37,799
incorrect
 

143
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,949
incorrect
okay

144
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959
okay
 

145
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,190
okay
so some more it's it's a feeling it's

146
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,200
so some more it's it's a feeling it's
 

147
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,390
so some more it's it's a feeling it's
not that I'm cranking him and then

148
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
not that I'm cranking him and then
 

149
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,710
not that I'm cranking him and then
eventually I wind up his arm and get his

150
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
eventually I wind up his arm and get his
 

151
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,710
eventually I wind up his arm and get his
shoulders do you see that there's no

157
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,149
crank there's no crank right no so but
that's in his Center

158
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,159

 

159
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,190

do you

160
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,200
do you
 

161
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,270
do you
see so don't no you're actually losing

162
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,280
see so don't no you're actually losing
 

163
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,830

control and you're going to lose kazushi

164
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
control and you're going to lose kazushi
 

165
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,509

cuz it's only going to be in his
 

167
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,830
cuz it's only going to be in his
shoulder another point is to put my

168
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
shoulder another point is to put my
 

169
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,070
shoulder another point is to put my
hands where I told you to put my hand

170
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
hands where I told you to put my hand
 

171

so you won't be like this do you see
 

179
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,310
so you won't be like this do you see
that you won't have space

180
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
that you won't have space
 

181
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,070
that you won't have space
there and it is that lack of

182
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
there and it is that lack of

touch you're going to pay attention that
that Palm is ever so important not like

190
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
that Palm is ever so important not like
 

191
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,110
that Palm is ever so important not like
this so the same thing here see no space

body okay all right so let's get the

200
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
body okay all right so let's get the
 

201
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,029
body okay all right so let's get the
Palm right and let go of trying to hurt

202
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:22,039
Palm right and let go of trying to hurt
 

203
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,150

you start getting taller people doesn't

222
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,000
you start getting taller people doesn't
 

223
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,189
you start getting taller people doesn't
work

balance right now do you feel that
 

251
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,950
balance right now do you feel that
Tristan okay so I don't

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
Tristan okay so I don't
 

253
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,070
Tristan okay so I don't
slowly take a step in a different

254
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080

 

255
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,749

place do you see so this is what kazushi

256
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:46,759
place do you see so this is what kazushi
 

257
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,029
place do you see so this is what kazushi
is is that you have a center

258
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
is is that you have a center
 

259
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,029
is is that you have a center
okay and because you have a center even

260
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
okay and because you have a center even
 

261
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,670
okay and because you have a center even
though we're static he's actually not

262
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
though we're static he's actually not
 

263
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,749
though we're static he's actually not
mobile because I have his tandem okay

264
00:06:58,749 --> 00:06:58,759
mobile because I have his tandem okay
 

265
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,390
mobile because I have his tandem okay
it's just you usually we we move the

266
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,400
it's just you usually we we move the
 

267
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,150
it's just you usually we we move the
tent okay but it's not because I moved

268
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
tent okay but it's not because I moved
 

269
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,909
tent okay but it's not because I moved
it that I

270
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
it that I
 

271
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,869
it that I
actually uh took his balance it's

272
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:08,879
actually uh took his balance it's
 

273
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,950
actually uh took his balance it's
because I had seized the tonden

274
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
because I had seized the tonden
 

275
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,869
because I had seized the tonden
initially okay got it okay so he can't

276
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:14,879
initially okay got it okay so he can't
 

277
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,950
initially okay got it okay so he can't
grab my hand like and drop his elbow he

278
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:17,960
grab my hand like and drop his elbow he
 

279
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,749
grab my hand like and drop his elbow he
can okay but to that internal engine

280
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:20,759
can okay but to that internal engine
 

281
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,950
can okay but to that internal engine
We'll add inertial engines make it even

282
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
We'll add inertial engines make it even
 

283
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,270
We'll add inertial engines make it even
more difficult for someone to drop the

284
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
more difficult for someone to drop the
 

285
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,309
more difficult for someone to drop the
elbow okay all right so I I feel like

286
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
elbow okay all right so I I feel like
 

287
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,230
elbow okay all right so I I feel like
doing so I wasn't okay I I will just do

288
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
doing so I wasn't okay I I will just do
 

289
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,950
doing so I wasn't okay I I will just do
it from from EO okay so I'm going to

290
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:35,960
it from from EO okay so I'm going to
 

291
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,189
it from from EO okay so I'm going to
come

292
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
come
 

293
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,189
come
in and here's where you have that same

294
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:42,199
in and here's where you have that same
 

295
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,749
in and here's where you have that same
Center seizure with this adhesion here

296
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
Center seizure with this adhesion here
 

297
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,749
Center seizure with this adhesion here
okay so um just slow slowly so you could

298
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
okay so um just slow slowly so you could
 

299
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,589
okay so um just slow slowly so you could
feel it and they could see it it looks

300
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
feel it and they could see it it looks
 

301
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,749
feel it and they could see it it looks
like we're just standing here and I'm

302
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
like we're just standing here and I'm
 

303
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,309
like we're just standing here and I'm
pinning him okay but I'm not I have a

304
00:07:59,309 --> 00:07:59,319
pinning him okay but I'm not I have a
 

305
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,589
pinning him okay but I'm not I have a
Center again so if he tries to move

306
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:02,599
Center again so if he tries to move
 

307
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,430
Center again so if he tries to move
it'll you'll see it's making him fall do

308
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,440
it'll you'll see it's making him fall do
 

309
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,589
it'll you'll see it's making him fall do
you guys see that do you get it okay so

310
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
you guys see that do you get it okay so
 

311
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,189
you guys see that do you get it okay so
the kazushi is there it's important that

312
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,199
the kazushi is there it's important that
 

313
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,749
the kazushi is there it's important that
you use that and not this pin because

314
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
you use that and not this pin because
 

315
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,909
you use that and not this pin because
this I don't have you do do you feel

316
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
this I don't have you do do you feel
 

317
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,990
this I don't have you do do you feel
like I can pin him but he can get around

318
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
like I can pin him but he can get around
 

319
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,430
like I can pin him but he can get around
it get around it and don't have him okay

320
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
it get around it and don't have him okay
 

321
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,029
it get around it and don't have him okay
I would have to outow him so this is on

322
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
I would have to outow him so this is on
 

323
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,869
I would have to outow him so this is on
the

324
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:27,879
the
 

325
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,029
the
inside and just go one and move it

326
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:32,039
inside and just go one and move it
 

327
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,709
inside and just go one and move it
around and now you're exactly where you

328
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
around and now you're exactly where you
 

329
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,630
around and now you're exactly where you
were okay now I

330
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,640
were okay now I
 

331
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,310
were okay now I
trade control points from here to here

332
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
trade control points from here to here
 

333
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,070
trade control points from here to here
but it's going up his body moving his

334
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,080

 

335
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,470

Cent and then we have the same katama as

336
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
