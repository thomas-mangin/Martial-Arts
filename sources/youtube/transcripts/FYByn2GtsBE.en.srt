00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
i'm going to align
 

179
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,869
i'm going to align
my weight

180
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
my weight
 

181
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,470
my weight
as a resistance

182
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
as a resistance
 

183
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,750
as a resistance
you see as force is energy

184
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
you see as force is energy
 

185
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,789
you see as force is energy
on my midfoot

186
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
on my midfoot
 

187
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,990
on my midfoot
vector

188
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
vector
 

189
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,750
vector
your midfoot

190
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
your midfoot
 

191
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,309
your midfoot
is in the middle of your foot so

192
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
is in the middle of your foot so
 

193
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,270
is in the middle of your foot so
it's in

194
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
it's in
 

195
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,429
it's in
not on this side towards the big toe not

196
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
not on this side towards the big toe not
 

197
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,509
not on this side towards the big toe not
towards the little toe it is in the

198
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
towards the little toe it is in the
 

199
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,309
towards the little toe it is in the
middle of my foot

200
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
middle of my foot
 

201
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,550
middle of my foot
and it is slightly behind

202
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
and it is slightly behind
 

203
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,630
and it is slightly behind
where the ball of the foot is so you're

204
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
where the ball of the foot is so you're
 

205
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,270
where the ball of the foot is so you're
not on the ball of your foot

206
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280

 

207
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,349

it's right here

208
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
it's right here
 

209
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,830
it's right here
okay

210
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840

 

211
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,390

if you want you can think of it where

212
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
if you want you can think of it where
 

213
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,310
if you want you can think of it where
jesus got nailed

214
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
jesus got nailed
 

215
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,790
jesus got nailed
that's where it goes okay

216
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800

 

217
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950

i'm going to put my mass

218
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
i'm going to put my mass
 

219
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,230
i'm going to put my mass
my weight

220
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
my weight
 

221
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,150
my weight
because it's energy

222
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
because it's energy
 

223
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,110
because it's energy
i'm going to put it on that

224
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
i'm going to put it on that
 

225
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,189
i'm going to put it on that
alignment you're going to have to bend

226
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
alignment you're going to have to bend
 

227
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,790
alignment you're going to have to bend
your knees fix your head fix your arms

228
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
your knees fix your head fix your arms
 

229
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,310
your knees fix your head fix your arms
so that it stays

230
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
so that it stays
 

231
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,070
so that it stays
on there

232
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
on there
 

233
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,270
on there
okay

234
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280

 

235
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,390

this is gonna be drill one

236
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
this is gonna be drill one
 

237
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,150
this is gonna be drill one
you can move your arms and you're going

238
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
you can move your arms and you're going
 

239
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,189
you can move your arms and you're going
to see like if i don't adjust knees and

240
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
to see like if i don't adjust knees and
 

241
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,990
to see like if i don't adjust knees and
hips then it's coming off of that you

242
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
hips then it's coming off of that you
 

243
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,110
hips then it's coming off of that you
see that

244
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
see that
 

245
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,070
see that
so once you get it static

246
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
so once you get it static
 

247
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,270
so once you get it static
okay

248
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
okay
 

249
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,150
okay
there

250
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
there
 

251
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,469
there
i want you to slowly move and you're

252
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
i want you to slowly move and you're
 

253
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,310
i want you to slowly move and you're
going to have to move different parts of

254
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
going to have to move different parts of
 

255
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,350
going to have to move different parts of
your body to keep your weight

256
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
your body to keep your weight
 

257
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,350
your body to keep your weight
on that nail

258
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
on that nail
 

259
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,830
on that nail
do you understand you could you can go

260
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
do you understand you could you can go
 

261
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,189
do you understand you could you can go
really slow

262
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
really slow
 

263
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,230
really slow
you can move your head

264
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
you can move your head
 

265
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,110
you can move your head
but you want to keep the weight

266
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
but you want to keep the weight
 

267
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,029
but you want to keep the weight
always on that part

268
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
always on that part
 

269
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,430
always on that part
okay all right drill one

270
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440

 

271
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,270

so right now

272
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
so right now
 

273
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,270
so right now
your material mind is thinking oh yeah i

274
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
your material mind is thinking oh yeah i
 

275
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,670
your material mind is thinking oh yeah i
can stand straight over that

276
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
can stand straight over that
 

277
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,749
can stand straight over that
and it makes sense that the weight is

278
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
and it makes sense that the weight is
 

279
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,350
and it makes sense that the weight is
dropping down onto my mid foot but if

280
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
dropping down onto my mid foot but if
 

281
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,909
dropping down onto my mid foot but if
you pay attention this weight is not

282
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
you pay attention this weight is not
 

283
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,590
you pay attention this weight is not
over your midfoot which is why it's

284
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
over your midfoot which is why it's
 

285
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,950
over your midfoot which is why it's
starting to pull me over so i can take

286
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
starting to pull me over so i can take
 

287
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,430
starting to pull me over so i can take
this energy the resistance the weight

288
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
this energy the resistance the weight
 

289
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,150
this energy the resistance the weight
the gravitational pull on my hand

290
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
the gravitational pull on my hand
 

291
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,830
the gravitational pull on my hand
and i can

292
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
and i can
 

293
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,110
and i can
shift it onto my midfoot do you see such

294
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
shift it onto my midfoot do you see such
 

295
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,670
shift it onto my midfoot do you see such
that it's just pressing down my midfoot

296
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
that it's just pressing down my midfoot
 

297
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,350
that it's just pressing down my midfoot
now

298
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
now
 

299
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,670
now
you want to free your mind that you can

300
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
you want to free your mind that you can
 

301
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,189
you want to free your mind that you can
only align energy and straight lines

302
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
only align energy and straight lines
 

303
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,790
only align energy and straight lines
okay so that okay weight over mid foot

304
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
okay so that okay weight over mid foot
 

305
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,070
okay so that okay weight over mid foot
yeah okay no you were doing it just fine

306
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
yeah okay no you were doing it just fine
 

307
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,550
yeah okay no you were doing it just fine
the actual weight line is over here but

308
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
the actual weight line is over here but
 

309
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,029
the actual weight line is over here but
you move different parts of your body to

310
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
you move different parts of your body to
 

311
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,230
you move different parts of your body to
get back to mid-foot vector

312
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
get back to mid-foot vector
 

313
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,110
get back to mid-foot vector
in the same way

314
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
in the same way
 

315
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,629
in the same way
if i'm doing the shoulder press

316
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
if i'm doing the shoulder press
 

317
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,029
if i'm doing the shoulder press
and the bar is starting here

318
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
and the bar is starting here
 

319
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,469
and the bar is starting here
let's just get to the top

320
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479

 

321
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,390

you're like oh yeah i understand

322
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
you're like oh yeah i understand
 

323
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,629
you're like oh yeah i understand
midfield

324
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
midfield
 

325
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,309
midfield
but you can take the bar

326
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
but you can take the bar
 

327
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,070
but you can take the bar
and move and you're going to see if i

328
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
and move and you're going to see if i
 

329
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,390
and move and you're going to see if i
don't adjust what's going to happen

330
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
don't adjust what's going to happen
 

331
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,309
don't adjust what's going to happen
it's going to take me forward

332
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
it's going to take me forward
 

333
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,390
it's going to take me forward
so i can take again

334
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
so i can take again
 

335
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,309
so i can take again
and not

336
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
and not
 

337
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,189
and not
directly align force

338
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
directly align force
 

339
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,790
directly align force
and make it go

340
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
and make it go
 

341
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,230
and make it go
on my mid foot

342
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240

 

343
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,950

i can put it down the same way mid foot

344
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
i can put it down the same way mid foot
 

345
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,749
i can put it down the same way mid foot
mid foot mid foot i'll go off foot

346
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
mid foot mid foot i'll go off foot
 

347
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,189
mid foot mid foot i'll go off foot
calibration and watch what's gonna

348
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
calibration and watch what's gonna
 

349
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,950
calibration and watch what's gonna
happen you see

350
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
happen you see
 

351
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,589
happen you see
i calibrated still mid foot mid foot mid

352
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
i calibrated still mid foot mid foot mid
 

353
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,270

357
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,469

same thing goes on something a little

358
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
same thing goes on something a little
 

359
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,550
same thing goes on something a little
bit more dynamic it's now not linear

bit more dynamic it's now not linear
 

361
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,150
bit more dynamic it's now not linear
i do the same thing

362
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
i do the same thing
 

363
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,150
i do the same thing
pick it up

364
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
pick it up
 

365
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,550
pick it up
right now my weight is on my midfoot

if i stop calibrating it's going to make

368
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
if i stop calibrating it's going to make
 

369
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,350
if i stop calibrating it's going to make
me go forward mid foot

370

okay
 

381
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,070
okay
so force does not have to be

382
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
so force does not have to be
 

383
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,629
so force does not have to be
or energy does not have to be in a

or energy does not have to be in a
 

385
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:10,710
or energy does not have to be in a
direct alignment to midfoot okay

386
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720

 

387
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,070

here is energy his push

388
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080

 

389
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,510

i can align this energy

390
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
i can align this energy
 

391
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,469
i can align this energy
to go on the midfoot of the back leg

392
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
to go on the midfoot of the back leg
 

393
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,830
to go on the midfoot of the back leg
okay

394
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
okay
 

395
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,670
okay
so he's pushing

396
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
so he's pushing
 

397
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,469
so he's pushing
and i feel the back leg rounding

398
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
and i feel the back leg rounding
 

399
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,230
and i feel the back leg rounding
he's just pushing the back leg down

400
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
he's just pushing the back leg down
 

401
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,909
he's just pushing the back leg down
contrast

402
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
contrast
 

403
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,550
contrast
with that would be what i call a bracing

404
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
with that would be what i call a bracing
 

405
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,589
with that would be what i call a bracing
angle

406
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
angle
 

407
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,269
angle
here's where you have an exact opposite

408
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
here's where you have an exact opposite
 

409
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,630
here's where you have an exact opposite
energy

410
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640

pushing into him

412
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
pushing into him
 

413
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,910
pushing into him
you see that

414
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

 

415
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,630

that already you have left the arc

416
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
that already you have left the arc
 

417
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,350
that already you have left the arc
because this is a competing angle

418
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
because this is a competing angle
 

419
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,790
because this is a competing angle
that means i'm contesting him

420
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
that means i'm contesting him
 

421
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,190
that means i'm contesting him
when i have the internal aspect and he's

422
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
when i have the internal aspect and he's
 

423
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,470
when i have the internal aspect and he's
pushing

424
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480

 

425
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,829

do you see i'm not competing with him

426
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
do you see i'm not competing with him
 

427
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,310
do you see i'm not competing with him
his energy is passing through me and you

428
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
his energy is passing through me and you
 

429
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,590
his energy is passing through me and you
don't even need both legs down he's just

430
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
don't even need both legs down he's just
 

431
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,430
don't even need both legs down he's just
pushing me down

432
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
pushing me down
 

433
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,310
pushing me down
okay

434
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
okay
 

435
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,389
okay
do you see that

436
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
do you see that
 

437
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,150
do you see that
we'll go on the other side

438
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
we'll go on the other side
 

439
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,710
we'll go on the other side
to get it on both sides of our body so i

440
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
to get it on both sides of our body so i
 

441
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,870
to get it on both sides of our body so i
take this energy

442
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
take this energy
 

443
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,670
take this energy
just like the non-aligned vertical

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,990
down he's pushing me down
if i stop calibrating what's going to

456
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000

and
 

461
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,430
and
once you get yourself there you can test

462
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
once you get yourself there you can test
 

463
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,389
once you get yourself there you can test
for it

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
for it
 

465
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,389
for it
are you just pushing me down i can feel

466
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
are you just pushing me down i can feel
 

467
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,030
are you just pushing me down i can feel
oh wow it's getting heavier and then you

468
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
oh wow it's getting heavier and then you
 

469
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,710
oh wow it's getting heavier and then you
can see that you don't need

470
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
can see that you don't need
 

471
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,310
can see that you don't need
the front leg

472
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
the front leg
 

473
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,430
the front leg
okay

474
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
okay

if you look at this conceptually i can
 

487
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,230
if you look at this conceptually i can
take any

488
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
take any
 

489
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,910
take any
energy

490
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
energy
 

491
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,870

even the one any not aligned directly

492
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
even the one any not aligned directly
 

493
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,310
even the one any not aligned directly
with my midfoot

494

with my midfoot
 

495
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,710
with my midfoot
and transfer that weight

496
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
and transfer that weight
 

497
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,230

to my midfoot
 

499
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,910
to my midfoot
does that make sense

500
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
does that make sense
 

501
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,350
does that make sense
well

502
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
well
 

503
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,470
well
in the same way

504
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480

is not at all involved with the process
 

509

is not at all involved with the process
you can do

510
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
you can do
 

511
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,590
you can do
the same thing you could change it

512
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600

 

513
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,470

okay

514
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
okay
 

515
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,030
okay
do you see it if if i'm taking his

516
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
do you see it if if i'm taking his
 

517
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,590
do you see it if if i'm taking his
energy and grounding it it doesn't this

518
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
energy and grounding it it doesn't this
 

519
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,550
energy and grounding it it doesn't this
energy too of my posture

520

energy too of my posture
 

521
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,670
energy too of my posture
is not

522
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
is not
 

523
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,590
is not
what i'm dependent upon

524
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
what i'm dependent upon
 

525
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,269
what i'm dependent upon
okay but we're going to start with the

526
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
okay but we're going to start with the
 

527
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,269
okay but we're going to start with the
vessel

528
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
vessel
 

529
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,550
vessel
the introductory vessel keep your mass

530
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
the introductory vessel keep your mass
 

531
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,750
the introductory vessel keep your mass
pressed

532
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
pressed
 

533
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,269
pressed
onto the midfoot

534
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
onto the midfoot
 

535
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,269
onto the midfoot
then take his energy

536
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
then take his energy
 

537
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,269
then take his energy
and press it onto the midfoot of the

538
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
and press it onto the midfoot of the
 

539
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,110
and press it onto the midfoot of the
backflow okay

540
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
backflow okay
 

541
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,670
backflow okay
let's try it so there is another skill

542
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
let's try it so there is another skill
 

543
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,870
let's try it so there is another skill
that you need

544
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
that you need
 

545
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,350
that you need
prior to this but we're we're moving

546
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
prior to this but we're we're moving
 

547
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,829
prior to this but we're we're moving
into this part okay and one of them is

548
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
into this part okay and one of them is
 

549
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,470
into this part okay and one of them is
that you can actually hold your four

550
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
that you can actually hold your four
 

551
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,030
that you can actually hold your four
corners in relationship so i have my

552
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
corners in relationship so i have my
 

553
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,550
corners in relationship so i have my
hips and my shoulders are in

554
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
hips and my shoulders are in
 

555
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,790
hips and my shoulders are in
relationship and that you can extend

556
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
relationship and that you can extend
 

557
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,110
relationship and that you can extend
that down to your knee and your foot

558
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
that down to your knee and your foot
 

559
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,910
that down to your knee and your foot
okay so if i don't have that skill when

560
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
okay so if i don't have that skill when
 

561
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,150
okay so if i don't have that skill when
he goes to push he's turning me and the

562
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
he goes to push he's turning me and the
 

563
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,310
he goes to push he's turning me and the
energy's going around me it's a little

564
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
energy's going around me it's a little
 

565
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,470
energy's going around me it's a little
harder for us

566
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
harder for us
 

567
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,630
harder for us
that can't keep our four corners in

568
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
that can't keep our four corners in
 

569
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,910
that can't keep our four corners in
alignment or

570
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
alignment or
 

571
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,870
alignment or
in relationship to ground the energy

572
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
in relationship to ground the energy
 

573
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,190
in relationship to ground the energy
here because it's spilling out through

574
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
here because it's spilling out through
 

575
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,509
here because it's spilling out through
my right shoulder you see that spill

576
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
my right shoulder you see that spill
 

577
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,990
my right shoulder you see that spill
that energy is supposed to go here

578
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
that energy is supposed to go here
 

579
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,230
that energy is supposed to go here
okay

580
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
okay
 

581
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,350
okay
um

582
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360

 

583
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,470

his energy is going down his energy is

584
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
his energy is going down his energy is
 

585
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,389
his energy is going down his energy is
coming in and going down just like the

586
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
coming in and going down just like the
 

587
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,230
coming in and going down just like the
energy of my

588
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
energy of my
 

589
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,030
energy of my
mass is going down his energy's doing

590
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
mass is going down his energy's doing
 

591
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,949
mass is going down his energy's doing
the same thing

592
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
the same thing
 

593
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,750
the same thing
it is hitting a superior body

594
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
it is hitting a superior body
 

595
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,269
it is hitting a superior body
the planet

596
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
the planet
 

597
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,550
the planet
okay

598
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
okay
 

599
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,470
okay
it is going to be the energy that is

600
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
it is going to be the energy that is
 

601
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,590
it is going to be the energy that is
displaced

602
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
displaced
 

603
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,670
displaced
not the planet i'm not gonna move the

604
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
not the planet i'm not gonna move the
 

605
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,790
not the planet i'm not gonna move the
planet okay so it's very much similar to

606
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
planet okay so it's very much similar to
 

607
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,230
planet okay so it's very much similar to
a ball that hits a superior mass

608
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
a ball that hits a superior mass
 

609
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,230
a ball that hits a superior mass
it'll change directions

610
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
it'll change directions
 

611
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,829
it'll change directions
okay

612
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
okay
 

613
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,829
okay
in the same way

614
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
in the same way
 

615
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,550
in the same way
that i can take any energy not just one

616
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
that i can take any energy not just one
 

617
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,190
that i can take any energy not just one
in direct alignment but oriented back on

618
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
in direct alignment but oriented back on
 

619
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,910
in direct alignment but oriented back on
the midfoot i can take that rebounding

620
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
the midfoot i can take that rebounding
 

621
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,949
the midfoot i can take that rebounding
energy and rebound it at any angle that

622
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
energy and rebound it at any angle that
 

623
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,710
energy and rebound it at any angle that
i need okay

624
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
i need okay
 

625
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,629
i need okay
but we're going to start with the easy

626
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
but we're going to start with the easy
 

627
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,590
but we're going to start with the easy
one

628
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
one
 

629
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,910
one
just straight back out just like this

630
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
just straight back out just like this
 

631
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,550
just straight back out just like this
ball is doing it

632
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
ball is doing it
 

633
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,790
ball is doing it
unlike the ball i have lots of joints

634
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
unlike the ball i have lots of joints
 

635
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,870
unlike the ball i have lots of joints
and fluids and things like that and

636
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
and fluids and things like that and
 

637
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,230
and fluids and things like that and
that's why i could do something

638
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
that's why i could do something
 

639
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,389
that's why i could do something
different than the ball could do

640
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
different than the ball could do
 

641
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,790
different than the ball could do
if you change this ball so it's not like

642
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
if you change this ball so it's not like
 

643
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,629
if you change this ball so it's not like
this shape and it has many different

644
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
this shape and it has many different
 

645
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,310
this shape and it has many different
angles you're going to see that it too

646
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
angles you're going to see that it too
 

647
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,710
angles you're going to see that it too
can change the angle different from how

648
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
can change the angle different from how
 

649
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,509
can change the angle different from how
it hit the ground okay

650
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
it hit the ground okay
 

651
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,350
it hit the ground okay
so

652
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
so
 

653
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,430
so
i'm going to aim the energy that he's

654
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
i'm going to aim the energy that he's
 

655
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,430
i'm going to aim the energy that he's
given me

656
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
given me
 

657
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,230
given me
it's going down down and i'm holding it

658
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
it's going down down and i'm holding it
 

659
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,750
it's going down down and i'm holding it
down because i'm the one that's putting

660
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
down because i'm the one that's putting
 

661
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,350
down because i'm the one that's putting
it on the midfoot

662
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
it on the midfoot
 

663
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,269
it on the midfoot
i'm going to aim it back through his

664
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
i'm going to aim it back through his
 

665
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,430
i'm going to aim it back through his
center

666
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
center
 

667
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,269
center
i'm just going to shift my weight

668
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279

 

669
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,430

so again

670
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
so again
 

671
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,910
so again
if he's coming at me and i shove him

672
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
if he's coming at me and i shove him
 

673
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,230
if he's coming at me and i shove him
back that would be contestation because

674
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
back that would be contestation because
 

675
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,590
back that would be contestation because
that's my energy against his energy

676
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
that's my energy against his energy
 

677
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,069
that's my energy against his energy
but in pre-modern understanding

678
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
but in pre-modern understanding
 

679
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,310
but in pre-modern understanding
that was when i projected him that was

680
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
that was when i projected him that was
 

681
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,870
that was when i projected him that was
his energy not my energy so technically

682
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
his energy not my energy so technically
 

683
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,790
his energy not my energy so technically
i'm not contesting him

684
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
i'm not contesting him
 

685
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,189
i'm not contesting him
okay

686
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199

 

687
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,870

so it's his energy

688
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
so it's his energy
 

689
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,790
so it's his energy
let it go down

690
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
let it go down
 

691
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,910
let it go down
and then as you go to move forward

692
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
and then as you go to move forward
 

693
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,870
and then as you go to move forward
that's more energy make that energy go

694
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
that's more energy make that energy go
 

695
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,389
that's more energy make that energy go
down and conjoin with his energy and now

696
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
down and conjoin with his energy and now
 

697
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,750
down and conjoin with his energy and now
you can

698
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
you can
 

699
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,949
you can
project out

700
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
project out
 

701
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,350
project out
if you go like this

702
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
if you go like this
 

703
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,829
if you go like this
that's going to be contestation that's

704
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
that's going to be contestation that's
 

705
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,189
that's going to be contestation that's
material okay not energetic i want like

706
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
material okay not energetic i want like
 

707
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,150
material okay not energetic i want like
the ball the ball did not compress and

708
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
the ball the ball did not compress and
 

709
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,870
the ball the ball did not compress and
get ready to bounce you see the ball

710
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
get ready to bounce you see the ball
 

711
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,030
get ready to bounce you see the ball
just stayed the ball and let the earth

712
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
just stayed the ball and let the earth
 

713
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,230
just stayed the ball and let the earth
displace it same thing here he pushes

714
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
displace it same thing here he pushes
 

715
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,949
displace it same thing here he pushes
he's pushing down and boom

716
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959

 

717
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,350

boom

719
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,910

keep it at at this uh

720
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
keep it at at this uh
 

721
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,550
keep it at at this uh
visible a level for now okay

722
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
visible a level for now okay
 

723
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,870
visible a level for now okay
you're he's pushing down take your

724
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
you're he's pushing down take your
 

725
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,230
you're he's pushing down take your
movement down two and then

726
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
movement down two and then
 

727
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,990
movement down two and then
push on to that

728
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
push on to that
 

729
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,509
push on to that
ground pattern

730
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
ground pattern
 

731
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,310
ground pattern
uh and you're gonna get him to displace

732
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
uh and you're gonna get him to displace
 

733
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,870
uh and you're gonna get him to displace
okay all right let's try that

734
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
okay all right let's try that
 

735
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,750
okay all right let's try that
um again this is a vessel of

736
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
um again this is a vessel of
 

737
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,949
um again this is a vessel of
introduction right it's not self-defense

738
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
introduction right it's not self-defense
 

739
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,550
introduction right it's not self-defense
so you don't have to go through a group

740
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
so you don't have to go through a group
 

741
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,750
so you don't have to go through a group
you liked

742
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
you liked
 

743
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,550
you liked
okay you stand there like that

744
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560

 

745
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,389

that is just idiotic

746
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
that is just idiotic
 

747
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,629
that is just idiotic
okay

748
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
okay
 

749
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,069
okay
what i'm doing is simplifying

750
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
what i'm doing is simplifying
 

751
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,030
what i'm doing is simplifying
and idealizing

752
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
and idealizing
 

753
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,790
and idealizing
the environment for skill development

754
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
the environment for skill development
 

755
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,350
the environment for skill development
okay that's what you're doing

756
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
okay that's what you're doing
 

757
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,470
okay that's what you're doing
so he's not an opponent

758
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
so he's not an opponent
 

759
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,629
so he's not an opponent
he's not someone that's trying to grab

760
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
he's not someone that's trying to grab
 

761
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,629
he's not someone that's trying to grab
me to punch me

762
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
me to punch me
 

763
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,470
me to punch me
he's not even someone who likes and

764
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
he's not even someone who likes and
 

765
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,870
he's not even someone who likes and
wants to hold my hand he's not he is no

766
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
wants to hold my hand he's not he is no
 

767
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,150
wants to hold my hand he's not he is no
different

768
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
different
 

769
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,670
different
than the ball

770
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
than the ball
 

771
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,150
than the ball
or the barbell

772
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
or the barbell
 

773
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,710
or the barbell
do you see i didn't the barbell at the

774
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
do you see i didn't the barbell at the
 

775
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,990
do you see i didn't the barbell at the
ball had no emotional investment

776
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
ball had no emotional investment
 

777
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,670
ball had no emotional investment
in me

778
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
in me
 

779
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,430
in me
it's just a tool

780
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
it's just a tool
 

781
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,069
it's just a tool
okay

782
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079

 

783
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,949

if you when you go let's say here oh

784
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
if you when you go let's say here oh
 

785
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,189
if you when you go let's say here oh
this looks like what i know this looks

786
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
this looks like what i know this looks
 

787
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,670
this looks like what i know this looks
like what i know right it's the same

788
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
like what i know right it's the same
 

789
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,870
like what i know right it's the same
thing i i have my energy

790
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
thing i i have my energy
 

791
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,350
thing i i have my energy
i would have his energy you see that's

792
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
i would have his energy you see that's
 

793
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,629
i would have his energy you see that's
his mass

794
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
his mass
 

795
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,790
his mass
i'm going to send that energy down into

796
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
i'm going to send that energy down into
 

797
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,030
i'm going to send that energy down into
the ground and i i would use that boo

798
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
the ground and i i would use that boo
 

799
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,389
the ground and i i would use that boo
to do the same exact projection

800
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
to do the same exact projection
 

801
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,870
to do the same exact projection
do you see and now now the idiot can go

802
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
do you see and now now the idiot can go
 

803
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,550
do you see and now now the idiot can go
i recognize that

804
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
i recognize that
 

805
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,350
i recognize that
okay

806
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
okay
 

807
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,269
okay
but you can't do it

808
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
but you can't do it
 

809
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,350
but you can't do it
because all you would do is hit the

810
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
because all you would do is hit the
 

811
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,990
because all you would do is hit the
surface of the guy with shoulder muscle

812
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
surface of the guy with shoulder muscle
 

813
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,829
surface of the guy with shoulder muscle
strength hip rotation okay

814
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
strength hip rotation okay
 

815
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,350
strength hip rotation okay
this is how you learn it

816
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360

 

817
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,030

so he is more like a very sophisticated

818
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
so he is more like a very sophisticated
 

819
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,590
so he is more like a very sophisticated
slam ball or barbell

820
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
slam ball or barbell
 

821
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,030
slam ball or barbell
okay

822
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
okay
 

823
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,550
okay
so he's giving me energy

824
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
so he's giving me energy
 

825
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,550
so he's giving me energy
he's pushing down

826
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
he's pushing down
 

827
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,390
he's pushing down
he's very alive

828
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
he's very alive
 

829
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,870
he's very alive
and i have to there's all this micro

830
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
and i have to there's all this micro
 

831
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,270
and i have to there's all this micro
shifting that's happening in him and all

832
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
shifting that's happening in him and all
 

833
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,429
shifting that's happening in him and all
that has to go down i don't have to do

834
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
that has to go down i don't have to do
 

835
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,829
that has to go down i don't have to do
that with the ball or barbell you see

836
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
that with the ball or barbell you see
 

837
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,909
that with the ball or barbell you see
this is a much more sophisticated

838
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
this is a much more sophisticated
 

839
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,510
this is a much more sophisticated
training device

840
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
training device
 

841
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,829
training device
so when i go to displays

842
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
so when i go to displays
 

843
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,789
so when i go to displays
he's not an opponent he's a resistance

844
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
he's not an opponent he's a resistance
 

845
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,230
he's not an opponent he's a resistance
he's energy

846
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
he's energy
 

847
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,590
he's energy
and i displace that

848
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600

 

849
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,430

obviously you can see the energy

850
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
obviously you can see the energy
 

851
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,029
obviously you can see the energy
projecting into him

852
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
projecting into him
 

853
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,470
projecting into him
if he

854
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
if he
 

855
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,950
if he
will do it we'll switch it

856
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
will do it we'll switch it
 

857
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,750
will do it we'll switch it
okay i'm the training energy

858
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
okay i'm the training energy
 

859
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,990
okay i'm the training energy
i'm getting him i can feel he put he's

860
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
i'm getting him i can feel he put he's
 

861
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,510
i'm getting him i can feel he put he's
in the ground now i'm just pushing on

862
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
in the ground now i'm just pushing on
 

863
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,990
in the ground now i'm just pushing on
the planet right now and he goes to do

864
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
the planet right now and he goes to do
 

865
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,710
the planet right now and he goes to do
it

866
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
it
 

867
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,710
it
and i go like this

868
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
and i go like this
 

869
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,190
and i go like this
do you see i absorb the energy of my

870
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
do you see i absorb the energy of my
 

871
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,230
do you see i absorb the energy of my
shoulder and my elbow do you get it

872
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
shoulder and my elbow do you get it
 

873
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,029
shoulder and my elbow do you get it
so

874
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
so
 

875
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,070
so
the duration at which he projects my

876
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
the duration at which he projects my
 

877
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,350
the duration at which he projects my
mass

878
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
mass
 

879
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,909
mass
is about

880
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919

 

881
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,830

maybe that long

882
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
maybe that long
 

883
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,230
maybe that long
i'll show you what i mean so that's the

884
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
i'll show you what i mean so that's the
 

885
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,630
i'll show you what i mean so that's the
question is how long is he doing the

886
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
question is how long is he doing the
 

887
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,310
question is how long is he doing the
drill

888
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
drill
 

889
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,549
drill
is related to how much skill he's

890
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
is related to how much skill he's
 

891
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,870
is related to how much skill he's
developing it would be the difference

892
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
developing it would be the difference
 

893
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,830
developing it would be the difference
between you train one hour once a week

894
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
between you train one hour once a week
 

895
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,990
between you train one hour once a week
or you train six hours a day you're

896
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
or you train six hours a day you're
 

897
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,909
or you train six hours a day you're
going to get more repetitions in the

898
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
going to get more repetitions in the
 

899
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,750
going to get more repetitions in the
drill you're going to be much more

900
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
drill you're going to be much more
 

901
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,870
drill you're going to be much more
skilled so if his

902
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
skilled so if his
 

903
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,110
skilled so if his
actual drill

904
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
actual drill
 

905
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,230
actual drill
is

906
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
is
 

907
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,990
is
try to go slow

908
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
try to go slow
 

909
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,830
try to go slow
so he's got my mask now he's going to

910
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
so he's got my mask now he's going to
 

911
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,390
so he's got my mask now he's going to
put my mass his mass and his movement

912
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
put my mass his mass and his movement
 

913
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,350
put my mass his mass and his movement
energy

914
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
energy
 

915
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,710
energy
into that stain that's about it

916
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
into that stain that's about it
 

917
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,549
into that stain that's about it
then i start to go like this he's not in

918
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
then i start to go like this he's not in
 

919
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,830
then i start to go like this he's not in
the drill anymore

920
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
the drill anymore
 

921
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,789
