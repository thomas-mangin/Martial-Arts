1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:09,190

um

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200

 

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,749

this part

4
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
this part
 

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,509
this part
let us let us uh put her on a grid

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
let us let us uh put her on a grid
 

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,029
let us let us uh put her on a grid
okay

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
okay
 

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,070
okay
you see the orientation of her spine

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
you see the orientation of her spine
 

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,029
you see the orientation of her spine
okay

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
okay
 

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,790
okay
and you know

14
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:21,800
and you know
 

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,950
and you know
[Music]

16
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
[Music]
 

17
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,349
[Music]
that at the end of ikyoura

18
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
that at the end of ikyoura
 

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,390
that at the end of ikyoura
you want her to not be turtle

20
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
you want her to not be turtle
 

21
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,549
you want her to not be turtle
you see there's two ways of doing it

22
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
you see there's two ways of doing it
 

23
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,350
you see there's two ways of doing it
there's the ego tripartite way

24
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
there's the ego tripartite way
 

25
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,310
there's the ego tripartite way
where you're gonna go forward

26
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
where you're gonna go forward
 

27
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,670
where you're gonna go forward
see that

28
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
see that
 

29
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,310
see that
i'll do that part so in other words i'm

30
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
i'll do that part so in other words i'm
 

31
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,950
i'll do that part so in other words i'm
gonna take her on the vector her spine

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
gonna take her on the vector her spine
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,630
gonna take her on the vector her spine
is currently on

34
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
is currently on
 

35
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,110
is currently on
okay

36
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120

 

37
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,590

and you're here

38
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
and you're here
 

39
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,189
and you're here
you go like that okay

40
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199

 

41
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,630

ready

42
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640

 

43
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,709

second way

44
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719

 

45
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,590

is

46
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
is
 

47
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,509
is
let's orient ourselves how we work

48
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
let's orient ourselves how we work
 

49
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,870
let's orient ourselves how we work
before

50
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
before
 

51
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,789
before
bring back

52
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
bring back
 

53
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,310
bring back
okay

54
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
okay
 

55
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,670
okay
there it is

56
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
there it is
 

57
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,990
there it is
i'm not going to lengthen her in the

58
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
i'm not going to lengthen her in the
 

59
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,429
i'm not going to lengthen her in the
obvious way

60
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
obvious way
 

61
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,270
obvious way
on the same vector her spine is

62
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
on the same vector her spine is
 

63
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,830
on the same vector her spine is
i'm going to turn her relax

64
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
i'm going to turn her relax
 

65
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,109
i'm going to turn her relax
leave it out

66
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
leave it out
 

67
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,030
leave it out
i'm going to turn her

68
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040

 

69
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,550

this way

70
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
this way
 

71
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,910
this way
she's not turtle

72
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
she's not turtle
 

73
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,870
she's not turtle
come back

74
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880

 

75
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,630

and that is your aikido geometry

76
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
and that is your aikido geometry
 

77
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,069
and that is your aikido geometry
some of you will go here

78
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
some of you will go here
 

79
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,670
some of you will go here
is she

80
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
is she
 

81
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,990
is she
is she uh

82
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
is she uh
 

83
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,670
is she uh
prone no

84
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
prone no
 

85
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,510
prone no
and now you go like this

86
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520

 

87
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,830

so it's in

88
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
so it's in
 

89
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,389
so it's in
between

90
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
between
 

91
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,030
between
but in between is still incorrect

92
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
but in between is still incorrect
 

93
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,389
but in between is still incorrect
okay

94
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
okay
 

95
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,469
okay
so

96
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
so
 

97
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,670
so
and we do this

98
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680

 

99
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,510

you keep turning how far should you turn

100
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
you keep turning how far should you turn
 

101
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,790
you keep turning how far should you turn
as far as it needs for her to

102
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
as far as it needs for her to
 

103
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,430
as far as it needs for her to
lose the turtle position

104
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
lose the turtle position
 

105
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,470
lose the turtle position
you can't usually what happens is that

106
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
you can't usually what happens is that
 

107
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,070
you can't usually what happens is that
you uh

108
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
you uh
 

109
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,589
you uh
go this is my style

110
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
go this is my style
 

111
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,229
go this is my style
is that it's not your style okay

112
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
is that it's not your style okay
 

113
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,030
is that it's not your style okay
it's uh

114
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040

 

115
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,670

around

116
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680

 

117
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,790

there

118
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
there
 

119
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
there
okay

120
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
okay
 

121
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,470
okay
and then through that

122
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
and then through that
 

123
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,350
and then through that
you add

124
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
you add
 

125
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,630
you add
the

126
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
the
 

127
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,110
the
final form requirement

128
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
final form requirement
 

129
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,790
final form requirement
which is i have to bring it around

130
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800

 

131
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,710

and end up

132
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
and end up
 

133
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,390
and end up
with the hand head level

134
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
with the hand head level
 

135
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,990
with the hand head level
and my knee at her armpit

136
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
and my knee at her armpit
 

137
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,309
and my knee at her armpit
and my wrist and my other knee at her

138
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
and my wrist and my other knee at her
 

139
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,110
and my wrist and my other knee at her
wrist

140
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
wrist
 

141
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,270
wrist
okay this is where we land

142
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280

 

143
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,430

and that's going to tell you

144
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
and that's going to tell you
 

145
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,589
and that's going to tell you
what's too far

146
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
what's too far
 

147
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,309
what's too far
what's not far enough still turtle and

148
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
what's not far enough still turtle and
 

149
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,550
what's not far enough still turtle and
now along the vector the spine is

150
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
now along the vector the spine is
 

151
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,910
now along the vector the spine is
already on what is too far

152
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
already on what is too far
 

153
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,949
already on what is too far
is

154
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
is
 

155
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,430
is
when the hand comes back down

156
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
when the hand comes back down
 

157
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,949
when the hand comes back down
around

158
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
around
 

159
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,470
around
around

160
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
around
 

161
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,309
around
you see

162
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
you see
 

163
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,990
you see
it's supposed to be here so when you

164
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
it's supposed to be here so when you
 

165
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,869
it's supposed to be here so when you
have to make this correction

166
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
have to make this correction
 

167
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:41,190
have to make this correction
we did the technical

168
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200

 

169
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,309

got it

170
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
got it
 

171
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,869
got it
okay

172
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879

 

173
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,110

okay what i'm trying to tell you

174
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120

 

175
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,070

is that it ends you see

176
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
is that it ends you see
 

177
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,750
is that it ends you see
it it all stops at once

178
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
it it all stops at once
 

179
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,149
it it all stops at once
if i'm doing it right it's not just

180
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
if i'm doing it right it's not just
 

181
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,390
if i'm doing it right it's not just
a last portrait

182
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
a last portrait
 

183
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,309
a last portrait
that deems that i did the technique

184
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
that deems that i did the technique
 

185
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,110

those variations
where you go this way

196
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
where you go this way
 

197
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,830
where you go this way
and you give yourself that correction

198
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and you give yourself that correction
 

199
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,510
and you give yourself that correction
you want to understand that is incorrect

200
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520

your teacher is going to go what the
 

209
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,870
your teacher is going to go what the
do you get but that is as much deviation

210
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
do you get but that is as much deviation

and you're going to do half
 

225
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,430
and you're going to do half
