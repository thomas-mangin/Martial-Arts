that's not many people
 

83
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,429
that's not many people
and I would say

and I would say
 

85
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,290
and I would say
that's probably

91
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,770

you can

92
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:23,780
you can
 

93
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,170
you can
frustrate people not using the tactic

94
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,180
frustrate people not using the tactic
 

95
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,710
frustrate people not using the tactic
into using the tactic and I explained

96
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
into using the tactic and I explained
 

97
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,550
into using the tactic and I explained
how that

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,350
by moving
in a particular pattern a spiral pattern

in a particular pattern a spiral pattern
 

103
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,229
in a particular pattern a spiral pattern
at the commencement of their intention

104

then they not being able to reach you
 

107
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,229
then they not being able to reach you
and behind you they're behind you on the

spiral pattern
will attempt to reach across

112
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
will attempt to reach across
 

113
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,250
will attempt to reach across
when they reach across

114
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,260
when they reach across
 

115
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,190
when they reach across
they're going to first be closed because

116
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
they're going to first be closed because
 

117
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,630
they're going to first be closed because
they're going to try to get as close as

118
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
they're going to try to get as close as
 

119
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,369
they're going to try to get as close as
they can

120
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:10,379
they can
 

121
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,290
they can
but they're also going to be out of body

122
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:12,300
but they're also going to be out of body
 

123
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,530
but they're also going to be out of body
alignment okay so as I showed yesterday

124
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:15,540
alignment okay so as I showed yesterday
 

125
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,130
alignment okay so as I showed yesterday
let's have this foot forward

126
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,140
let's have this foot forward
 

127
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,670
let's have this foot forward
here is where the proper body alignment

128
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
here is where the proper body alignment
 

129
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,729
here is where the proper body alignment
is for showmanucci

130
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:25,739
is for showmanucci
 

131
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,570
is for showmanucci
but the person attacking had this body

132
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:29,580
but the person attacking had this body
 

133
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,070
but the person attacking had this body
alignment

alignment
 

135
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,410
alignment
this creates openings

136
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,420
this creates openings
 

137
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,729
this creates openings
or as I showed you when he was kicking

138
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:37,739
or as I showed you when he was kicking
 

139
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,670
or as I showed you when he was kicking
it happened over here on the mat lift

140
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
it happened over here on the mat lift
 

141
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,550
it happened over here on the mat lift
your foot up he's throwing a front kick

142
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,560
your foot up he's throwing a front kick
 

143
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,210
your foot up he's throwing a front kick
but I was traveling this way

144
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,220
but I was traveling this way
 

145
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,030
but I was traveling this way
and he attempted to reach across but

146
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,040
and he attempted to reach across but
 

147
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,750
and he attempted to reach across but
momentum's going that way that is a

148
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
momentum's going that way that is a
 

149
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,570
momentum's going that way that is a
poorly executed kick but it's done out

150
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,580
poorly executed kick but it's done out
 

151
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,949
poorly executed kick but it's done out
of frustration

152
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959

 

153
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,430

you can also frustrate somebody

154
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,440
you can also frustrate somebody
 

155
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,190
you can also frustrate somebody
who is attempting not to finally

156
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
who is attempting not to finally
 

157
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,930
who is attempting not to finally
displace

158
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:08,940
displace
 

159
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,809
displace
by coming in methodically

160
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:11,819
by coming in methodically
 

161
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,229
by coming in methodically
so for example in Judo because there's

162
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
so for example in Judo because there's
 

163
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,930
so for example in Judo because there's
no strikes you'll see people come in

164
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:17,940
no strikes you'll see people come in
 

165
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,710
no strikes you'll see people come in
methodically and grab different things

166
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:21,720
methodically and grab different things
 

167
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,110
methodically and grab different things
once you put the Strikes Back In you

168
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,120
once you put the Strikes Back In you
 

169
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,870
once you put the Strikes Back In you
can't do that anymore you he's going to

170
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
can't do that anymore you he's going to
 

171
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,210
can't do that anymore you he's going to
punch me in the face

172
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,220
punch me in the face
 

173
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,189
punch me in the face
you got to get past those strikes

174
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,199

 

175
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,850

so by making people pay for bridging too

so in that one where we had the

because I'm spiraling this way but his

246
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
because I'm spiraling this way but his
 

247
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,249
because I'm spiraling this way but his
momentum was going that way he starts to

momentum was going that way he starts to
 

249
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,870
momentum was going that way he starts to
turn towards me

250
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880

he's behind me on the spiral but here's

he's behind me on the spiral but here's
 

253
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,850
he's behind me on the spiral but here's
where I touched it and that's where the

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:25,860
where I touched it and that's where the
 

255

but I don't make it

so we're going to do a progression drill

266

it doesn't necessarily mean you're out

942
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,500
it doesn't necessarily mean you're out
 

943
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,649

so if I was successful at no point as he

954
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
so if I was successful at no point as he
 

955
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,289
so if I was successful at no point as he
came in did his Center stop

came in did his Center stop
 

957
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:46,669
came in did his Center stop
see and then I did my technique
