00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:05,030

all right um one of the things that we

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
all right um one of the things that we
 

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,310
all right um one of the things that we
do is we always use the angle so take

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
do is we always use the angle so take
 

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,990
do is we always use the angle so take
the body at an angle take the body at an

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
the body at an angle take the body at an
 

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,710
the body at an angle take the body at an
angle those are your back position at

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:17,720
angle those are your back position at
 

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,790
angle those are your back position at
the

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
the
 

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,269
the
angle and then when you go forward take

12
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:22,279
angle and then when you go forward take
 

13
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,230
angle and then when you go forward take
the body at an

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
the body at an
 

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,669
the body at an
angle take the body at an

16
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:27,679
angle take the body at an
 

17
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,470
angle take the body at an
angle what we don't do

18
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
angle what we don't do
 

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,030
angle what we don't do
is try to bend the body in

20
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
is try to bend the body in
 

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,029
is try to bend the body in
half bend the body in half or try to

22
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:39,039
half bend the body in half or try to
 

23
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,630
half bend the body in half or try to
lift this way even on koshen net if you

lift this way even on koshen net if you
 

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,110
lift this way even on koshen net if you
pay attention once you add the spiring

it because easier to tilt do you

86
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200

point it's not that my elbow hits him in

110
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,560
point it's not that my elbow hits him in
 

111
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,070
point it's not that my elbow hits him in
the face or he doesn't want to get H in

112
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
the face or he doesn't want to get H in
 

113
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,070
the face or he doesn't want to get H in
the face so he backs up and bends over

114
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,080
the face so he backs up and bends over
 

115
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,990
the face so he backs up and bends over
you

116
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
you
 

117
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,509
you
understand so I get this adhesion point

118
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,519
understand so I get this adhesion point
 

119
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,149
understand so I get this adhesion point
and that adhesion Point tilts

120
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
and that adhesion Point tilts
 

121
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,429
and that adhesion Point tilts
him you see that tilt

122
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
him you see that tilt
 

123
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,350
him you see that tilt
so same thing if he is asocially violent

124
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
so same thing if he is asocially violent
 

125
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,589
so same thing if he is asocially violent
the center will be automatically engaged

the center will be automatically engaged
it will not Bend so if he locked his

128
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
it will not Bend so if he locked his
 

129
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,949
it will not Bend so if he locked his
Center consciously now lock it I cannot

130
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
Center consciously now lock it I cannot
 

131
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,030
Center consciously now lock it I cannot
bend him but I sure as heck can tilt

132
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
bend him but I sure as heck can tilt
 

133
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,429
bend him but I sure as heck can tilt
him do you

134
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
him do you
 

135
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,750
him do you
understand okay

136
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
understand okay
 

137
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,509

so how do we tilt him

138
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:00,519
so how do we tilt him
 

139
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,429
so how do we tilt him

fast they're not going to see it okay so
one rock around

172
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
one rock around
 

173
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,830
one rock around
in and basically he's going War around

174
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:02,840
in and basically he's going War around
 

175
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,189
in and basically he's going War around
back and into it okay now I have to do

176
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:06,199
back and into it okay now I have to do
 

177
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,189
back and into it okay now I have to do
that with C hle bring him into here

178
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199

 

179
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,749

Bo and do it with one arm in this side

180
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:20,759

 

181
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,550

boom so if you're too far away and

182
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,560
boom so if you're too far away and
 

183
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,469
boom so if you're too far away and
there's none of that it's not going to

184
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479

 

185
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,510

work into your arm then my arm takes

186
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
work into your arm then my arm takes
 

187
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,150
work into your arm then my arm takes
over my upper arm don't use your grip to

188
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
over my upper arm don't use your grip to
 

189
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,150
over my upper arm don't use your grip to
control his

190
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,160

 

191
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,390

body just like I'm here I use his grip

192
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,400
body just like I'm here I use his grip
 

193
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,590
body just like I'm here I use his grip
to bring his head into contact with the

194
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:46,600
to bring his head into contact with the
 

195
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,909
to bring his head into contact with the
arm and now I'm not using the grips I

196
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
arm and now I'm not using the grips I
 

197
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,110
arm and now I'm not using the grips I
changed my adhesion point so if he lets

198
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
changed my adhesion point so if he lets
 

199
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,550
changed my adhesion point so if he lets
go it doesn't

200
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
go it doesn't
 

201
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,710
go it doesn't
matter do you understand it's no

202
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
matter do you understand it's no
 

203
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,029
matter do you understand it's no
different than if for fighting

204
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
different than if for fighting
 

205
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,710
different than if for fighting
sideways right and I'm here I'm going to

206
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
sideways right and I'm here I'm going to
 

207
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,550
sideways right and I'm here I'm going to
check right and come in I'm bypassing

208
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
check right and come in I'm bypassing
 

209
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,790
check right and come in I'm bypassing
the wrist to attack the head I'm not

210
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
the wrist to attack the head I'm not
 

211
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,710
the wrist to attack the head I'm not
going to keep holding this and do that I

212
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
going to keep holding this and do that I
 

213
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,350
going to keep holding this and do that I
bypass oh and I'm

214
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360

 

215
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,950

in so use the grip to get to this

216
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:25,960
in so use the grip to get to this
 

217
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,390
in so use the grip to get to this
adhesion point then the grips are not

218
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
adhesion point then the grips are not
 

219
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,150
adhesion point then the grips are not
important

220
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,160
important
 

221
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,270
important
so same thing

222
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
so same thing
 

223
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,029
so same thing
here that's it the grip is now not

224
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:36,039
here that's it the grip is now not
 

225
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:42,950
here that's it the grip is now not
important I'm using this adhesion

226
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960

 

227
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:54,390

Point

228
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400

 

229
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,830

Bo do not Bend him backwards no no no

230
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:58,840
Bo do not Bend him backwards no no no
 

231
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,950
Bo do not Bend him backwards no no no
that means you have you have to let him

232
00:06:59,950 --> 00:06:59,960
that means you have you have to let him
 

233
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,909
that means you have you have to let him
come forward first he has to go

234
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
come forward first he has to go
 

235
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,510
come forward first he has to go
forward then

236
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,520

 

237
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,029

around not here you're coming

238
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039

 

239
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,909

in contact ignore the grip adhesion on

240
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
in contact ignore the grip adhesion on
 

241
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,469
in contact ignore the grip adhesion on
the upper

242
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:17,479
the upper
 

243
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,029
the upper
arm okay leave out the base displacement

244
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,039
arm okay leave out the base displacement
 

245
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,390
arm okay leave out the base displacement
so we just work on that go all right so

246
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
so we just work on that go all right so
 

247
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,909
so we just work on that go all right so
that that's what I'm doing and if I if I

248
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
that that's what I'm doing and if I if I
 

249
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,070
that that's what I'm doing and if I if I
do it

250
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
do it
 

251
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,950
do it
right then you're going to see that

252
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
right then you're going to see that
 

253
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,909
right then you're going to see that
before my arm goes that way he's already

254
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:36,919
before my arm goes that way he's already
 

255
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,189
before my arm goes that way he's already
going that

256
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
going that
 

257
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,189
going that
way you

258
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:42,199
way you
 

259
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,110
way you
see it's not that I'm here and I go and

260
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,120
see it's not that I'm here and I go and
 

261
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,110
see it's not that I'm here and I go and
then I push

262
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120

 

263
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,790

him same thing here it's not that I'm

264
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
him same thing here it's not that I'm
 

265
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,029
him same thing here it's not that I'm
here and I throw him and I accelerate

266
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,039
here and I throw him and I accelerate
 

267
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,070
here and I throw him and I accelerate
him backwards he's already once I get

268
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,080
him backwards he's already once I get
 

269
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,149
him backwards he's already once I get
that adhesion Point again the grips are

270
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:01,159
that adhesion Point again the grips are
 

271
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,790
that adhesion Point again the grips are
now irrelevant so we can show let's go

272
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:03,800
now irrelevant so we can show let's go
 

273
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,070
now irrelevant so we can show let's go
when I do the turn he's already going

274
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
when I do the turn he's already going
 

275
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,029
when I do the turn he's already going
that way you see that got it okay

276
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,039
that way you see that got it okay
 

277
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:28,230
that way you see that got it okay
so

278
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240

 

279
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:40,870

boom

280
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880

 

281
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,029

you should I want you to stop

282
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
you should I want you to stop
 

283
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,190
you should I want you to stop
here don't go past your shoulder and he

284
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
here don't go past your shoulder and he
 

285
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,230
here don't go past your shoulder and he
should be going backwards okay

286
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,240
should be going backwards okay
 

287
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,750
should be going backwards okay
try so that's what I'm doing with my IID

288
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:52,760
try so that's what I'm doing with my IID
 

289
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,070
try so that's what I'm doing with my IID
heian okay uh but there is a pattern

290
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
heian okay uh but there is a pattern
 

291
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,750
heian okay uh but there is a pattern
that that you're make it there is a

boom okay or I want to hit him under the

304
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:15,079
boom okay or I want to hit him under the
 

305
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,430
boom okay or I want to hit him under the
chin it's the pattern that I'm using

306
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,440
chin it's the pattern that I'm using
 

307
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,230
chin it's the pattern that I'm using
okay so pay attention it's not a

308
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
okay so pay attention it's not a

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,910
okay so pay attention it's not a
free-for-all we're doing G do so my palm

310
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
free-for-all we're doing G do so my palm
 

311
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,269
free-for-all we're doing G do so my palm
is going to go up as I'm doing the out

312
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
is going to go up as I'm doing the out
 

313
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,190
is going to go up as I'm doing the out
what's going to be the outward spiral

314
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
what's going to be the outward spiral
 

315
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,990
what's going to be the outward spiral
it's going to be the outward

316
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
it's going to be the outward
 

317
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,670
it's going to be the outward
spiral this

318
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
spiral this
 

319
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,350
spiral this
one but because I turn it doesn't look

320
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
one but because I turn it doesn't look
 

321
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,069
one but because I turn it doesn't look
like the outward spiral because I'm

322
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:39,079
like the outward spiral because I'm
 

323
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,470
like the outward spiral because I'm
turning on the inside of that movement

324
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,480
turning on the inside of that movement
 

325
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,870
turning on the inside of that movement
okay so this Palm is going to

326
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:43,880
okay so this Palm is going to
 

327
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,350
okay so this Palm is going to
go there is that upward block that I

328
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
go there is that upward block that I
 

329
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,269
go there is that upward block that I
just showed you and because I'm going to

330
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,279
just showed you and because I'm going to
 

331
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,350
just showed you and because I'm going to
enter again and turn again that's where

332
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
enter again and turn again that's where
 

333
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,470
enter again and turn again that's where
the Palm up comes

334
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,480
the Palm up comes
 

335
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,550
the Palm up comes
from by entering to the other side of

336

this hand
 

339
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,670
this hand
because I'm going to attack his base

340
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680

 

341
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,470

rotating don't go turn the camera don't

346
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:15,560
rotating don't go turn the camera don't
 

347
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,630
rotating don't go turn the camera don't
go

348
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
go
 

349
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,269
go
here keep rotating into it upward block

350
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
here keep rotating into it upward block
 

351
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,110
here keep rotating into it upward block
now don't go

352
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
now don't go
 

353
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,670
now don't go
here keep rotating that hand

354
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680

 

355
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,790

get on into the

356
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
get on into the
 

357
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,190
get on into the
upward step to the other side of it and

358
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,200
upward step to the other side of it and
 

359
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,590
upward step to the other side of it and
it'll end up Palm

360
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600

 

361
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,629

up so I don't want to go Palm up Palm up

362
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:49,639
up so I don't want to go Palm up Palm up
 

363
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,790
up so I don't want to go Palm up Palm up
Palm up there's no rotation in that arm

364
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,800
Palm up there's no rotation in that arm
 

365
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,590
Palm up there's no rotation in that arm
do you see that and you end up with it

366
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,600
do you see that and you end up with it
 

367
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,030
do you see that and you end up with it
cosmetically Palm up Palm up Palm up

368
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
cosmetically Palm up Palm up Palm up
 

369
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,910
cosmetically Palm up Palm up Palm up
Palm up up all your Delta

370
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920

 

371
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,310

rotate the

372
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
rotate the
 

373
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,790
rotate the
hand and because I'm moving in circles

374
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
hand and because I'm moving in circles
 

375
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,750
hand and because I'm moving in circles
in relation to that spiral that's how

376
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:10,760
in relation to that spiral that's how
 

377
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,110
in relation to that spiral that's how
the hand looks like what you're seeing

378
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
the hand looks like what you're seeing
 

379
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,670
the hand looks like what you're seeing
okay W here it is pop that's where that

380
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
okay W here it is pop that's where that
 

381
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,710
okay W here it is pop that's where that
is and now I move to the other side of

382
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
is and now I move to the other side of
 

383
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,790
is and now I move to the other side of
my

384
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800

 

385
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,949

hand and it'll be Palm

386
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
hand and it'll be Palm
 

387
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:47,430
hand and it'll be Palm
up

388
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440

 

389
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,030

okay let us get the hand pattern the

390
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
okay let us get the hand pattern the
 

391
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,230
okay let us get the hand pattern the
hand pattern okay okay so that is my

392
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
hand pattern okay okay so that is my
 

393
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,230
hand pattern okay okay so that is my
pattern that is the kazushi right there

394
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
pattern that is the kazushi right there
 

395
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,030
pattern that is the kazushi right there
and all all I

396
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,040
and all all I
 

397
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,750
and all all I
needed was that you see that's all you

398
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:04,760
needed was that you see that's all you
 

399
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,150
needed was that you see that's all you
need even stop that'll be enough but

400
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
need even stop that'll be enough but
 

401
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,629
need even stop that'll be enough but
remember the inertia is having him go

402
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
remember the inertia is having him go
 

403
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,069
remember the inertia is having him go
this way you

404
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:13,079
this way you
 

405
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,470
this way you
remember that little tilt is all I need

406
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
remember that little tilt is all I need
 

407
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,069
remember that little tilt is all I need
that is kazushi and here's where I would

408
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079
that is kazushi and here's where I would
 

409
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,870
that is kazushi and here's where I would
come in and displace his base very much

410
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:21,880
come in and displace his base very much
 

411
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,790
come in and displace his base very much
like

412
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
like
 

413
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,230
like
aatos so his base is weak and that's

414
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
aatos so his base is weak and that's
 

415
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,870
aatos so his base is weak and that's
where I displace his

416
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
where I displace his
 

417
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,670
where I displace his
base and that will help him go into that

418
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
base and that will help him go into that
 

419
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,829
base and that will help him go into that
kazushi Yang you see it makes his head

420
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
kazushi Yang you see it makes his head
 

421
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,310
kazushi Yang you see it makes his head
go that way okay so that's all I want I

422
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
go that way okay so that's all I want I
 

423
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,189
go that way okay so that's all I want I
want his body to be going the other

424
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:41,199
want his body to be going the other
 

425
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,470
want his body to be going the other
direction and now he's light and that's

426
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
direction and now he's light and that's
 

427
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,269
direction and now he's light and that's
where I can displace

428
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:46,279
where I can displace
 

429
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,710
where I can displace
base you understand different from I'm

430
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
base you understand different from I'm
 

431
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,310
base you understand different from I'm
here I shove them backwards and then I

432
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
here I shove them backwards and then I
 

433
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,829
here I shove them backwards and then I
accelerate here that's Yang on

434
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
accelerate here that's Yang on
 

435
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,430
accelerate here that's Yang on
yang I am instead creating Yin energy

436
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,440
yang I am instead creating Yin energy
 

437
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,629
yang I am instead creating Yin energy
going this

438
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639

then an i adhesion on him it's not

442
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,360
then an i adhesion on him it's not
 

443

shoving him
 

445
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,750
shoving him
down as his head goes into the kazushi

446
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
down as his head goes into the kazushi
 

447
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,269
down as his head goes into the kazushi
that you see

448
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,279
that you see
 

449
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,430
that you see
here my arm follows his head as it just

450
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,440
here my arm follows his head as it just
 

451
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,910
here my arm follows his head as it just
did that

452
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:26,920
did that
 

453
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,750
did that
patter until he falls off my arm you

454
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,760
patter until he falls off my arm you
 

455
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,790
patter until he falls off my arm you
understand it's not here and I'm the one

456
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:35,800
understand it's not here and I'm the one
 

457
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,269
understand it's not here and I'm the one
shoving him down yes my arm is touching

458
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
shoving him down yes my arm is touching
 

459
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,310
shoving him down yes my arm is touching
him but it's not what's pushing

460
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
him but it's not what's pushing
 

461
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,509
him but it's not what's pushing
him this energy had going

462
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:46,519
him this energy had going
 

463
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,310
him this energy had going
backwards and I stayed up with

464
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,320

 

465
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,749

it that and I stay up with
