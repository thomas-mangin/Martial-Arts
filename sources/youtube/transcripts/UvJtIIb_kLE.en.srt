00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,390
okay uh this one is very subtle but it
is there okay so you do the initial Yang

yes I'm do you feel the fatigue setting

298
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:24,839
yes I'm do you feel the fatigue setting
 

299
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,750
yes I'm do you feel the fatigue setting
do you see so we stay here forever I'm

300
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
do you see so we stay here forever I'm
 

301
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,350
do you see so we stay here forever I'm
going to be here for forever so I just

302
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
going to be here for forever so I just
 

303
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,829
going to be here for forever so I just
have the I adhesion but you're basically

304
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
have the I adhesion but you're basically
 

305
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,630
have the I adhesion but you're basically
doing deltoid bicep and you see that

306
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
doing deltoid bicep and you see that
 

307
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,150
doing deltoid bicep and you see that
you're going into a fatigue State see

308
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
you're going into a fatigue State see
 

309
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,430
you're going into a fatigue State see
that you're going to get burnt out

310
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:46,440
that you're going to get burnt out
 

311
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,069
that you're going to get burnt out
pretty soon do you

312
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:50,079

 

313
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,550

see you see yes I'm there there he is

314
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
see you see yes I'm there there he is
 

315
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,670
see you see yes I'm there there he is
okay whereas if we do it the other way

no what happened is this hand moved
 

507
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,509
no what happened is this hand moved
towards her and her Center didn't move

508
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:12,519
towards her and her Center didn't move
 

509
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,670
towards her and her Center didn't move
okay do you see that which means you're

510
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:14,680
okay do you see that which means you're
 

511
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,389
okay do you see that which means you're
external you're not in her Center do you

512
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
external you're not in her Center do you
 

513
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,670
external you're not in her Center do you
see that flip floppy yes

514
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:18,680
see that flip floppy yes
 

515
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,910
see that flip floppy yes
okay we just do this so you see this

516
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
okay we just do this so you see this
 

517
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,230
okay we just do this so you see this
this part you see

518
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,240
this part you see
 

519
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,949
this part you see
that

520
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
that
 

521
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,110
that
so this

522
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
so this
 

523
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,189
so this
has

524
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:30,199
has

elbow you're going to take away all
 

601
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,510
elbow you're going to take away all
mechanical advantage if you pay

602
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
mechanical advantage if you pay
 

603
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,190

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,280
instead of leaving this
 

607
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,909
instead of leaving this
up the kind

608
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:56,919
up the kind
 

609
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,510
up the kind
of just flip

610
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
of just flip
 

611
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,510
of just flip
so

612
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
so
 

613
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,549
so
flip

617
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,870

here this angle should be more

618
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
here this angle should be more
 

619
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,740
here this angle should be more
impossible you see but no it's in your

combined and integrate the external I
 

639
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,350
combined and integrate the external I
put you at a more mechanical
