174
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,280
about that but basically my the students
 

175
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,930
about that but basically my the students
who were high ranks by this time

176
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:23,940
who were high ranks by this time
 

177
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,090
who were high ranks by this time
in 2007

178
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,100
in 2007
 

179
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,010
in 2007
there was a group of them that I liked

180
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,020
there was a group of them that I liked
 

181
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,530
there was a group of them that I liked
as friends so I thought I'd joined them

182
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,540
as friends so I thought I'd joined them
 

183
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,689
as friends so I thought I'd joined them
so I joined them

184
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:32,699
so I joined them
 

185
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,330
so I joined them
um I could award the ikikai ranks but

186
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,340
um I could award the ikikai ranks but
 

187
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,550
um I could award the ikikai ranks but
they would go through the organization

188
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,560
they would go through the organization
 

189
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,430
they would go through the organization
and so I got the best of both worlds

190
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440

 

191
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,570

I gave them my word that I would

192
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
I gave them my word that I would
 

193
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,510
I gave them my word that I would
try and convert as many UK certified

194
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,520
try and convert as many UK certified
 

195
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,150
try and convert as many UK certified
teachers

196
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,160
teachers
 

197
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,050
teachers
students teachers who had who had UK

198
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,060
students teachers who had who had UK
 

199
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,050
students teachers who had who had UK
certification to ikikai some could

200
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,060
certification to ikikai some could
 

201
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,770
certification to ikikai some could
afford it some couldn't

202
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:03,780

 

203
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,330

so those who could we did and it still

204
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
so those who could we did and it still
 

205
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,110
so those who could we did and it still
left a majority who couldn't

206
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,120
left a majority who couldn't
 

207
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,350
left a majority who couldn't
so for since

208
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,360
so for since
 

209
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,490
so for since
2007 to 2022

210
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500

 

211
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,850

this problem has plagued me

212
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:22,860
this problem has plagued me
 

213
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,749
