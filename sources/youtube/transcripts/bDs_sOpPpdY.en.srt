all right
 

15
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,210
all right
so I'm safe so so you just need to just

16
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,220
so I'm safe so so you just need to just
 

17
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,090
so I'm safe so so you just need to just
a few times you know with with each and

18
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
a few times you know with with each and
 

19
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,670
a few times you know with with each and
why I've put you in threes is because

20
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
why I've put you in threes is because
 

21
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,890
why I've put you in threes is because
each person attacks different each

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,109
each person attacks different each
person's body weight is different you're

24
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,119
person's body weight is different you're
 

25
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,049
person's body weight is different you're
going to have to over the period today

26
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:33,059
going to have to over the period today
 

27
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,030
going to have to over the period today
you're gonna have to calculate what

28
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
you're gonna have to calculate what
 

29
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,310
you're gonna have to calculate what
you're dealing with and just being a

30
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
you're dealing with and just being a
 

31
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,990
you're dealing with and just being a
robot of doing the same thing every time

32
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
robot of doing the same thing every time
 

33
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,990
robot of doing the same thing every time
I oh I'm okay here look I'm miles away

34
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
I oh I'm okay here look I'm miles away
 

35
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,170
I oh I'm okay here look I'm miles away
you know he might extend the next person

36
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,180
you know he might extend the next person
 

37
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,990
you know he might extend the next person
might extend more extend more you know

38
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
might extend more extend more you know
 

39
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,610
might extend more extend more you know
that means that

40
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
that means that
 

41
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,990
that means that
all right so for the seniors you should

42
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
all right so for the seniors you should
 

43
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,490
all right so for the seniors you should
be able to sort of work that out that

44
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:55,500
be able to sort of work that out that
 

45
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,049
be able to sort of work that out that
you don't need to

46
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
you don't need to
 

47
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,750
you don't need to
do that but I I think for everybody if

48
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
do that but I I think for everybody if
 

49
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,930
do that but I I think for everybody if
you just for now just do that

50
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:02,940
you just for now just do that
 

51
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,490
you just for now just do that
they cut your hand comes up

52
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
they cut your hand comes up
 

53
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,770
they cut your hand comes up
in reality your hand wouldn't come up

54
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:09,780
in reality your hand wouldn't come up
 

55
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,510
in reality your hand wouldn't come up
but what we're doing here is we're

56
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
but what we're doing here is we're
 

57
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,690
but what we're doing here is we're
getting our timing

58
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:14,700

 

59
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,370

we're getting that we're getting a

60
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:16,380
we're getting that we're getting a
 

61
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,270
we're getting that we're getting a
timing going

62
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,280

 

63
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,010

it's as if

64
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,020
it's as if
 

65
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,550
it's as if
his Ken and my finger

66
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
his Ken and my finger
 

67
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,370
his Ken and my finger
has a piece of string to tied to it

68
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380

 

69
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,170

okay

70
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,180
okay
 

71
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,690
okay
it comes from the partner practice

72
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:38,700

 

73
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,170

yeah all right just just do that so this

74
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
yeah all right just just do that so this
 

75
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,670
yeah all right just just do that so this
person will cut

76
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
person will cut
 

77
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,190
person will cut
reasonably slow at first the higher the

78
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
reasonably slow at first the higher the
 

79
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,429
reasonably slow at first the higher the
rank faster that you the cut should be

80
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
rank faster that you the cut should be
 

81
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,149
rank faster that you the cut should be
eight

82
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159

 

83
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,100

I think

84
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,110
I think
 

85
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,830
I think
[Music]

86
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:56,840
[Music]
 

87
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,630
[Music]
hi okay

88
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
hi okay
 

89
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,870
hi okay
so the higher the rank the faster you

90
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
so the higher the rank the faster you
 

91
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,749
so the higher the rank the faster you
should be cutting

92
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759

 

93
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,309

okay so I just want to show you here

94
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
okay so I just want to show you here
 

95
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,309
okay so I just want to show you here
we've got two high level people

96
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319

 

97
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,290

they should be really cutting like fast

98
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:18,300
they should be really cutting like fast
 

99
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,750
they should be really cutting like fast
at their level

100
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760

 

101
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,630

but what the problem is and around this

102
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
but what the problem is and around this
 

103
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,610
but what the problem is and around this
way no that's it cool this way okay what

104
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:31,620
way no that's it cool this way okay what
 

105
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,990
way no that's it cool this way okay what
the problem is

106
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000

 

107
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,630

okay so I just want to explain what the

108
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:41,640
okay so I just want to explain what the
 

109
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,809
okay so I just want to explain what the
problem is look sensor used when they

110
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:44,819
problem is look sensor used when they
 

111
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,330
problem is look sensor used when they
are since the how do you teach he said I

112
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
are since the how do you teach he said I
 

113
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,410

start saying you know you lean this way

124
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:01,379
start saying you know you lean this way
 

125
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,410
start saying you know you lean this way
for the beginners and more what you know

126
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:03,420
for the beginners and more what you know
 

127
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,330
for the beginners and more what you know
it's it's we're going to build all day

128
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,340
it's it's we're going to build all day
 

129
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,309
it's it's we're going to build all day
talking really about things that aren't

130

talking really about things that aren't
 

131
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,930
talking really about things that aren't
important

important
 

133
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,570
important
but this is what the problem is all

134
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:11,580
but this is what the problem is all
 

135
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,350
but this is what the problem is all
right and we all do it I'm in line

136
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
right and we all do it I'm in line
 

137
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,110
right and we all do it I'm in line
I'm in line with my attacker

138
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm in line with my attacker
 

139
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,570
I'm in line with my attacker
hey I come here and then what you've

140
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:20,580
hey I come here and then what you've
 

141
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,790
hey I come here and then what you've
done was this

142
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
done was this
 

143
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,890
done was this
am I in line with the attacker no now

144
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:24,900
am I in line with the attacker no now
 

145
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,110
am I in line with the attacker no now
I've gone smaller and I've actually gone

146
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
I've gone smaller and I've actually gone
 

147
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,690
I've gone smaller and I've actually gone
off the line

148
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,700
off the line
 

149
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,350
off the line
without knowing it I've already gone in

150
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
without knowing it I've already gone in
 

151
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,290
without knowing it I've already gone in
self-defense mode but what about the guy

152
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:36,300
self-defense mode but what about the guy
 

153
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,470
self-defense mode but what about the guy
now starts actually cut in where he's

154
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,480
now starts actually cut in where he's
 

155
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,170
now starts actually cut in where he's
twigged that I've gone

156
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,180
twigged that I've gone
 

157
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,530
twigged that I've gone
hey that then starts bouncing me out

158
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:45,540
hey that then starts bouncing me out
 

159
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,869
hey that then starts bouncing me out
because I wasn't ready for him to come

160
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:47,879
because I wasn't ready for him to come
 

161
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,690
because I wasn't ready for him to come
over a few centimeters

162
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,700
over a few centimeters
 

163
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,690
over a few centimeters
so the push the one thing about Scentsy

164
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:53,700
so the push the one thing about Scentsy
 

165
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,470
so the push the one thing about Scentsy
was

166
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
was
 

167
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,990
was
he was a stickler for being precise and

168
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
he was a stickler for being precise and
 

169
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,449
he was a stickler for being precise and

00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
this one goes underneath now
 

225
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,030

if we're in a car

230
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
if we're in a car
 

231
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,810
if we're in a car
and I decide to change gears it might be

232
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:26,820
and I decide to change gears it might be
 

233
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,029
and I decide to change gears it might be
a different speed than perhaps somebody

234
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
a different speed than perhaps somebody
 

235
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,430
a different speed than perhaps somebody
else driving the car so I might like to

236
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
else driving the car so I might like to
 

237
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,670
else driving the car so I might like to
change gear every 3000 revs

238
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,680
change gear every 3000 revs
 

239
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,469
change gear every 3000 revs
how you might like to change it two and

240
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
how you might like to change it two and
 

241
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,930
how you might like to change it two and
a half thousand reps so what I have to

242
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:38,940
a half thousand reps so what I have to
 

243
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,230
a half thousand reps so what I have to
do is first I I marry his timing let's

244
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
do is first I I marry his timing let's
 

245
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,629
do is first I I marry his timing let's
do it real slow at this slow up and down

246
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
do it real slow at this slow up and down
 

247
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,810
do it real slow at this slow up and down
here I'm up same speed

248
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:47,820
here I'm up same speed
 

249
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,090
here I'm up same speed
then I have to quickly accelerate

250
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,100
then I have to quickly accelerate
 

251
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,570
then I have to quickly accelerate
because I need to be then ahead of him

252
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:53,580
because I need to be then ahead of him
 

253
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,230
because I need to be then ahead of him
if I'm here and then

254
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
if I'm here and then
 

255
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,070
if I'm here and then
if I can't get there now get in there

256
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
if I can't get there now get in there
 

257
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,310
if I can't get there now get in there
by the time he reaches the bottom

258
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,320

 

259
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,010

so it's no good game

260
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,020
so it's no good game
 

261
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,930
so it's no good game
I can't do the technique I want to show

262
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:11,940
I can't do the technique I want to show
 

263
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,570

you I can do what I've done and lost the

264
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,580
you I can do what I've done and lost the
 

265
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,570

okay
 

269
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,249
okay
but the one we're going to do is very

270
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:25,259
but the one we're going to do is very
 

271
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,490
but the one we're going to do is very
slowly up now I have to accelerate so

272
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:28,500
slowly up now I have to accelerate so
 

273
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,170
slowly up now I have to accelerate so
I'm there

274
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,180

 

275
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,629

I'll talk about this more in a minute

276
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
I'll talk about this more in a minute
 

277
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,230
I'll talk about this more in a minute
at this point in a minute

278
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,240

 

279
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,390

so I have to accelerate from the top to

280
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
so I have to accelerate from the top to
 

281
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,090
so I have to accelerate from the top to
the bottom

282
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,100
the bottom
 

283
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,749
the bottom
and you punch from here

284
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
and you punch from here
 

285
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,090
and you punch from here
okay on a gas mask

286
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,100

 

287
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,129

the detail we're going to come in closer

288
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:58,139
the detail we're going to come in closer
 

289
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,890
the detail we're going to come in closer
with the camera for the detail

290
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:00,900
with the camera for the detail
 

291
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,650
with the camera for the detail
what happens is at the bottom of the

292
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:03,660

391
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,509
