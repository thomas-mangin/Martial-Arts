00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,259

the weeks we've done the linear movement

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:14,269
the weeks we've done the linear movement
 

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,279
the weeks we've done the linear movement
you had some basic concepts which is the

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:19,289
you had some basic concepts which is the
 

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,140
you had some basic concepts which is the
ankle angle the knee vector and the knee

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,150
ankle angle the knee vector and the knee
 

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,009
ankle angle the knee vector and the knee
penetration guys remember that okay so

8
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
penetration guys remember that okay so
 

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,099
penetration guys remember that okay so
your needs that your knee doesn't go out

10
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:31,109
your needs that your knee doesn't go out
 

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,450
your needs that your knee doesn't go out
of alignment with your foot right and

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,460
of alignment with your foot right and
 

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,150
of alignment with your foot right and
all things being equal you weighted

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
all things being equal you weighted
 

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,260
all things being equal you weighted
mid-foot balance which is it the middle

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,270
mid-foot balance which is it the middle
 

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,990
mid-foot balance which is it the middle
of your play and we just call it that

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,000
of your play and we just call it that
 

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,619
of your play and we just call it that
right

20
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:45,629
right
 

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,410
right
it's that area about an inch strip

22
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,420
it's that area about an inch strip
 

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,939
it's that area about an inch strip
behind the ball of your foot and before

24
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:55,949
behind the ball of your foot and before
 

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,869
behind the ball of your foot and before
the arch starts you guys hit that it's a

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:00:59,879
the arch starts you guys hit that it's a
 

27
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:08,750
the arch starts you guys hit that it's a
line so when you came in your arch then

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:08,760
line so when you came in your arch then
 

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,210
line so when you came in your arch then
you're violating the knee vector right

30
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:13,220

 

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,609

when you turn your feet out your weight

32
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,619
when you turn your feet out your weight
 

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,539
when you turn your feet out your weight
is too much towards the heels of that

34
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:19,549
is too much towards the heels of that
 

35
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,219
is too much towards the heels of that
mid foot right and when I pushed my knee

36
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:25,229
mid foot right and when I pushed my knee
 

37
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,600
mid foot right and when I pushed my knee
past my toes I violate the principles on

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,610
past my toes I violate the principles on
 

39
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,679
past my toes I violate the principles on
the back foot or in combination when I

40
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:33,689
the back foot or in combination when I
 

41
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,620
the back foot or in combination when I
let that

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:34,630
let that
 

43
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,709
let that
that March come off the you now you

44
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:37,719
that March come off the you now you
 

45
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,090
that March come off the you now you
don't have your ground connection nor

46
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,100
don't have your ground connection nor
 

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,080
don't have your ground connection nor
your structural integrity so you're

48
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,090
your structural integrity so you're
 

49
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,749
your structural integrity so you're
probably not using cook you you're

50
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:48,759
probably not using cook you you're
 

51
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,270
probably not using cook you you're
probably using external forces like

52
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
probably using external forces like
 

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,559
probably using external forces like
bracing angles and strength okay so that

54
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:58,569
bracing angles and strength okay so that
 

55
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,569
bracing angles and strength okay so that
was like a year ago that video now we

56
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:00,579
was like a year ago that video now we
 

57
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,660
was like a year ago that video now we
have we're gonna go into the tournament

58
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:03,670
have we're gonna go into the tournament
 

59
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,240
have we're gonna go into the tournament
but it doesn't change any of the

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,250
but it doesn't change any of the
 

61
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,930
but it doesn't change any of the
principles okay so I still have to have

62
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:09,940
principles okay so I still have to have
 

63
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,370
principles okay so I still have to have
my knee on the same vector as my foot is

64
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380
my knee on the same vector as my foot is
 

65
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,750
my knee on the same vector as my foot is
I still can't push out past my toes

66
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
I still can't push out past my toes
 

67
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,320
I still can't push out past my toes
right and I still have to try to have

68
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,330
right and I still have to try to have
 

69
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,990
right and I still have to try to have
mid foot weight right so if I was going

70
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
mid foot weight right so if I was going
 

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,110
mid foot weight right so if I was going
to do a you Miyoshi forward right I

72
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
to do a you Miyoshi forward right I
 

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,380
to do a you Miyoshi forward right I
would shift my weight I can come to the

74
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,390
would shift my weight I can come to the
 

75
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,630
would shift my weight I can come to the
toes that will give me the positive

76
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
toes that will give me the positive
 

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,539
toes that will give me the positive
angle on that knee so that it can now

78
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:41,549
angle on that knee so that it can now
 

79
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,500
angle on that knee so that it can now
push me forward so that I'm not going to

80
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,510
push me forward so that I'm not going to
 

81
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,420
push me forward so that I'm not going to
walk and get caught if any energy

82
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,430
walk and get caught if any energy
 

83
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,729
walk and get caught if any energy
stopping me or I'm trying to push a

84
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:53,739
stopping me or I'm trying to push a
 

85
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,849
stopping me or I'm trying to push a
greater energy it'll send me backwards I

86
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:56,859
greater energy it'll send me backwards I
 

87
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,680
greater energy it'll send me backwards I
will not be able to project down into

88
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,690
will not be able to project down into
 

89
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,190
will not be able to project down into
the ground

90
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
the ground
 

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,559
the ground
does everyone remember that lesson yeah

92
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:01,569
does everyone remember that lesson yeah
 

93
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,059
does everyone remember that lesson yeah
you don't raise your hand will

94
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:03,069
you don't raise your hand will
 

95
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,610
you don't raise your hand will
demonstrate it again okay because not

96
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:05,620
demonstrate it again okay because not
 

97
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,559
demonstrate it again okay because not
everyone is walking like that yet so the

98
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:10,569
everyone is walking like that yet so the
 

99
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,160
everyone is walking like that yet so the
byproduct of that process is that

100
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,170
byproduct of that process is that
 

101
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,759
byproduct of that process is that
there's no weight on this foot remember

102
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:17,769
there's no weight on this foot remember
 

103
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:19,100
there's no weight on this foot remember
that

104
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,110
that
 

105
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,500
that
so that's what we're going to combine

106
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,510
so that's what we're going to combine
 

107
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,670
so that's what we're going to combine
but in classic kids and young theory I'm

108
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
but in classic kids and young theory I'm
 

109
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,950
but in classic kids and young theory I'm
going to now do it for a circle that was

110
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:27,960
going to now do it for a circle that was
 

111
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,720
going to now do it for a circle that was
the line I'm gonna do it for a circle

112
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:29,730
the line I'm gonna do it for a circle
 

113
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,210
the line I'm gonna do it for a circle
just like in the other one there's

114
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
just like in the other one there's
 

115
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,800
just like in the other one there's
always a little league in and the young

116
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,810
always a little league in and the young
 

117
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,550
always a little league in and the young
that's gonna be a little longer to hit

118
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
that's gonna be a little longer to hit
 

119
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,880
that's gonna be a little longer to hit
so when I wanted to turn right I'm going

120
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:40,890
so when I wanted to turn right I'm going
 

121
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,210
so when I wanted to turn right I'm going
to put my foot at the angle that I want

122
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,220
to put my foot at the angle that I want
 

123
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,440
to put my foot at the angle that I want
to go at so I'm not doing that is now my

124
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,450
to go at so I'm not doing that is now my
 

125
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,860
to go at so I'm not doing that is now my
heart shaking so wherever I want to turn

126
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:51,870
heart shaking so wherever I want to turn
 

127
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,210
heart shaking so wherever I want to turn
right I can put my foot there but I can

128
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,220
right I can put my foot there but I can
 

129
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:06,920
right I can put my foot there but I can
also turn my foot with my hip so this is

130
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:06,930
also turn my foot with my hip so this is
 

131
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,100
also turn my foot with my hip so this is
going to be obviously home but you're

132
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,110
going to be obviously home but you're
 

133
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,230
going to be obviously home but you're
gonna want to do this not wrong but not

134
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,240
gonna want to do this not wrong but not
 

135
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,849
gonna want to do this not wrong but not
necessarily applicable every time so

136
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:19,859
necessarily applicable every time so
 

137
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,250
necessarily applicable every time so
we're here and the first drill is bring

138
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,260
we're here and the first drill is bring
 

139
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,460
we're here and the first drill is bring
your knee to your toes so they share

140
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,470
your knee to your toes so they share
 

141
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,760
your knee to your toes so they share
angle your ankle now has that positive

142
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:31,770
angle your ankle now has that positive
 

143
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,000
angle your ankle now has that positive
vector that you could push with that mid

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,010
vector that you could push with that mid
 

145
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,080
vector that you could push with that mid
foot push that way okay and all I'm

146
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,090
foot push that way okay and all I'm
 

147
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,170
foot push that way okay and all I'm
going to do is connect my foot and my

148
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,180
going to do is connect my foot and my
 

149
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,290
going to do is connect my foot and my
knee to my hip so that when my hip

150
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,300
knee to my hip so that when my hip
 

151
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,150
knee to my hip so that when my hip
rotates all of that rotates you see that

152
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
rotates all of that rotates you see that
 

153
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,760
rotates all of that rotates you see that
that's the girl here need to toes walk

154
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:55,770
that's the girl here need to toes walk
 

155
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,990
that's the girl here need to toes walk
all that out

156
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,000

 

157
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,090

what am i turning on I'm turning on that

158
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,100
what am i turning on I'm turning on that
 

159
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,730
what am i turning on I'm turning on that
niche way okay

160
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,740
niche way okay
 

161
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,090
niche way okay
you can picture like there's something

162
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,100
you can picture like there's something
 

163
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,340
you can picture like there's something
special under that and you want to bury

164
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,350
special under that and you want to bury
 

165
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,760
special under that and you want to bury
it into the ground boom wait on the

166
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:16,770
it into the ground boom wait on the
 

167
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,810
it into the ground boom wait on the
mid-foot and you drill down okay let's

168
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:20,820
mid-foot and you drill down okay let's
 

169
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,570
mid-foot and you drill down okay let's
try to so just as I'm going to move

170
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,580
try to so just as I'm going to move
 

171
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,460
try to so just as I'm going to move
forward so that I can push like that

172
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,470
forward so that I can push like that
 

173
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,940
forward so that I can push like that
that's the same mid-foot weight that I'm

174
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:34,950
that's the same mid-foot weight that I'm
 

175
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,240
that's the same mid-foot weight that I'm
using to drive into the ground got it

176
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,250
using to drive into the ground got it
 

177
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,960
using to drive into the ground got it
so I'm going to generate that

178
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:41,970
so I'm going to generate that
 

179
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,300
so I'm going to generate that
relationship put me tip right shoulder

180
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,310
relationship put me tip right shoulder
 

181
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,720
relationship put me tip right shoulder
elbow angle in this case and I use that

182
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:50,730
elbow angle in this case and I use that
 

183
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,610
elbow angle in this case and I use that
to time so when I go here you see what

184
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,620
to time so when I go here you see what
 

185
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,890
to time so when I go here you see what
happened like mice are Street so I

186
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:00,900
happened like mice are Street so I
 

187
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,810
happened like mice are Street so I
violate the rule the knee and footage so

188
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:05,820
violate the rule the knee and footage so
 

189
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,250
violate the rule the knee and footage so
roll

190
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,260

 

191
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,290

yeah okay now the same relationship of

192
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,300
yeah okay now the same relationship of
 

193
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,950
yeah okay now the same relationship of
walking we're organizing by an ankle

194
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
walking we're organizing by an ankle
 

195
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,500
walking we're organizing by an ankle
knee and hip use over here so do the

196
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,510
knee and hip use over here so do the
 

197
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,390
knee and hip use over here so do the
same drill it's not going to be a

198
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
same drill it's not going to be a
 

199
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,530
same drill it's not going to be a
freebie in this so as this hip rotates

200
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:30,540
freebie in this so as this hip rotates
 

201
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,020
freebie in this so as this hip rotates
around goes around you see how that get

202
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,030
around goes around you see how that get
 

203
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,490
around goes around you see how that get
cooking you can't have your hips do this

204
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
cooking you can't have your hips do this
 

205
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
cooking you can't have your hips do this
kind of work so if I lock or organize my

206
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,510
kind of work so if I lock or organize my
 

207
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,380
kind of work so if I lock or organize my
knee and foot to my elbow and shoulder

208
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,390
knee and foot to my elbow and shoulder
 

209
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,980
knee and foot to my elbow and shoulder
then as this foot rotates this hip

210
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:54,990
then as this foot rotates this hip
 

211
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,760
then as this foot rotates this hip
rotates forward this hip rotates back my

212
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:58,770
rotates forward this hip rotates back my
 

213
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,460
rotates forward this hip rotates back my
knee and foot will come back without me

214
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,470
knee and foot will come back without me
 

215
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,390
knee and foot will come back without me
stepping then okay so generate the

216
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,400
stepping then okay so generate the
 

217
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,150
stepping then okay so generate the
positive angle drill you see where my so

218
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,160
positive angle drill you see where my so
 

219
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,010
positive angle drill you see where my so
I don't have to go here and then see

220
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,020
I don't have to go here and then see
 

221
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,480
I don't have to go here and then see
that without nor do I go here and my

222
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,490
that without nor do I go here and my
 

223
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,790
that without nor do I go here and my
foot came across how did he go across

224
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
foot came across how did he go across
 

225
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,430
foot came across how did he go across

boom start to go like this

232
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,180

 

233
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,280

let's burn the head and the foot will go

234

let's burn the head and the foot will go
and you will end up in fund me you will

236
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,050
and you will end up in fund me you will
 

237
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,350
and you will end up in fund me you will
not end up on the tightrope by keel

drilling puck you're drilling up because

250
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:13,830
drilling puck you're drilling up because
 

251
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,640
drilling puck you're drilling up because
you actually didn't have this foot D

252
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:16,650
you actually didn't have this foot D
 

253
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,540
you actually didn't have this foot D
waited so the only way you're in a D

waited so the only way you're in a D
weight it is to push up then you can

256
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,330
weight it is to push up then you can
 

257
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,900
weight it is to push up then you can
move it on the ground it's not be

258
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:26,910
move it on the ground it's not be
 

259
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,030
move it on the ground it's not be
weighted because you didn't drive down

260
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,040
weighted because you didn't drive down
 

261
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,640
weighted because you didn't drive down
into this foot drive down and your

262
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,650
into this foot drive down and your
 

263
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,290
into this foot drive down and your
imagery and the sensation of your foot

264
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,300
imagery and the sensation of your foot
 

265
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,760
imagery and the sensation of your foot
should be and torquing pressing down the

266
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:43,770
should be and torquing pressing down the
 

267
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,990
should be and torquing pressing down the
exact opposite of this okay so here push

268
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
exact opposite of this okay so here push
 

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,180
exact opposite of this okay so here push
down boom take and put more weight on

270
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,190
down boom take and put more weight on
 

271
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,410
down boom take and put more weight on
here not less weight on here okay so

272
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
here not less weight on here okay so
 

273
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,190
here not less weight on here okay so
don't spring up second one you're like

274
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,200
don't spring up second one you're like
 

275
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,250
don't spring up second one you're like
two straight you see here your body's

276
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
two straight you see here your body's
 

277
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,960
two straight you see here your body's
like this okay

278
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:11,970
like this okay
 

279
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,930
like this okay
so if I push by knee so that I get the

280
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:17,940
so if I push by knee so that I get the
 

281
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,030
so if I push by knee so that I get the
mid foot weight and I sit up you see

282
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
mid foot weight and I sit up you see
 

283
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,829
mid foot weight and I sit up you see
that living back here arch pays it

284
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
that living back here arch pays it
 

285
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,990
that living back here arch pays it
so you're anatomically biomechanically

286
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,000
so you're anatomically biomechanically
 

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,210
so you're anatomically biomechanically
it's can't do it strategically this is

288
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,220
it's can't do it strategically this is
 

289
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,680
it's can't do it strategically this is
not a fighting posture okay you want to

290
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,690
not a fighting posture okay you want to
 

291
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,269
not a fighting posture okay you want to
engage that rear posterior chain are you

292
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
engage that rear posterior chain are you
 

293
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,460
engage that rear posterior chain are you
gonna have a camp and you don't want to

294
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,470
gonna have a camp and you don't want to
 

295
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,769
gonna have a camp and you don't want to
get your head knocked off so you're

296
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:49,779
get your head knocked off so you're
 

297
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,170
get your head knocked off so you're
gonna have a camp you see that you're

298
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,180
gonna have a camp you see that you're
 

299
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,920
gonna have a camp you see that you're
not gonna go care like this so if you're

300
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:55,930
not gonna go care like this so if you're
 

301
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,319
not gonna go care like this so if you're
trying to do this on your two straight

302
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:58,329
trying to do this on your two straight
 

303
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,000
trying to do this on your two straight
you've already set yourself up for

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,010
you've already set yourself up for
 

305
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,400
you've already set yourself up for
failure all right if I am happen to be

306
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,410
failure all right if I am happen to be
 

307
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,210
failure all right if I am happen to be
some people have like very frog-like or

308
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,220
some people have like very frog-like or
 

309
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,829
some people have like very frog-like or
points of articulation such that you can

310
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
points of articulation such that you can
 

311
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,310
points of articulation such that you can
keep that arch down right but it's not

312
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
keep that arch down right but it's not
 

313
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,009
keep that arch down right but it's not
pressurized it's too soft everywhere

314
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:23,019
pressurized it's too soft everywhere
 

315
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,110
pressurized it's too soft everywhere
right and secondly if you watch my good

316
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
right and secondly if you watch my good
 

317
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,110
right and secondly if you watch my good
here and now when I sit up what's

318
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
here and now when I sit up what's
 

319
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,400
here and now when I sit up what's
happening in terms of weight

320
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,410
happening in terms of weight
 

321
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,160
happening in terms of weight
distribution it's going that way and I

322
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,170
distribution it's going that way and I
 

323
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,590
distribution it's going that way and I
need to do weight that foot you see that

324
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
need to do weight that foot you see that
 

325
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,290
need to do weight that foot you see that
and so you will tend to do it a double

326
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:40,300
and so you will tend to do it a double
 

327
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,220
and so you will tend to do it a double
pivot you're going to turn in here maybe

328
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,230
pivot you're going to turn in here maybe
 

329
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,490
pivot you're going to turn in here maybe
between your feet you see that and the

330
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:47,500
between your feet you see that and the
 

331
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,280
between your feet you see that and the
other one is a single point pivot I'm

332
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,290
other one is a single point pivot I'm
 

333
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,879
other one is a single point pivot I'm
turning over my foot you see that so you

334
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:53,889
turning over my foot you see that so you
 

335
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,139
turning over my foot you see that so you
have to pay attention to that because

336
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:55,149
have to pay attention to that because
 

337
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,600
have to pay attention to that because
double pivots is when when people hit

338
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,610
double pivots is when when people hit
 

339
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,670
double pivots is when when people hit
you boom they knock you knock you off

340
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
you boom they knock you knock you off
 

341
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,949
you boom they knock you knock you off
the line because you're on a tightrope

342
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:01,959
the line because you're on a tightrope
 

343
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,340
the line because you're on a tightrope
so

344
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:05,350

 

345
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,519

put as much weight here and don't sit up

346
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:10,529
put as much weight here and don't sit up
 

347
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,319
put as much weight here and don't sit up
of course you might make the opposite

348
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:13,329
of course you might make the opposite
 

349
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,449
of course you might make the opposite
mistake but when you do that what

350
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:15,459
mistake but when you do that what
 

351
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,449
mistake but when you do that what
happened to my knee boy pass my toes so

352
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:18,459
happened to my knee boy pass my toes so
 

353
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,769
happened to my knee boy pass my toes so
you violated that rule okay good try I

354
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:22,779
you violated that rule okay good try I
 

355
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,670
you violated that rule okay good try I

this lesson if I don't get that positive

358
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,290
this lesson if I don't get that positive
 

359
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,259
this lesson if I don't get that positive
mid foot weight on there right and

360
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:33,269
mid foot weight on there right and
 

361
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,889
mid foot weight on there right and
basically I'm switching ground path from

362
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:37,899
basically I'm switching ground path from
 

363
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,120
basically I'm switching ground path from
one foot to the other

364
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,130
one foot to the other
 

365
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,600
one foot to the other
so right now mid foot weights on the

366
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,610
so right now mid foot weights on the
 

367
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,290
so right now mid foot weights on the
back foot so he's pushing and he's just

368
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
back foot so he's pushing and he's just
 

369
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,840
back foot so he's pushing and he's just
grinding that back foot down which is

370
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:48,850
grinding that back foot down which is
 

371
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,110
grinding that back foot down which is
different from this this is just using

372
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,120
different from this this is just using
 

373
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,540
different from this this is just using
friction and I'm using this bracing

374
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:54,550
friction and I'm using this bracing
 

375
00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:01,199
friction and I'm using this bracing
angle so we're here and he's pushing and

376
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:01,209
angle so we're here and he's pushing and
 

377
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,139
angle so we're here and he's pushing and
he's just grinding that down because

378
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:04,149
he's just grinding that down because
 

379
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,540
he's just grinding that down because
this is not a bracing angle don't let go

380
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,550
this is not a bracing angle don't let go
 

381
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,329
this is not a bracing angle don't let go
as you feel okay okay then that's how

and your line of gravity between your

482
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,060
and your line of gravity between your
 

483
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,090
and your line of gravity between your
feet you see that okay there you go like

484
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,100
feet you see that okay there you go like
 

485
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,120
feet you see that okay there you go like
this you're double pivoting and the

486
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,130
this you're double pivoting and the
 

487
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,579
this you're double pivoting and the
angle the vector or the line of gravity

488
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:43,589
angle the vector or the line of gravity
 

489
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,280
angle the vector or the line of gravity
is in between no she'll be over this

490
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,290
is in between no she'll be over this
 

491
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,120
is in between no she'll be over this
foot should be over this way then this

492
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,130
foot should be over this way then this
 

493
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,120
foot should be over this way then this
foot most straight back and then you

494
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,130
foot most straight back and then you
 

495
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,290
foot most straight back and then you
will you return to the new triangle of

496
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:56,300
will you return to the new triangle of
 

497
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,880
will you return to the new triangle of
your right angle being 90 degrees not

498
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:01,890
your right angle being 90 degrees not
 

499
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:08,090
your right angle being 90 degrees not
back not forward your knee is going or

500
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,100
back not forward your knee is going or
 

501
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,990
back not forward your knee is going or
your foot is going

502
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,000
your foot is going
 

503
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,710
your foot is going
so no if you want your knee there what

504
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
so no if you want your knee there what
 

505
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,820
so no if you want your knee there what
should you do with your foot turn it

506
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:15,830
should you do with your foot turn it
 

507
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,840
should you do with your foot turn it
okay and this brings us the linearity or

508
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:20,850
okay and this brings us the linearity or
 

509
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,079
okay and this brings us the linearity or
