here don't shove them back

2
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
here don't shove them back
 

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,270
here don't shove them back
reconcile this energy here

4
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280

 

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,390

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,110

that's that adhesion okay got it

20
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
that's that adhesion okay got it
 

21
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,710
that's that adhesion okay got it
you're not getting out of the way and

22
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
you're not getting out of the way and
 

23
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,630
you're not getting out of the way and
they come flying in and then you

24
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
they come flying in and then you
 

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,869
they come flying in and then you
accelerate them backwards

26
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
accelerate them backwards
 

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,630
accelerate them backwards
okay

28
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
okay
 

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:29,750
okay
luke is pulling

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:54,550

you don't need the head

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560

 

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,190

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:21,189

there's

40
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199

 

41

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,430

i go slow say that

44
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
i go slow say that
 

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,030
i go slow say that
you can tell that

46
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
you can tell that
 

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,189
you can tell that
you're pulling

48
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
you're pulling
 

49
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,690
you're pulling
you see but if you're just doing it

50
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:47,700
you see but if you're just doing it
 

51
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,150
you see but if you're just doing it
[Music]

52
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
[Music]
 

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,150
[Music]
no one can tell that he's pulling do you

54
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
no one can tell that he's pulling do you
 

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
no one can tell that he's pulling do you
see that

56
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
see that
 

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:05,909
see that
so

58
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919

 

59
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,510

that was you pulley

60
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
that was you pulley
 

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,550
that was you pulley
okay

62
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
okay
 

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,870
okay
so you gotta figure out

64
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
so you gotta figure out
 

65
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,710
so you gotta figure out
because it's not

66
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
because it's not
 

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,749
because it's not
me pulling you

68
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759

 

69
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,950

hey

70
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960

 

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,189

okay we'll go back to the spinal

72
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
okay we'll go back to the spinal
 

73
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,710
okay we'll go back to the spinal
displacement that he's trying to do okay

74
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
displacement that he's trying to do okay
 

75
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,230
displacement that he's trying to do okay
um so not not pulling anyone but

76
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
um so not not pulling anyone but
 

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,310
um so not not pulling anyone but
pulling and pushing is not

78
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
pulling and pushing is not
 

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,029
pulling and pushing is not
it's a false dichotomy okay

80
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
it's a false dichotomy okay
 

81
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,189
it's a false dichotomy okay
um

82
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
um
 

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,350
um
when you can internalize things all

84
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
when you can internalize things all
 

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,629
when you can internalize things all
right

86
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
right
 

87
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,550
right
so um

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
so um
 

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,270
so um
let us pay attention to

90
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
let us pay attention to
 

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,510
let us pay attention to
the yin yang cycles of the tesla okay

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
the yin yang cycles of the tesla okay
 

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,830
the yin yang cycles of the tesla okay
so what's going to happen is the arm is

94
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
so what's going to happen is the arm is
 

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,189
so what's going to happen is the arm is
going to pass from a yin phase

96
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
going to pass from a yin phase
 

97
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,309
going to pass from a yin phase
into a two hand

98
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
into a two hand
 

99
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,590
into a two hand
transition

100
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
transition
 

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,749
transition
and as that hand

102
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
and as that hand
 

103
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,590
and as that hand
exits its face the other hand enters its

104
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
exits its face the other hand enters its
 

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,110
exits its face the other hand enters its
face until

106
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
face until
 

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,909
face until
it enters into a new two-hand transition

108
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
it enters into a new two-hand transition
 

109
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,390
it enters into a new two-hand transition
and then they cycle through okay

110
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
and then they cycle through okay
 

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,270
and then they cycle through okay
so uh as it's coming through

112
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
so uh as it's coming through
 

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,430
so uh as it's coming through
there is a there's a moment here where

114
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
there is a there's a moment here where
 

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,070
there is a there's a moment here where
both hands are on on both hands i'll

116
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
both hands are on on both hands i'll
 

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,070
both hands are on on both hands i'll
exaggerate the length of the trend but

118
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
exaggerate the length of the trend but
 

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,230
exaggerate the length of the trend but
both hands are in your body right now

120
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
both hands are in your body right now
 

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,110
both hands are in your body right now
cassie so both hands are kind of doing

122
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
cassie so both hands are kind of doing
 

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,909
cassie so both hands are kind of doing
that okay

124
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919

 

125
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,629

what i tend to see you do is you go you

126
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
what i tend to see you do is you go you
 

127
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,350
what i tend to see you do is you go you
go one hand and dead

128
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
go one hand and dead
 

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,830
go one hand and dead
and then is dead and then the other hand

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
and then is dead and then the other hand
 

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,070
and then is dead and then the other hand
comes okay

132
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
comes okay
 

133
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,749
comes okay
that's going to make it very difficult

134
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
that's going to make it very difficult
 

135
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,430
that's going to make it very difficult
to get in someone's body with the

136
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
to get in someone's body with the
 

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,830
to get in someone's body with the
internal aspects okay because you you're

138
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
internal aspects okay because you you're
 

139
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,469
internal aspects okay because you you're
turning the floor on and off

140
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
turning the floor on and off
 

141
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,189
turning the floor on and off
so

142
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
so
 

143
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,950
so
on

144
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
on
 

145
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,870
on
it's starting to go off when it starts

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
it's starting to go off when it starts
 

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,749
it's starting to go off when it starts
to go off the other hand will be on with

148
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
to go off the other hand will be on with
 

149
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,189
to go off the other hand will be on with
it on

150
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
it on
 

151
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,550
it on
until this goes off you see and this

152
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
until this goes off you see and this
 

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,110
until this goes off you see and this
hand is on and now guess what

154
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
hand is on and now guess what
 

155
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,990
hand is on and now guess what
here's the other half and you'll see if

156
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
here's the other half and you'll see if
 

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,710
here's the other half and you'll see if
this hand keeps going eventually it goes

158
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
this hand keeps going eventually it goes
 

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,230
this hand keeps going eventually it goes
off

160
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
off
 

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,270
off
so

162
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
so
 

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,029
so
we're back a little

164
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
we're back a little
 

165
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,430
we're back a little
the two hands together are going when

166
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
the two hands together are going when
 

167
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,510
the two hands together are going when
you feel that hand go off this hand

168
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
you feel that hand go off this hand
 

169
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,150
you feel that hand go off this hand
becomes dominant now do you see

170
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
becomes dominant now do you see
 

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,469
becomes dominant now do you see
and it's the one that's bringing him

172
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
and it's the one that's bringing him
 

173
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,629
and it's the one that's bringing him
back you guys keep doing this hand and

174
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
back you guys keep doing this hand and
 

175
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,430
back you guys keep doing this hand and
this is off this hand will not go off

176
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
this is off this hand will not go off
 

177
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,309
this is off this hand will not go off
till about here where it's just

178
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
