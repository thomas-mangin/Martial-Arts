1
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,800
We just got up and took a shower.

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,633
We are about to go to the dojo.

3
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,733
We did not sleep very well so we are a bit tired

4
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:40,800
but we are going to give everything during training.

5
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,833
Sensei is 83 years old but he slept with us on the tatami last night

6
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,767
and he is in a far better shape than us!

7
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,700
See you later!

8
00:01:56,133 --> 00:02:00,367
Do it like this,

9
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:05,933
And then, go there.

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,367
From outside it looks like this,

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,867
if you manage to neutralize the thumb, then the arm is neutralized too.

12
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:26,900
This is where you go.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,067
That is the idea, and then you throw.

14
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:46,000
Hold with the hand, but don't grab yet...

15
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,233
Do it like this.

16
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:56,067
Put your thumb against his thumb

17
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,833
So that the elbow of the partner bends.

18
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:04,233
Then you bring him there.

19
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,400
Only then can you raise it up, and go there.

20
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:29,733
Usually we don't throw but let's work on ukemi for now.

21
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:36,533
Now let's talk about the Takumakai of Shikoku.

22
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:47,833
Aikibudo was the art of the Takeda warriors.

23
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,200
After that experience at the Daito-kan, we really got a lot of respect for Takeda Tokimune and it was mutual.

24
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,967
We really started to integrate the way of thinking of the Takeda at that time.

25
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:10,233
Yes, the evidence for this is that Shikoku is allowed to use the four diamonds, symbol of the Takeda,

26
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:22,833
it is a mark of trust on behalf of the Daito-kan and Mr Takeda toward the students of Shikoku.

27
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,167
This symbol is a mark of trust.

28
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:34,300
When we grab the opponent as he comes came to grab us, it becomes the techniques of the Sankajo series.

29
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:46,133
So this is the Hiji-kaeshi of Sankajo.

30
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,667
Everybody just did the Hiji-ka of Ikkajo, the one where you allow yourself to be grabbed.

31
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,767
In that one, you must mobilize the partner.

32
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:10,733
If the thumb comes here, you can surround it with yours like this.

33
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:21,700
You can bring him there and act on him.

34
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,033
The hips turn like this.

35
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:32,100
You can even drag him like this, see? He moved.

36
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:38,333
His center of gravity came on that leg.

37
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,367
This is why we go the other way.

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,533
When he moves, you can enter on him.

39
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:51,833
We will do it another way.

40
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,800
We just finished the morning class.

41
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,700
We are out to eat Udon,

42
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,433
hopefully nothing too heavy because we have another training session this afternoon.

43
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:21,667
Today we had a good go at it.

44
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,300
So we are looking forward to this afternoon and then we are heading back to Tokyo tonight.

45
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:44,567
It is the students of Nakatsu Sensei, particularly Chiba Sensei,

46
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:56,967
who decided to find an official name for these koryu gatherings of mutual exchange

47
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:17,733
between the students of Takuma Hisa Sensei and Nakatsu Heizaburo Sensei that took place at the Kansai Aikido Club.

48
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,033
Who proposed the name Takumakai?

49
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,467
Chiba Sensei did.

50
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,900
Many propositions were made to name this study group

51
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:35,667
but because they were studying under Takuma Sensei, Chiba Sensei proposed to use "Takumakai" [litt. gathering for Takuma].

52
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:56,300
These are organizational matters. The clerc wrote that it was decided in Osaka following my proposal

53
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:16,033
but in fact, it is that student of Nakatsu Sensei from Komashima who first came up with the idea.

54
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,233
We received a request from Osaka to find a name, so after discussing it among ourselves

55
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:31,067
we suggested this name.

56
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:41,867
It is not us who went there [to Osaka] to tell them what to do, but them who agreed to do as we suggested. That is how the name "Takumakai" was decided upon.

57
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:50,133
At that time, the techniques from Shikoku and Osaka were a bit different weren't they?

58
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,633
Totally different!

59
00:09:53,033 --> 00:10:13,633
This is why Hisa [Takuma] thought that the Daito-ryu from Shikoku should also be taught in Osaka,

60
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:25,100
When you mixed the techniques from Shikoku with the other ones, it was explosive!

61
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:37,500
Hisa Sensei said that it had to be done and he taught a few people the techniques from Shikoku.

62
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,867
So Takuma Hisa said to the people of Osaka: "wouldn't it be more interesting if we merged the two forms?"

63
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,833
I thought that it certainly would.

64
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,400
This is the handbook of the Takumakai.

65
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,733
What is this?

66
00:10:54,733 --> 00:11:01,167
These are the scrolls that belong to the Takumakai.

67
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:06,033
Because they want to show that they have them...

68
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:11,267
But originally, it is Tokimune Sensei who compiled these techniques isn't it?

69
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,333
This means that the techniques must be the same?

70
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,067
Yes, the same.

71
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:18,633
But even if the names match, the ways to do them is different?

72
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,767
Yes, different.

73
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:33,267
Because Hisa [Takuma] Sensei had received the Menkyo MinakaÃ¯ no Kaigi [certification of complete transmission and teaching license],

74
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:38,967
Where did Nakatsu Sensei formally study Daito-ryu?

75
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:48,133
At the Asahi journal under Ueshiba Morihei and Takeda Sokaku Sensei.

76
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,733
The one at the top of the Asahi staff pyramid was Hisa Takuma Sensei

77
00:11:54,833 --> 00:12:01,767
but the ones who trained most regularly were the ones below him.

78
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:13,767
Like the blade of a knife...

79
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,500
This is how you do it, that is why power comes there.

80
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,233
Then, on the specific point of Ippondori, you go straight, with the right leg at same time.

81
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:31,333
Then you go this way,

82
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,600
and then, place your hand like if it was mirror.

83
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:52,467
They used to take pictures straight after having seen them performed by Takeda Sokaku

84
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:58,733
so they were not meant as an instructional reference but rather as a memory help.

85
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:06,467
This means that from these pictures, there is a part that can be understood, and a part that cannot.

86
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:18,100
This is why I don't think that the techniques that we call "Shoden" were exactly like those that we can see on the Soden pictures.

87
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:25,300
Tokimune Sensei thought the same.

88
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:37,133
All the techniques until the Menkyo Kaiden were merely guidelines for practice.

89
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:45,600
It was a way to unite the knowledge of both "Ju" and "Jutsu".

90
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:51,033
I asked how long it would take to learn.

91
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,233
I was told that 20 years would not be enough.

92
00:13:56,533 --> 00:14:02,300
But I was sure that 20 years should be enough to learn the basics.

93
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:14,767
So I started to learn and copy all that, to dive into the techniques again and again.

94
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,433
This is where I realized that the way to do these techniques was different.

95
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:36,433
Regarding the grading system, how and why did we change from the Menkyo system to the Dan system?

96
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,933
There were three levels of knowledge, Shoden, Chuden, and Okuden, and the secret Hiden.

97
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:49,433
This was the core of the teaching at the time.

98
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,433
Technique started with that.

99
00:14:54,433 --> 00:15:00,933
But nowadays, even this is hard to understand so that is why we changed for Dan grades.

100
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,633
Was the Shoden equivalent to today's Nikajo?

101
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:13,933
Yes, the Shoden was roughly equivalent to nowadays' Shodan and Nidan.

102
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:19,800
So it is the level of Nikajo

103
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,367
What about Chuden?

104
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:34,767
Chuden was only equivalent to Sandan

105
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:43,033
Sensei, from what point do we start understanding anything about all that?

106
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:48,467
From Sandan to Godan, it is only Yonkajo

107
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,267
From Yonkajo...

108
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:55,267
It means that we also know the things that are written below there.

109
00:15:55,267 --> 00:16:00,033
This too is taken into account.

110
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,433
So if we know that, it is Chuden.

111
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:15,433
In today's Takumakai,

112
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,567
Ikkajo is Shodan,

113
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,067
Nikajo is Nidan,

114
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,533
Sankajo is Sandan,

115
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:32,433
but before, this list [the one at the back] did not exist,

116
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:38,200
so Ikkajo was just that.

117
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,467
Ikkajo, Nikajo, Sankajo, it was not so defined.

118
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,567
We did not know about that.

119
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:51,700
Only Daiichijo, Dainijo, etc. was written.

120
00:16:51,900 --> 00:17:00,633
From there to here, it was the beginning, almost exclusively seated techniques.

121
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:04,933
Now we call that Idori.

122
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:18,233
There used to be over a 100 techniques in Idori

123
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:24,400
Only for Idori.

124
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:34,533
And after learning that, we did the same ones standing.

125
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:42,433
We had to make the connection between what we had learned on our knees and that standing position.

126
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:46,400
This is how we learned.

127
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,933
We did that for Shoden, but also for Chuden.

128
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:56,033
So the Shoden syllabus was almost only practiced kneeling?

129
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:05,700
Yes, with some additional things such the "Kime" [joint locks] that we saw earlier on,

130
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,667
Without that, it wouldn't have been possible,

131
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:20,267
because on Idori, if someone pulls, you, you will collapse forward.

132
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:27,400
In Tachiai [standing techniques], it is different, you just have to move the foot forward to get your balance back.

133
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,433
That is it.

134
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:38,133
So there is all of what we learn in a general way, plus the Soden.

135
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:45,767
But what counts is the time spent and the way we do the techniques.

136
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:50,667
If we take the time to study, it will be reflected in the techniques.

137
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,767
So at the beginning, we learn 10 techniques

138
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,467
but at the 10th one, we forget them.

139
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:04,067
But even if we forget, there are at least 2 that we remember.

140
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:12,967
In 5 minutes you can learn 5 techniques... you can learn a technique in 2 or 3 minutes.

141
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,867
The other day someone told me: "It hurts", so I answered "That way you will remember!"

142
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:26,767
In general, between the beginning and the end of a class, we remember better the painful techniques.

143
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:35,533
This is why we should not shy away from the issue of pain in techniques like those of the Soden.

144
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,567
Otherwise we can't learn.

145
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,967
We can't learn the essential points of the movements.

146
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,100
And we can't have trust in the heart of the Daito-ryu techniques.

147
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:53,600
If we perform the techniques in a sloppy way, we can't get the essential roots of the techniques.

148
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,533
And this way, we can't understand Kaeshi either.

149
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:05,867
Regarding the techniques at the top [those in the top scroll], Soke used to say that because we did not understand,

150
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:18,800
we had to do that on Ikajo's katatedori and ryotedori, we had to let ourselves be grabbed like this.

151
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,667
This was a secret.

152
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,867
When the opponent comes and grabs like this...

153
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Not like that, like this, the hand stays free.

154
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:53,700
Do this...

155
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,533
From that point, there is an essential point to control.

156
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,000
If you do this, it is not practical at all.

157
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:11,700
However, if you put your finger like this... right there...

158
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:15,733
This is Gyaku-kote from the Nikajo series.

159
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:28,667
This is how it is done, like that, and if you pull a bit, you are back on the first movement [Ippondori].

160
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:34,500
This is the kind of things that must be understood but that most never get.

161
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,400
But essentially, this is what Aiki is about; this is what you should learn first.

162
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,333
Just do this,

163
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,933
and the opponent will fall on the ground.

164
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:51,367
These are the Nikajo projection techniques.

165
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:55,700
These are the bases that will lead to "Aiki-Nage"

166
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,733
If you don't do that, the techniques mean nothing.

167
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:11,867
One day, Hisa Sensei decided to check how deep my understanding of the technique was.

168
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:16,700
He wanted to test me.

169
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,900
He asked me to show him my Aiki-Nage

170
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:26,400
I don't preoccupy myself as to whether I have been grabbed or not

171
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,600
so I said: "Attack me", and when the attack came, I did that!

172
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,300
So the guy went flying like that.

173
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,133
Then I said: "Next one"

174
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:45,267
but Hisa Sensei said: "Stop it, you are going to hurt yourselves".

175
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:49,467
From that day, he never said anything to me anymore.

176
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:56,467
Even in Osaka during the joint training, he made me seat beside him.

177
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:01,967
He used to tell me: "You can see, it is not going well"

178
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:06,500
"These techniques are not very good are they?"

179
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,333
I nodded, a bit embarrassingly

180
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:14,467
and he told me: "Go and teach them how to do it properly".

181
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:23,300
As soon as you are held, all is decided already.

182
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:29,667
At least for Uchi-kote.

183
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:34,600
And it is that point that leads to Yonkajo

184
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:42,167
If we let go the arm and grab the wrist, this is Aiki-Nage.

185
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,833
Aiki-Nage, that is what it means.

186
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:51,367
So the hand has to...

187
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:58,433
When you grab like that...

188
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:04,700
This is like in "4" (Yonkajo)

189
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,833
"4"... not really, in fact the beginning is a bit like in Uchi-Kote: like this, when you grab like that...

190
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:18,967
and from there, when the grab takes its form, you end up like the end of Yonkajo.

191
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:24,267
But in reality, you prevent the opponent to lock its grab, and you do like this.

192
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:30,233
You grab on top of his grab and when you project like this, this really is Aiki-Nage!

193
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:38,700
The kokyu escapes from there.

194
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:45,933
This is the meaning of Aiki.

195
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:49,600
It is the Kokyu that we call "Aiki"

196
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,700
Some people write obscure books about Aiki that no one understand.

197
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,133
Nothing makes sense, even if you read several times,

198
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,933
because it is not something that can be written about.

199
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:09,133
We speak about kindness, Ai-Jo, but in Ken too we talk of Ai right?

200
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:15,433
Because Kokyu-ryoku is the point, it is the power of Kokyu.

201
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:26,133
This is why Kokyu was present in all the Budo, all of them have Kokyu as a reference,

202
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,267
but nobody talks about that.

203
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:41,433
Only in Daito-ryu, do we speak about it, but Daito-ryu is Aiki-jujutsu, it is different in ways such as what we just saw before.

204
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:46,167
That is all. It is Kaeshi waza.

205
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:52,600
We write it "Aiki".

206
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,800
The one that starts like this is "Aiki"

207
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:05,767
What we did the other day was "Ichi-Gaki", it is Aiki.

208
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:09,533
In this case, we grab.

209
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:23,933
This is how you must grab, you must breath in, and if you are grabbed, it is the same for him.

210
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,133
This Kokyu-Ho is Aiki?

211
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,533
Yes, Aiki,

212
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:37,100
it means "unifying the Ki",

213
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,867
"having Ki [being in good shape]",

214
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,900
"having vitality".

215
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:50,100
This is why nobody understands when we talk about this.

216
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:56,200
It is not as philosophical as people would like to think.

217
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,600
It it the same Ki as in "What a nice weather"

218
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:06,000
That is how you should understand "There is no cloud in the sky".

219
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,400
The Ki of Tenki [weather] is the same as the Ki in Aikido.

220
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:17,400
And this is with this "Kimochi" [feeling] that we do it.

221
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,967
This is how you explain it.

222
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:26,433
I have explained that to them.

223
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:42,767
On that topic, they also asked me to explain it in the Daito-Kan newsletter.

224
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:55,633
Some Kaeshi forms that we spoke about originate from sword techniques, and by putting Kokyu into it,

225
00:27:55,633 --> 00:28:00,367
it gives Aiki.

226
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,367
From the Katana, there are usual forms that give forms.

227
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:11,800
Yes, whether or not there is a sword, the Ki is still there.

228
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,867
This is what people don't understand.

229
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,267
Even today, this is not understood.

230
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:20,033
From that point, we never do like this.

231
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:24,467
We place the thumb,

232
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:28,067
and then give the atemi.

233
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:46,500
If you do it like this, it does not work well.

234
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,100
Do it like this.

235
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,167
Not like this, the feeling is this one.

236
00:28:56,433 --> 00:29:00,133
It becomes like an armor's gauntlet for his hand.

237
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:07,867
The easiest way to throw someone is to go where he is not.

238
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,767
If you do this he won't go.

239
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:19,500
This is the same point as earlier.

240
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,133
We go behind him, this breaks the balance,

241
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,033
Not like that.

242
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:56,000
Otherwise you lose your advantage.

243
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:12,267
Start from here, turn, and get to where his wrist closes upon itself.

244
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,267
Then you do as if you were looking at yourself in a mirror in your hand, and then...

245
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:30,000
This is what Hiji-kaeshi [giving back the elbow] means.
