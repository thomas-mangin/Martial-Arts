00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,230

it's not one of the

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,240
it's not one of the
 

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:15,070
it's not one of the
nicest techniques will mov say from CID

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,080

 

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,310

but

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,320
but
 

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,390
but
SM you can't just do that but when

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
SM you can't just do that but when
 

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,990
SM you can't just do that but when
you're doing this one two

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,000

 

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,030

you should

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,040
you should
 

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,590
you should
be inside just in your head your

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
be inside just in your head your
 

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,030
be inside just in your head your
imagination you should feel

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
imagination you should feel
 

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,869
imagination you should feel
it

18
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:39,879
it
 

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,150
it
so they used to say s used to vanish not

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
so they used to say s used to vanish not
 

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,069
so they used to say s used to vanish not
to people who watching them because they

22
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
to people who watching them because they
 

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,590
to people who watching them because they
could see what he was doing but to the

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,600
could see what he was doing but to the
 

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,950
could see what he was doing but to the
person who was on the end of it got

26
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
person who was on the end of it got
 

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,470
person who was on the end of it got
attack

28
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
attack
 

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,910
attack
he you'd

30
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:54,920
he you'd
 

31
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:05,990
he you'd
seen so this

32
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
