not I breathe okay because when you
 

343
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,590
not I breathe okay because when you
breathe it generates the late flexion

344
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:42,600
breathe it generates the late flexion
 

345
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,670
breathe it generates the late flexion

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:06,440
you might have to go to the seated set
 

401
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,750
you might have to go to the seated set
to understand more without me there uh

my philosophy this stuff takes forever
 

409
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,550
my philosophy this stuff takes forever
to learn so I try to uh expedite that

410
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,560
to learn so I try to uh expedite that
 

411
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,430
to learn so I try to uh expedite that
process as much as

412
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
process as much as
 

413
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,310
process as much as
possible

414
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,320
possible
 

415
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,750
possible
um and for that reason

416
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
um and for that reason
 

417
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,069
um and for that reason
I'll go ahead and increase the

418
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
I'll go ahead and increase the
 

419
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,470
I'll go ahead and increase the
stressor um but maybe to the point where

420
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
stressor um but maybe to the point where
 

421
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,430
stressor um but maybe to the point where
that's beyond your C capacity to adapt

422
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
that's beyond your C capacity to adapt
 

423
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,870
that's beyond your C capacity to adapt
and now that's not a cultivation field

424
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880
and now that's not a cultivation field
 

425
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,590
and now that's not a cultivation field
anymore that becomes an application

426
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
anymore that becomes an application
 

427
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,870
anymore that becomes an application
field there's no growth from there okay

428
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:45,880
field there's no growth from there okay
 

429
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,670
field there's no growth from there okay
so um someone asked me one time like um

430
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:50,680
so um someone asked me one time like um
 

431
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,990
so um someone asked me one time like um
why do you why do you work from katate

432
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,000
why do you why do you work from katate
 

433
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,269
why do you why do you work from katate
why don't you work from on the Torso

434
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
why don't you work from on the Torso
 

435
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,509
why don't you work from on the Torso
since it has so much to do with it and

436
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
since it has so much to do with it and
 

437
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,590
since it has so much to do with it and
we do there are those videos where we

438
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
we do there are those videos where we
 

439
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,470
we do there are those videos where we
climb up the arm and I'll demonstrate

440
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,480
climb up the arm and I'll demonstrate
 

441
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,470
climb up the arm and I'll demonstrate
that right here um but the reason why is

442
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:05,480
that right here um but the reason why is
 

443
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,030
that right here um but the reason why is
because the ego triar type mind is so

444
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
because the ego triar type mind is so
 

445
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,870
because the ego triar type mind is so
oriented towards external that I want to

446
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
oriented towards external that I want to
 

447
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,470
oriented towards external that I want to
tackle that problem more fully by giving

448
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
tackle that problem more fully by giving
 

449
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,949
tackle that problem more fully by giving
you the the lust of pushing on something

450
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:19,959
you the the lust of pushing on something
 

451
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,949
you the the lust of pushing on something
so that's why I stick that hand out okay

452
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
so that's why I stick that hand out okay
 

453
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,470
so that's why I stick that hand out okay
um but here we're going to take that

454
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
um but here we're going to take that
 

455
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,189
um but here we're going to take that
hand away and so and we're going to take

456
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,199
hand away and so and we're going to take
 

457

the legs away and and understand this
 

459
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,550
the legs away and and understand this
positioning so first let me show you

460
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
positioning so first let me show you
 

461
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,030
positioning so first let me show you
what we're working with will you take

462
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,040
what we're working with will you take
 

463

myself for the rotation that comes from
 

557
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,150
myself for the rotation that comes from
the fact that we have one side of the

558
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,160
the fact that we have one side of the
 

559
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,949
the fact that we have one side of the
body forward versus the other so we

560
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:07,959
body forward versus the other so we
 

561
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,310
body forward versus the other so we
should be able to see this let's go to

562
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:11,320
should be able to see this let's go to
 

563
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,670
should be able to see this let's go to
the last

the last
 

565
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,590
the last
drill you okay and he's going to

566
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
drill you okay and he's going to
 

567
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,550
drill you okay and he's going to
drive

come forward in her you see the reason
 

577
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,870
come forward in her you see the reason
we only saw one come forward put the

578
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:35,880
we only saw one come forward put the
 

579
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,389
we only saw one come forward put the
foot back is because only one shoulder

580
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
foot back is because only one shoulder
 

581
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,430
foot back is because only one shoulder
is being affected do you see that but

582
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,440
is being affected do you see that but
 

583
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,710
is being affected do you see that but
prior to you coming forward we saw the

prior to you coming forward we saw the
 

585
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,550
prior to you coming forward we saw the
compromisation of it going back so the

586
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:45,560
compromisation of it going back so the
 

587
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,590
compromisation of it going back so the
skill that is still missing is how do I

588
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,600
skill that is still missing is how do I
 

589
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,150
skill that is still missing is how do I
hold structural Integrity in light of

590
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
hold structural Integrity in light of
 

591
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,350
hold structural Integrity in light of
this rotational Force okay that's what

592
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
this rotational Force okay that's what
 

593
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,350
this rotational Force okay that's what
that's where we're going to go okay

594
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
that's where we're going to go okay

00:17:50,520 --> 00:18:03,789
that I don't seek any mechanical
advantage over him or anything

658
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:03,799

 

659
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,430

you can see I got a little push keep

660
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:06,440
you can see I got a little push keep
 

661
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,270
you can see I got a little push keep
going but I release

662
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,280

 

663
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,830

it you only get pushed because you Flex

664
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
it you only get pushed because you Flex
 

665
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:24,029
it you only get pushed because you Flex
so I release it

666
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:24,039

 

667
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,470

Again release it

668
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,480
Again release it
 

669
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,630
Again release it
again okay

670
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:31,640

 

671
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,110

and what I'm doing here is I get to

672
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
and what I'm doing here is I get to
 

673
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,070
and what I'm doing here is I get to
release tension and two I'm going to

674
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
release tension and two I'm going to
 

675
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,669
release tension and two I'm going to
work on

676
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
work on
 

677
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,950
work on
this positional Integrity of the Torso

678
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:45,960
this positional Integrity of the Torso
 

679
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,110
this positional Integrity of the Torso
do you get that because that's where a

680
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,120
do you get that because that's where a
 

681
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,549
do you get that because that's where a
lot that that's another place that is

682
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:50,559
lot that that's another place that is
 

683
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,669
lot that that's another place that is
very difficult um releasing tension in

684
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
very difficult um releasing tension in
 

685
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,310
very difficult um releasing tension in
lower legs is very difficult and

686
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
lower legs is very difficult and
 

687
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,310
lower legs is very difficult and
maintaining rotational integrity in the

688
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
maintaining rotational integrity in the
 

689
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,510
maintaining rotational integrity in the
Torso is also very difficult at first we

690
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:02,520
Torso is also very difficult at first we
 

691
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,230
Torso is also very difficult at first we
meaning we tend to do it through flexion

692
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,240
meaning we tend to do it through flexion
 

693
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,110
meaning we tend to do it through flexion
and

694
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
and
 

695
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,510
and
contestation okay so that's where we're

696
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
contestation okay so that's where we're
 

697
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,909
contestation okay so that's where we're
going so let's we're going to try this

698
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
going so let's we're going to try this
 

699
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,390
going so let's we're going to try this
drill for a little bit

700
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:15,400

 

701
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,710

okay okay so stay there and don't move

702
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
okay okay so stay there and don't move
 

703
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,070
okay okay so stay there and don't move
but you can see he has this

704
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,080

 

705
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,710

orientation here's your shoulder back do

706
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:27,720
orientation here's your shoulder back do
 

707
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,750
orientation here's your shoulder back do
you see that so we we came here and so

708
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:30,760
you see that so we we came here and so
 

709
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,909
you see that so we we came here and so
we're assuring it we're trying to get

710
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:32,919
we're assuring it we're trying to get
 

711
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,350
we're assuring it we're trying to get
skeletal alignment okay and that's why I

712
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
skeletal alignment okay and that's why I
 

713
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,029
skeletal alignment okay and that's why I
like to work with katate and not on the

714
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:40,039
like to work with katate and not on the
 

715
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,630
like to work with katate and not on the
Torso okay cuz this is a stronger

716
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:43,640
Torso okay cuz this is a stronger
 

717
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,149
Torso okay cuz this is a stronger
Catalyst for the ego tripartite mind

718
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:47,159
Catalyst for the ego tripartite mind
 

719
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,789
Catalyst for the ego tripartite mind
than the Torso is you you could fix your

720
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:49,799
than the Torso is you you could fix your
 

721
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,149

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320

 

759
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,190

go and not it's not external it's

760
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,200
go and not it's not external it's
 

761
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,990
go and not it's not external it's
internal

trying to do it don't

766
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,080
trying to do it don't
 

767
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,149
trying to do it don't
move uh I feel the tension in the

768
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:09,159
move uh I feel the tension in the
 

769
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,110
move uh I feel the tension in the
shoulder and I'm trying to get it here

770
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,120
shoulder and I'm trying to get it here
 

771
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,870
shoulder and I'm trying to get it here
so try to release that tension there you

772
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
so try to release that tension there you
 

773
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,630
so try to release that tension there you
go and again it'll rise up because

774
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:19,640
go and again it'll rise up because
 

775
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,750
go and again it'll rise up because
that's what the Mind does and you

776
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
that's what the Mind does and you
 

777
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,510
that's what the Mind does and you
release it Again release again there you

778
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
release it Again release again there you
 

779
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,630
release it Again release again there you
go and again where else do you feel

780
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:31,640
go and again where else do you feel
 

781
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,110
go and again where else do you feel
tension pay attention to the lower back

782
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,120
tension pay attention to the lower back
 

783
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,710
tension pay attention to the lower back
and the leg still release it again

784
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:39,720

 

785
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,269

good good

786
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:42,279
good good
 

787
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,110
good good
okay um so again the drill is not really

788
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
okay um so again the drill is not really
 

789
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,630
okay um so again the drill is not really
to make to keep positional it's not a

790
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:49,640
to make to keep positional it's not a
 

791
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,909
to make to keep positional it's not a
positional Integrity drill wh why would

792
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
positional Integrity drill wh why would
 

793
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,029
positional Integrity drill wh why would
it be um we're never going to contest

794
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
it be um we're never going to contest
 

795
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,310
it be um we're never going to contest
for space this is where I deviate

796
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,320
for space this is where I deviate
 

797
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,430
for space this is where I deviate
radically from from uh Adam Meisner

798
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,440
radically from from uh Adam Meisner
 

799
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,510
radically from from uh Adam Meisner
because he sticks with that cultivation

800
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:02,520
because he sticks with that cultivation
 

801
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,549
because he sticks with that cultivation
field I am never going to stay in place

802
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:05,559
field I am never going to stay in place
 

803
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,310
field I am never going to stay in place
the non-c contestation is going to

804
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
the non-c contestation is going to
 

805
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,870
the non-c contestation is going to
concentrically expand out from the

806
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
concentrically expand out from the
 

807
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,230
concentrically expand out from the
internal to the external and I will

808
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,240
internal to the external and I will
 

809
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,350
internal to the external and I will
never contest for space let alone just

810
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,360
never contest for space let alone just
 

811
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,710
never contest for space let alone just
be uh handle it inside that's not what

812
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:19,720
be uh handle it inside that's not what
 

813
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,269
be uh handle it inside that's not what
we do here um and so likewise the drill

814
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:24,279
we do here um and so likewise the drill
 

815
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,590
we do here um and so likewise the drill
is not about positional Integrity the

816
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,600
is not about positional Integrity the
 

817
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,350
is not about positional Integrity the
the stressor is positional integrity

818
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
the stressor is positional integrity
 

819
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,510
the stressor is positional integrity

another very similar uration a mistake
 

851
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,110
another very similar uration a mistake
in understanding the drill um we're

852
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,120
in understanding the drill um we're
 

853
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,149
in understanding the drill um we're
going to do the one where he climbs up

854
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
going to do the one where he climbs up
 

855
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,590
going to do the one where he climbs up
the arm so he he has to trade grips and

the arm so he he has to trade grips and
 

857
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,590
the arm so he he has to trade grips and
allowing me to move he'll climb up to

time okay
 

947
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,389
time okay
so I kind of let beginners work with set

948
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:46,399
so I kind of let beginners work with set
 

949
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,830
so I kind of let beginners work with set
and then we start to work with unset as

950
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:48,840
and then we start to work with unset as
 

951
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,350
and then we start to work with unset as
we get going

952
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,360
we get going
 

953
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,269
we get going
okay but setting with tension that has

954
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
okay but setting with tension that has
 

955
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,230
okay but setting with tension that has
to be addressed from the very beginning

956
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,240
to be addressed from the very beginning
 

957
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,029

is take
 

963
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,510
is take
away this alignment and urge to push by

doesn't change it if you have to do this

1028

doesn't change it if you have to do this
 

1029
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,430
doesn't change it if you have to do this
then you don't have the spinal Integrity

1030
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
then you don't have the spinal Integrity
 

1031
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,630
then you don't have the spinal Integrity
okay if you get

1032
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:23,640
okay if you get
 

1033
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,909
okay if you get
rotated you don't have the spinal

1034
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
rotated you don't have the spinal
 

1035
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,590
rotated you don't have the spinal
Integrity because that spine rotated

1036
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:28,600
Integrity because that spine rotated
 

1037
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,870
Integrity because that spine rotated
spinal Integrity is

1038
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
spinal Integrity is
 

1039
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,830
spinal Integrity is
here that's why this stuff works spinal

1040
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:34,840
here that's why this stuff works spinal
 

1041
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,509
here that's why this stuff works spinal
Integrity is

1042
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:36,519

1043
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:39,269

here I would have to rotate my spine in

1044
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
here I would have to rotate my spine in
 

1045
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,310
here I would have to rotate my spine in
order to fall victim to that okay all

1046
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,320
order to fall victim to that okay all
 

1047
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,789
order to fall victim to that okay all
right so we're going to try this seated

1048
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
right so we're going to try this seated
 

1049
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,630
right so we're going to try this seated
drill and I recommend you try this drill

1050
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:47,640
drill and I recommend you try this drill
 

1051
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,230
drill and I recommend you try this drill
because you tend to have so much tension

1052
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
because you tend to have so much tension
 

1053
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,909
because you tend to have so much tension
and iido

1054

trickery that you're hiding from
 

1057
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,310

1059
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,470

Integrity okay all right so we're going

1060
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
Integrity okay all right so we're going
 

1061
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,640
