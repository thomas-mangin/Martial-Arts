1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,270

i think he's going i

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
i think he's going i
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,470
i think he's going i
catch it here oh see so when he's

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
catch it here oh see so when he's
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,350
catch it here oh see so when he's
falling i have that break right there

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360

 

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:36,549

do you yield

8
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559

 

9
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,310

is not necessarily external

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320

 

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:55,830

do it internally

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840

 

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,150

don't pull the knife away don't keep it

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160

 

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,630

the throat takes him off of you the

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
the throat takes him off of you the
 

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,750
the throat takes him off of you the
throat takes his grip

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
throat takes his grip
 

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,870
throat takes his grip
off

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880

 

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,390

okay we'll stop there okay

22
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400

 

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,510

so he goes

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
so he goes
 

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,670
so he goes
i'm not trying to do that

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
i'm not trying to do that
 

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,590
i'm not trying to do that
i'm not hitting him so hard that he

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
i'm not hitting him so hard that he
 

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,590
i'm not hitting him so hard that he
falls down and his feet come

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
falls down and his feet come
 

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,510
falls down and his feet come
forward that's not what i'm doing

32
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
forward that's not what i'm doing
 

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,670
forward that's not what i'm doing
i have to tilt him i have to tilt him

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
i have to tilt him i have to tilt him
 

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,350
i have to tilt him i have to tilt him
and then i have to rotate

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360

 

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,870

it takes more energy to create a toffee

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
it takes more energy to create a toffee
 

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,270
it takes more energy to create a toffee
turkey effect

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
turkey effect
 

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,710
turkey effect
on the 12 6 line that means you have to

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
on the 12 6 line that means you have to
 

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,789
on the 12 6 line that means you have to
be capable of generating that energy

44
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
be capable of generating that energy
 

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,910
be capable of generating that energy
that means

46
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
that means
 

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,710
that means
if whatever energy he generated i have

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
if whatever energy he generated i have
 

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,789
if whatever energy he generated i have
to overcome that energy

50
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
to overcome that energy
 

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,230
to overcome that energy
that's not what we're doing let's look

52
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
that's not what we're doing let's look
 

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,630
that's not what we're doing let's look
at the arm

54
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
at the arm
 

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,910
at the arm
of the inward spiral

56
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
of the inward spiral
 

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,949
of the inward spiral
yeah the heaven hat okay

58
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
yeah the heaven hat okay
 

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,510
yeah the heaven hat okay
right now as you use it you're seeing

60
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
right now as you use it you're seeing
 

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,070
right now as you use it you're seeing
kind of

62
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
kind of
 

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,110
kind of
arm bar stuff okay

64
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
arm bar stuff okay
 

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,309
arm bar stuff okay
so you go like this and then you go

66
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
so you go like this and then you go
 

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,470
so you go like this and then you go
move but if you look at the spiral

68
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
move but if you look at the spiral
 

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,190
move but if you look at the spiral
let's let me have him this is just a

70
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
let's let me have him this is just a
 

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,390
let's let me have him this is just a
vector

72
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
vector
 

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,630
vector
force vector so at this point

74
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
force vector so at this point
 

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,509
force vector so at this point
he feels the spiral he feels the

76
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
he feels the spiral he feels the
 

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,309
he feels the spiral he feels the
resistance

78
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
resistance
 

79
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,790
resistance
okay and my job is to get rid of that

80
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
okay and my job is to get rid of that
 

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,229
okay and my job is to get rid of that
resistance

82
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
resistance
 

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,750
resistance
so if that's his mass coming in

84
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
so if that's his mass coming in
 

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,670
so if that's his mass coming in
i'm gonna go around it which you guys

86
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
i'm gonna go around it which you guys
 

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,030
i'm gonna go around it which you guys
are all doing

88
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
are all doing
 

89
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,750
are all doing
but all you're doing now is putting it

90
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
but all you're doing now is putting it
 

91
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,949
but all you're doing now is putting it
right there

92
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
right there
 

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,470
right there
now you push on that but now and if you

94
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
now you push on that but now and if you
 

95
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,229
now you push on that but now and if you
pay attention

96
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
pay attention
 

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,070
pay attention
you stop the spiral or you shrunk it so

98
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
you stop the spiral or you shrunk it so
 

99
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,509
you stop the spiral or you shrunk it so
small

100
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
small
 

101
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,910
small
that it's not obeying the yin yang grid

102
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
that it's not obeying the yin yang grid
 

103
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,030
that it's not obeying the yin yang grid
on on your

104
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
on on your
 

105
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,750
on on your
within your four corners so it's staying

106
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
within your four corners so it's staying
 

107
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,589
within your four corners so it's staying
for example

108
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
for example
 

109
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,270
for example
my yang line is staying on my yarn line

110
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
my yang line is staying on my yarn line
 

111
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,070
my yang line is staying on my yarn line
which is why it projects like young okay

112
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
which is why it projects like young okay
 

113
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,229
which is why it projects like young okay
the hand is supposed to go around

114
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239

 

115
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,350

it goes from the middle around

116
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
it goes from the middle around
 

117
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,509
it goes from the middle around
back to the other side and what you're

118
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
back to the other side and what you're
 

119
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,350
back to the other side and what you're
going to find is that

120
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
going to find is that
 

121
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,309
going to find is that
the elbow is actually going around his

122
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
the elbow is actually going around his
 

123
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,509
the elbow is actually going around his
energy

124
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519

 

125
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,270

it's not going this way

126
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280

 

127
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,390

as he pushes its yielding

128
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
as he pushes its yielding
 

129
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,789
as he pushes its yielding
around so that's going to be our drill

130
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
around so that's going to be our drill
 

131
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,470
around so that's going to be our drill
we'll be here i'll feel him on the elbow

132
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
we'll be here i'll feel him on the elbow
 

133
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,710
we'll be here i'll feel him on the elbow
and i'm going to continue the spiral to

134
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
and i'm going to continue the spiral to
 

135
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,990
and i'm going to continue the spiral to
let him walk it

136
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
let him walk it
 

137
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,630
let him walk it
those little extra one to two inches is

138
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
those little extra one to two inches is
 

139
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,509
those little extra one to two inches is
all you want

140
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
all you want
 

141
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,830
all you want
okay what you're doing now is you don't

142
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
okay what you're doing now is you don't
 

143
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,670
okay what you're doing now is you don't
have it

144
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
have it
 

145
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,350
have it
so we'll go slow and he goes

146
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
so we'll go slow and he goes
 

147
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,710
so we'll go slow and he goes
and here's where you get caught

148
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
and here's where you get caught
 

149
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,110
and here's where you get caught
keep the spiral going and you take one

150
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
keep the spiral going and you take one
 

151
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,789
keep the spiral going and you take one
to two more inches in

152
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
to two more inches in
 

153
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,310
to two more inches in
obviously here no he's coming in

154
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
obviously here no he's coming in
 

155
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,710
obviously here no he's coming in
and he's stuck you see that's where you

156
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
and he's stuck you see that's where you
 

157
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,909
and he's stuck you see that's where you
hit him

158
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
hit him
 

159
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,070
hit him
keep the spiral going and he comes in

160
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
keep the spiral going and he comes in
 

161
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,629
keep the spiral going and he comes in
that is not the same as we go here stuck

162
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
that is not the same as we go here stuck
 

163
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,670
that is not the same as we go here stuck
and he and i go like this you see

164
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
and he and i go like this you see
 

165
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,110
and he and i go like this you see
that's not the spot i'm keeping the

166
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
that's not the spot i'm keeping the
 

167
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,830
that's not the spot i'm keeping the
spiral

168
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
spiral
 

169
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,830
spiral
boom stop

170
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840

 

171
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,150

my hand is still going forward is how

172
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
my hand is still going forward is how
 

173
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,590
my hand is still going forward is how

when he comes in and you feel that he's

194
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
when he comes in and you feel that he's
 

195
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,909
when he comes in and you feel that he's
pushing on you you see

196

pushing on you you see
 

197
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,350

it triggers you well the power goes
 

199
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,310
it triggers you well the power goes
and you try to shove it back and your

and you try to shove it back and your
 

201
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,909
and you try to shove it back and your
technique goes like this

202
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919

 

203
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,909

okay so we're just taking all this out
 

211
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,029
okay so we're just taking all this out
and just dealing with he's coming oh

that's what you guys feel you feel

216
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
that's what you guys feel you feel
 

217
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,590
that's what you guys feel you feel
everyone's gonna feel that part

218

everyone's gonna feel that part
 

219
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,270
everyone's gonna feel that part
it's now what do you do after that okay

220
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
it's now what do you do after that okay
 

221
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,670
it's now what do you do after that okay
what you're supposed to do is free it

222
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
what you're supposed to do is free it
 

223
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,909
what you're supposed to do is free it
so your tactic should be consciously

224
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
so your tactic should be consciously
 

225
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,870
so your tactic should be consciously
chosen right now

226
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
chosen right now
 

227
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,510
chosen right now
it is not consciously chosen so if he's

228
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
it is not consciously chosen so if he's
 

229
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,230
it is not consciously chosen so if he's
coming in

230
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
coming in
 

231
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,510
coming in
you can you can do that you see i

232
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
you can you can do that you see i
 

233
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,230
you can you can do that you see i
consciously chose to do it right now i'm

consciously chose to do it right now i'm
 

235
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,909
consciously chose to do it right now i'm
going to consciously choose

236
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
going to consciously choose
 

237
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,590
going to consciously choose
i can stick him okay and now

238
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
i can stick him okay and now
 

239
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,950
i can stick him okay and now
i'm going to let him free

240
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
i'm going to let him free
 

241
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,430
i'm going to let him free
i'm going to deconstruct the contention

242
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
i'm going to deconstruct the contention
 

243
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,150
i'm going to deconstruct the contention
point

244
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
point
 

245
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,590
point
so i'm conscious consciously stuck

246
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
so i'm conscious consciously stuck

so i'm conscious consciously stuck
that's where you guys push you're going

248
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
that's where you guys push you're going
 

249
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,390
that's where you guys push you're going
to feel that in the technique

250
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
to feel that in the technique
 

251
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,790
to feel that in the technique
but let it go

252
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800

 

253
00:06:46,800 --> 00:07:00,870

won't

254
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880

 

255
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,909

let it go

256
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919

 

257
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,629

don't let it go don't let it go with

258
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
don't let it go don't let it go with
 

259
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,550
don't let it go don't let it go with
movement

260
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
movement
 

261
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,710
movement
it's in the spiral itself is the point

262
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
it's in the spiral itself is the point
 

263
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,670
it's in the spiral itself is the point
of making

264
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
of making
 

265
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:25,190
of making
it's in the spiral itself

266
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,200

 

267
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:36,950

[Music]

269
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,230

okay let's go okay if he's grabbing me

270
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
okay let's go okay if he's grabbing me
 

271
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,990
okay let's go okay if he's grabbing me
i'm not supposed to just be moving his

272
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
i'm not supposed to just be moving his
 

273
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,670
i'm not supposed to just be moving his
arm

274
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
arm
 

275
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,150
arm
where where he's touching me i move his

276
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
where where he's touching me i move his
 

277
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,950
where where he's touching me i move his
body

278
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960

 

279
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,430

so the same thing goes if i'm if i'm

280
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
so the same thing goes if i'm if i'm
 

281
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,189
so the same thing goes if i'm if i'm
working here

282
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
working here
 

283
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:05,670
working here
i'm moving his butt

284
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680

 

285
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,469

it doesn't change here like even though

286
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
it doesn't change here like even though
 

287
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,550
it doesn't change here like even though
i'm here

288
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
i'm here

291
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,830

at what rate when he heals so he's

292
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
at what rate when he heals so he's
 

293
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,790
at what rate when he heals so he's
pushing

294
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
pushing
 

295
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,629
pushing
and he's not not gonna come forward i'm

296
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
and he's not not gonna come forward i'm
 

297
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,990
and he's not not gonna come forward i'm
not blocking him

298
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
not blocking him
 

299
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,029
not blocking him
i'm stuck right here and trying to come

300
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
i'm stuck right here and trying to come
 

301
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,990
i'm stuck right here and trying to come
forward because i'm

i'm down in his feet he tries to walk
 

305
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,870
i'm down in his feet he tries to walk
you can see his balance is going to be

306
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
you can see his balance is going to be
 

307
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,350
you can see his balance is going to be
taken

308
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
taken
 

309
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,110
taken
you see that but you can't have it dead

310
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
you see that but you can't have it dead
 

311
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,750
you see that but you can't have it dead
you're in his body you're controlling

312
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
you're in his body you're controlling
 

313
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,389
you're in his body you're controlling
him

314
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
him
 

315
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,110
him
and that's what starts to turn him that

316
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
and that's what starts to turn him that
 

317
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,670
and that's what starts to turn him that
when i

318
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
when i
 

319
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,829
when i
because i need to be in his body to

320
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
because i need to be in his body to
 

321
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,829
because i need to be in his body to
start doing the movement part

322
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
start doing the movement part
 

323
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,949
start doing the movement part
okay so i'm in his body and i'm not

324
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
okay so i'm in his body and i'm not
 

325
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,910
okay so i'm in his body and i'm not
working with his

326
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
working with his
 

327
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,949
working with his
neck and working

328
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
neck and working
 

329
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,269
neck and working
with his forward energy to get in his

330
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
with his forward energy to get in his
 

331
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,790
with his forward energy to get in his
body okay

332
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
body okay
 

333
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,829
body okay
so he's pushing

334
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
so he's pushing
 

335
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,350
so he's pushing
push really hard okay he's really hot

336
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
push really hard okay he's really hot
 

337
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,430
push really hard okay he's really hot
that's what he's doing he's pushing

338
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
that's what he's doing he's pushing
 

339
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,750
that's what he's doing he's pushing
really hard and round vectoring

340
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
really hard and round vectoring
 

341
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,590
really hard and round vectoring
and i'm going to do this spiral with my

342
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600

and that same contention point

360
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
and that same contention point
 

361
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,790
and that same contention point
i have to release it like bring him into

362
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
i have to release it like bring him into
 

363
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,870

switch you're like oh i can do this size
we don't get to pick our size

520
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120

 

521
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,629

yeah get your hip in there get the

522
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
yeah get your hip in there get the
 

523
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,230
yeah get your hip in there get the
ground vector on the left foot do it

524
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
ground vector on the left foot do it
 

525
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,150
ground vector on the left foot do it
again on the larger

526
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
again on the larger
 

527
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,350
again on the larger
you got to get the left foot ground

528
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
you got to get the left foot ground
 

529
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,509
you got to get the left foot ground
vector now

530
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
vector now
 

531
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,430
vector now
try it again don't hope for it do it

532
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440

 

533
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,990

better cycle through

534
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000

 

535
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,829

good shorter movements right tighten it

536
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
good shorter movements right tighten it
 

537
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:45,110
good shorter movements right tighten it
up

538
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120

 

539
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,189

try it again get your left arm more

540
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
try it again get your left arm more
 

541
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,030
try it again get your left arm more
engaged or your right arm

542
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
engaged or your right arm
 

543
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,550
engaged or your right arm
right on more engaged

544
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560

 

545
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,870

oh try it again ground vector left foot

546
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880

 

547
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:12,230

there you go

548
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240

 

549
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,829

[Music]

550
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839

 

551
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,880

so

552
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:20,890

 

553
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:28,230

[Applause]

554
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240

 

555
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,310

oh i always want to push on people

556
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320

 

557
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,230

get that ground vector

558
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240

 

559
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,070

yield internally don't let the elbow

560
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
yield internally don't let the elbow
 

561
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,830
yield internally don't let the elbow
back

562
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840

 

563
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,710

better

564
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
better
 

565
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,630
better
you let that elbow back that's where you

566
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
you let that elbow back that's where you
 

567
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,990
you let that elbow back that's where you
spiral you're getting stuck

568
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
spiral you're getting stuck
 

569
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,350
spiral you're getting stuck
on him because you feel this pressure

570
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
on him because you feel this pressure
 

571
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:59,270
on him because you feel this pressure
you push on it

572
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280

 

573
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,950

step with that though

574
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960

 

575
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:12,549

cycle through

576
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559

 

577
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:22,710

ground vacuum

578
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720

 

579
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,789

that's it

580
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799

 

581
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,870

you're keeping them out do it again same

582
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
you're keeping them out do it again same
 

583
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,789
you're keeping them out do it again same
side

584
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
side
 

585
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,470
side
in release there it is same thing here

586
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
in release there it is same thing here
 

587
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,240
in release there it is same thing here
