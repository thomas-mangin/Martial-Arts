so what what was happening and I was
watching your group there is they feel a

36
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,940
watching your group there is they feel a
 

37
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,449
watching your group there is they feel a
little projection so they feel a little

38
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:23,459
little projection so they feel a little
 

39
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,850
little projection so they feel a little
you see a little and then but they take

40
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:25,860
you see a little and then but they take
 

41
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,949
you see a little and then but they take
off now into them

42
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959

 

43
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,009

and it's kind of just like I'm trying to

44
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:34,019
and it's kind of just like I'm trying to
 

45
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,649
and it's kind of just like I'm trying to
do a bench press you know with just in

46
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:36,659
do a bench press you know with just in
 

47
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,350
do a bench press you know with just in
terms of force and then my spotter comes

48
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
terms of force and then my spotter comes
 

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,390
terms of force and then my spotter comes
up and takes the bar off off me because

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
up and takes the bar off off me because
 

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,449
up and takes the bar off off me because
see that so it's kind of it's kind of

52
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459
see that so it's kind of it's kind of
 

53
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,970
see that so it's kind of it's kind of
like that even though it's not muscular

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:46,980
like that even though it's not muscular
 

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,570
like that even though it's not muscular
okay it's a way of the UK bleeding off

56
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,580
okay it's a way of the UK bleeding off
 

57
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,789
okay it's a way of the UK bleeding off
the energy okay

58
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
the energy okay
 

59
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,530
the energy okay
so in order for me to get a decent wrap

60
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:57,540
so in order for me to get a decent wrap
 

61
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,830
so in order for me to get a decent wrap
let's say you you feel that you see and

62
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
let's say you you feel that you see and
 

63
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,750
let's say you you feel that you see and
then they start falling right away but

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:02,760
then they start falling right away but
 

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,030
then they start falling right away but
if you pay attention when I go here

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
if you pay attention when I go here
 

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,410
if you pay attention when I go here
there's no reason to fall do you see so

68
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,420
there's no reason to fall do you see so
 

69
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,289
there's no reason to fall do you see so
for example if I go here and then you

70
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,299
for example if I go here and then you
 

71
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,310
for example if I go here and then you
feel me take it back

72
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320

 

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,330

but

74
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,340

 

75
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,009

people will feel that and then go right

76
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,019
people will feel that and then go right
 

77
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,150
people will feel that and then go right
into them

78
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,160
into them
 

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,790
into them
okay so if that's the case

80
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
okay so if that's the case
 

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,469
okay so if that's the case
and I stay where I am then there's no

82
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
and I stay where I am then there's no
 

83
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,890
and I stay where I am then there's no
more conditioning no more Pokemon

84
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:32,900
more conditioning no more Pokemon
 

85
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,969
more conditioning no more Pokemon
okay so I might I for here and you

86
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:37,979
okay so I might I for here and you
 

87
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:45,409
okay so I might I for here and you
starting to fall I would follow you

88

89
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,810

um I wouldn't necessarily
 

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,689
um I wouldn't necessarily
ask the question from the arm point of

94
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:53,699
ask the question from the arm point of
 

95
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,409
ask the question from the arm point of
view

96
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:54,419

97
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,490

okay I would ask more what is your

98
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,500
okay I would ask more what is your
 

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,870
okay I would ask more what is your
vector

100
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
vector
 

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,490
vector
uh

102
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:01,500
uh
 

103

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,740
as you're rebounding energy back into
 

105
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,590
as you're rebounding energy back into
them okay so for example we're here and

back break while like some energies
 

345
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,650
back break while like some energies
coming in well

346
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
coming in well
 

347
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,030
coming in well
and you do it again

348
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,040

 

349
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,910

and do it with your best form for the

backbreakable
 

353
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,050
backbreakable
all right

354
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,060
all right
 

355
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,630

359
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,250

is he pretty organized so for example uh

360
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,260
is he pretty organized so for example uh
 

361
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,370
is he pretty organized so for example uh
let's sit on your bottom and put your

362
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,380
let's sit on your bottom and put your
 

363
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,350
let's sit on your bottom and put your
feet out

364
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
feet out
 

365
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,769
feet out
separate them and we'll do that uh in

366
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:30,779
separate them and we'll do that uh in
 

367
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,389
separate them and we'll do that uh in
chemi drill where you lock your Center

368
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
chemi drill where you lock your Center
 

369
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,389
chemi drill where you lock your Center
and you go around okay

370
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:35,399
and you go around okay
 

371
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,329
and you go around okay
we go

372
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:38,339

 

373
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,329

now it should be where the broken Center

374
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:41,339
now it should be where the broken Center
 

375
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,610
now it should be where the broken Center
mushy Center would look like in that

376
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:43,620
mushy Center would look like in that
 

377
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,190
mushy Center would look like in that
drill yes keep going

378
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,200
drill yes keep going
 

379
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,690
drill yes keep going
yes

380
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:47,700
yes
 

381
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:58,670
yes
and let's organize it again

382
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:58,680

 

383
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,230

okay whoo all right

384
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,240

 

385
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,550

so uh when we doing the technique and

386
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:07,560
so uh when we doing the technique and
 

387
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,329
so uh when we doing the technique and
you can see it did you feel it okay

388
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:11,339
you can see it did you feel it okay
 

389
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,670
you can see it did you feel it okay
see it got disorganized and you look you

390
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
see it got disorganized and you look you
 

391
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,530
see it got disorganized and you look you
did the mushiness do you see that right

392
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
did the mushiness do you see that right
 

393
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,910
did the mushiness do you see that right
okay so let's try uh and so that makes

394
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
okay so let's try uh and so that makes
 

395
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,370
okay so let's try uh and so that makes
you not projectable but from your side

396
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,380
you not projectable but from your side
 

397
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,370
you not projectable but from your side
you are now not doing the training from

398
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,380
you are now not doing the training from
 

399
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,250
you are now not doing the training from
the inside okay so when you locked your

400
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,260
the inside okay so when you locked your
 

401
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,090
the inside okay so when you locked your
body with that Center organization and

402
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,100
body with that Center organization and
 

403
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,069
body with that Center organization and
if you pay attention not to you but to

404
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,079
if you pay attention not to you but to
 

405
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,490
if you pay attention not to you but to
me do you see my central organization is

406
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:40,500
me do you see my central organization is
 

407
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,769
me do you see my central organization is
doing the same thing

408
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:42,779
doing the same thing
 

409
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,009
doing the same thing
So You Train 50 and you've got mushy

410
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,019
So You Train 50 and you've got mushy
 

411
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,470
So You Train 50 and you've got mushy
again okay and you can see you hold your

412
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
again okay and you can see you hold your

see static lists but if you understand
the list statically you you suck that

698
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:27,480
the list statically you you suck that
 

699
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,490
the list statically you you suck that
your ego tripartite mind has you okay

700
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:31,500
your ego tripartite mind has you okay
 

701
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,890

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,909
see me do that every once in a while but
I'm a firm believer of

don't have your internal drills be so

748
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,140
don't have your internal drills be so
 

749
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,169
don't have your internal drills be so
far removed from your Tactical

750
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:54,179
far removed from your Tactical
 

751
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,690
far removed from your Tactical
architectures

752
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,700
architectures
 

753
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,770
architectures
um

754
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:57,780
um
 

755
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,990
um
don't do that because you'll have a

756
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
don't do that because you'll have a
 

757
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,610
don't do that because you'll have a
bigger stepping stone when you try to

758
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:01,620
bigger stepping stone when you try to
 

759
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,970
bigger stepping stone when you try to
put them into practice okay the internal

760
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:04,980
put them into practice okay the internal
 

761
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,529
put them into practice okay the internal
drills are exaggerations and extending

762
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:09,539
drills are exaggerations and extending
 

763
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,430
drills are exaggerations and extending
of the internal aspect moment for the

764
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
of the internal aspect moment for the
 

765
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,029
of the internal aspect moment for the
reason of cultivating it but in fighting

766
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
reason of cultivating it but in fighting
 

767
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,149
reason of cultivating it but in fighting
it's never going to be that long neither

768
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
it's never going to be that long neither
 

769
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,850
it's never going to be that long neither
in in how much it travels through space

770
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:22,860
in in how much it travels through space
 

771
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,770
in in how much it travels through space
or how long a duration okay

772
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:27,780

 

773
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,409

um so already you're looking at that's

774
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:30,419
um so already you're looking at that's
 

775
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,630
um so already you're looking at that's
pretty far enough away from my tactical

776
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
pretty far enough away from my tactical
 

777
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,690
pretty far enough away from my tactical
architectures okay and if I start doing

778
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:35,700
architectures okay and if I start doing
 

779
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,010
architectures okay and if I start doing
things like for example I do two yins

780
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,020
things like for example I do two yins
 

781
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,789
things like for example I do two yins
that kind of works in terms of uh uh

782
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:43,799
that kind of works in terms of uh uh
 

783
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,049
that kind of works in terms of uh uh
an internal projection but go back but

784
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:48,059
an internal projection but go back but
 

785
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,690
an internal projection but go back but
I'm going to get head butt boom on the

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:50,700
I'm going to get head butt boom on the
 

787
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,690
I'm going to get head butt boom on the
way in it's not going to work okay

788
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:53,700
way in it's not going to work okay
 

789
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,049
way in it's not going to work okay
so what your Ico does in ITS Tactical

790
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:57,059
so what your Ico does in ITS Tactical
 

791
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,750
so what your Ico does in ITS Tactical
architecture is one hand is going to go

792
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
architecture is one hand is going to go
 

793
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,310
architecture is one hand is going to go
in

794
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,320
in
 

795
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,010
in
and the other hand goes yum

796
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,020
and the other hand goes yum
 

797
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,590
and the other hand goes yum
one hand goes again the other hand goes

798
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:06,600
one hand goes again the other hand goes
 

799
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,710
one hand goes again the other hand goes
young you have to watch when you're both

800
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:09,720
young you have to watch when you're both
 

801
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,669
young you have to watch when you're both
gone or you're both young

gone or you're both young
 

803
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,370
gone or you're both young
some of you are going both in not

804
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,380
some of you are going both in not
 

805
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,909
some of you are going both in not
realizing it and you're all jacked up

806
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
realizing it and you're all jacked up
 

807
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,990
realizing it and you're all jacked up
okay it's hard making it harder for you

808
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,000

 

809
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,450

there's another reason why Aikido does

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,460
there's another reason why Aikido does
 

811
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,810
there's another reason why Aikido does
one year when young even though you you

812
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:32,820
one year when young even though you you
 

813
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,390
one year when young even though you you
don't have to so well you don't have to

814
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,400
don't have to so well you don't have to
 

815
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,970
don't have to so well you don't have to
you see you don't have to but there's a

816
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:37,980
you see you don't have to but there's a
 

817
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,250
you see you don't have to but there's a
reason why I key to the desert and it's

818
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,260
reason why I key to the desert and it's
 

819
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,890
reason why I key to the desert and it's
because of that Prime that perennial

820
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:42,900
because of that Prime that perennial
 

821
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,390
because of that Prime that perennial
philosophy you always work both sides of

822
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,400
philosophy you always work both sides of
 

823
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,310
philosophy you always work both sides of
the yin yang

824
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,320
the yin yang
 

825
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,890
the yin yang
and you always integrate them and you

826
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:51,900
and you always integrate them and you
 

827
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,870
and you always integrate them and you
always reconcile them and you always

828
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:53,880
always reconcile them and you always
 

829
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,190
always reconcile them and you always
transcend them okay and that is again

830
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,200
transcend them okay and that is again
 

831
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,529
transcend them okay and that is again
another reason aside from the Tactical

832
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:00,539
another reason aside from the Tactical
 

833
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,169
another reason aside from the Tactical
architectural reason that you don't want

834
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:03,179
architectural reason that you don't want
 

835
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,110
architectural reason that you don't want
to have two yins or two Yarns okay work

836
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
to have two yins or two Yarns okay work
 

837
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,149
to have two yins or two Yarns okay work
the two together

838
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:11,159
the two together
 

839
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,610
the two together
so I'm going to standardize them right

840
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:13,620
so I'm going to standardize them right
 

841
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,990
so I'm going to standardize them right
now

842
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,000
now
 

843
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,529
now
okay we're gonna go to the right

844
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:18,539
okay we're gonna go to the right
 

845
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,470
okay we're gonna go to the right
so this will be my

846
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:21,480
so this will be my
 

847
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,769
so this will be my
Yin hand over the top this is my young

848
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:24,779
Yin hand over the top this is my young
 

849
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,630
