would call a micro drill which

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:28,119
would call a micro drill which
 

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,229
would call a micro drill which
means it is drilling for a

8
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
means it is drilling for a
 

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,389
means it is drilling for a
singular or a very reduced amount of

10
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
singular or a very reduced amount of
 

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,869

aspects
 

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,270
aspects
um versus a drill like you're doing a

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
um versus a drill like you're doing a
 

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,709
um versus a drill like you're doing a
drill uh like kihon waza there's lots of

18
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
drill uh like kihon waza there's lots of
 

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,470
drill uh like kihon waza there's lots of
aspects in it or

20
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
aspects in it or
 

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,950
aspects in it or
scenario even more okay so koku hold

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
scenario even more okay so koku hold
 

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,910
scenario even more okay so koku hold
micro drilling for

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
micro drilling for
 

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,430
micro drilling for
C uh

26
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
C uh

CQ is a type of force engine I'm I'm

28
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:06,920
CQ is a type of force engine I'm I'm
 

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,550
CQ is a type of force engine I'm I'm
going to try to use modern terms for

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,560
going to try to use modern terms for
 

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,550
going to try to use modern terms for
people

32
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
people
 

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,590
people
who not have not experienced it don't

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
who not have not experienced it don't
 

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,870
who not have not experienced it don't
know what it is and have been misled by

36
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:15,880
know what it is and have been misled by
 

37
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,590
know what it is and have been misled by
a lot of Bido people who do not have C

38
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
a lot of Bido people who do not have C
 

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,429
a lot of Bido people who do not have C
and cannot manifest

40
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
and cannot manifest
 

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,429
and cannot manifest
CQ it's a type of force

42
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:24,439
CQ it's a type of force
 

43
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,190
CQ it's a type of force
engine uh in particular it's a

44
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
engine uh in particular it's a
 

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,789
engine uh in particular it's a
rebounding Force engine

46
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
rebounding Force engine
 

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,510
rebounding Force engine
so

48
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
so
 

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,310
so
um not a rebounding Force engine let's

50
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
um not a rebounding Force engine let's
 

51
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,350
um not a rebounding Force engine let's
say like a a propelling force engine

52
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,360
say like a a propelling force engine
 

53
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,389
say like a a propelling force engine
would be like boom a punch a rebounding

54
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
would be like boom a punch a rebounding
 

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,749
would be like boom a punch a rebounding
engine would be more like when he hits

56
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:46,759
engine would be more like when he hits
 

57
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,469
engine would be more like when he hits
my fist and then he bounces off of

58
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,479

 

59
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,149

it in terms of Yin

60
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
it in terms of Yin
 

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,870
it in terms of Yin
Yong it is his y aspect

62
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
Yong it is his y aspect
 

63
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,789
Yong it is his y aspect
that I am going to

64
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:03,799
that I am going to
 

65
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,389
that I am going to
internalize allow to pass through

66
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:07,399
internalize allow to pass through
 

67
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,469
internalize allow to pass through
me

68
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:09,479
me
 

69
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,030
me
hit the

70
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,040
hit the
 

71
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,790
hit the
Earth come back through me and hit him

72
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:17,800
Earth come back through me and hit him
 

73
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,869
Earth come back through me and hit him
that's the rebounding just to put it

74
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:19,879
that's the rebounding just to put it
 

75
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,509
that's the rebounding just to put it
simply it's a rebounding Force

76
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,519
simply it's a rebounding Force
 

77
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,150
simply it's a rebounding Force
engine

78
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
engine
 

79
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,589
engine
okay in

80
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:26,599
okay in
 

81
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,710
okay in
iido the way that iido uses it

82
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
iido the way that iido uses it
 

83
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,190
iido the way that iido uses it
is you're going to see there is a lot of

84
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
is you're going to see there is a lot of
 

85
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,390
is you're going to see there is a lot of
Yin external movements that will set up

86
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
Yin external movements that will set up
 

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,470
Yin external movements that will set up
the rebounding Force engine okay so for

88
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
the rebounding Force engine okay so for
 

89
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,149
the rebounding Force engine okay so for
example

90
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
example
 

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,270
example
um I'm not going to sit here and uh just

92
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
um I'm not going to sit here and uh just
 

93
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,390
um I'm not going to sit here and uh just
push him over with a propelling

94
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,400

 

95
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,070

engine but I I also won't just sit here

96
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,080
engine but I I also won't just sit here
 

97
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,630
engine but I I also won't just sit here
and try to project him you're going to

98
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
and try to project him you're going to
 

99
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,509
and try to project him you're going to
see that I'm going to do a Yin

100
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:04,519
see that I'm going to do a Yin
 

101
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,509
see that I'm going to do a Yin
movement and then I'll rebound off of

102
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
movement and then I'll rebound off of
 

103
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,670
movement and then I'll rebound off of
him

104
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
him
 

105
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,030
him
here so as he's coming in I'm going to

106
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,040
here so as he's coming in I'm going to
 

107
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,589
here so as he's coming in I'm going to
yield and he'll hit that there okay so

108
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:18,599
yield and he'll hit that there okay so
 

109
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,710
yield and he'll hit that there okay so
it looks something like

110
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:21,720

 

111
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,149

this you're going to see that all the

112
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
this you're going to see that all the
 

113
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,630
this you're going to see that all the
time in all of your once you see it once

114
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
time in all of your once you see it once
 

115
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,429
time in all of your once you see it once
you know what it is so uh let's say he's

116
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
you know what it is so uh let's say he's
 

117
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,990
you know what it is so uh let's say he's
doing some pushing same thing

118
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,000
doing some pushing same thing
 

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,710
doing some pushing same thing
here I'm going to clear it and you're

120
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
here I'm going to clear it and you're
 

121
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,910
here I'm going to clear it and you're
going to see it again it's over here so

122
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
going to see it again it's over here so
 

123
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,789
going to see it again it's over here so
you see a yield and then a rebound

124
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799

 

125
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,589

boom once you see it you should be able

126
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
boom once you see it you should be able
 

127
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,470
boom once you see it you should be able
to see it everywhere okay so it doesn't

128
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
to see it everywhere okay so it doesn't
 

129
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,069
to see it everywhere okay so it doesn't
have to be with him grabbing me it

130
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,079
have to be with him grabbing me it
 

131
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,789
have to be with him grabbing me it
doesn't have to be with me grabbing him

132
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
doesn't have to be with me grabbing him
 

133
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,550
doesn't have to be with me grabbing him
it doesn't have to be be on the arms or

134
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,560
it doesn't have to be be on the arms or
 

135
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,910
it doesn't have to be be on the arms or
anything like that okay and it doesn't

136
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
anything like that okay and it doesn't
 

137
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,670
anything like that okay and it doesn't
have to be with my hands either so some

138
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
have to be with my hands either so some
 

139
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,589
have to be with my hands either so some
example of Not My Cross not my hands is

140
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:14,599
example of Not My Cross not my hands is
 

141
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,710
example of Not My Cross not my hands is
here's his movement he I'm going to

142
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
here's his movement he I'm going to
 

143
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,030
here's his movement he I'm going to
yield and then I'll bounce them off of

144
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
yield and then I'll bounce them off of
 

145
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,390
yield and then I'll bounce them off of
my body so

146
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
my body so
 

147
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,909
my body so
boom okay or you have your

148
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
boom okay or you have your
 

149
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,830
boom okay or you have your
throws here right it's now not in his

150
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:30,840
throws here right it's now not in his
 

151
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,510
throws here right it's now not in his
wrist it's going to be on his neck he

152
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:34,520
wrist it's going to be on his neck he
 

153
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
wrist it's going to be on his neck he
bounces off a

154
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,530
bounces off a
 

155
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,670
bounces off a
[Music]

156
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680

 

157
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,510

bit same exact thing there's going to be

158
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
bit same exact thing there's going to be
 

159
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,629
bit same exact thing there's going to be
a yield and you can think of it as the

160
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
a yield and you can think of it as the
 

161
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,670
a yield and you can think of it as the
yield loads the rebounding tactic

162
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
yield loads the rebounding tactic
 

163
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,550
yield loads the rebounding tactic
okay so when we were doing M two hand

164
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
okay so when we were doing M two hand
 

165
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,629
okay so when we were doing M two hand
grab and we're doing this technique

166
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
grab and we're doing this technique
 

167
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,670
grab and we're doing this technique
where we're coming

168
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
where we're coming
 

169
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,710
where we're coming
around there's your

170
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:05,720
around there's your
 

171
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,469
around there's your
yield so I'm going to

172
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
yield so I'm going to
 

173
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,670
yield so I'm going to
yield and as he comes in I'm loading the

174
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,680

 

175
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,710

rebounding so this not like the throw

176
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,720
rebounding so this not like the throw
 

177
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,230
rebounding so this not like the throw
not like the throw in the video I just

178
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
not like the throw in the video I just
 

179
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,469
not like the throw in the video I just
want you to see the rebound I'm going to

180
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
want you to see the rebound I'm going to
 

181
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,790
want you to see the rebound I'm going to
yield it comes around

182
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:27,800

 

183
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,150

boom so

184
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
boom so
 

185
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,150
boom so
the rebound happens right on his Center

186
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,160
the rebound happens right on his Center
 

187
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,950
the rebound happens right on his Center
Line it's not

188
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:35,960
Line it's not
 

189
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,350
Line it's not
over where you're doing a kind of like e

this way
 

193
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,830
this way
no and there's no need to bend my elbow

194
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:46,840
no and there's no need to bend my elbow
 

195
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,230
no and there's no need to bend my elbow
and cut him down the yield of the Iden

196
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
and cut him down the yield of the Iden
 

197
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,830
and cut him down the yield of the Iden
con did it so you notice that in the

198
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
con did it so you notice that in the
 

199
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,189
con did it so you notice that in the
first video my arm never bends there's

200
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
first video my arm never bends there's
 

201
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,350
first video my arm never bends there's
no need to bend it the

202
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
no need to bend it the
 

203
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,950
no need to bend it the
yielding

204
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:01,960
yielding
 

205
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,950
yielding
tactic was in the movement of the body

206
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
tactic was in the movement of the body
 

207
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,909
tactic was in the movement of the body
and the arm opening up

208
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
and the arm opening up
 

209
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,390
and the arm opening up
okay even when I went straight

210
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
okay even when I went straight
 

211
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,309
okay even when I went straight
up as my arm goes up that's the yielding

212
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
up as my arm goes up that's the yielding
 

213
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,270
up as my arm goes up that's the yielding
tactic and that's what it

214
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280

 

215
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,990

is I don't need to bend my

216
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
is I don't need to bend my
 

217
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,990
is I don't need to bend my
elbow push him down that's a propulsion

218
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,000
elbow push him down that's a propulsion
 

219
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,589
elbow push him down that's a propulsion
engine okay so to use the rebound engine

220
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:30,599
engine okay so to use the rebound engine
 

221
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,189
engine okay so to use the rebound engine
I'm going to use my movement and my arm

222
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,199
I'm going to use my movement and my arm
 

223
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm going to use my movement and my arm
to set up the

224
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
to set up the
 

225
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,189
to set up the
rebounding engine so I'm moving

226
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:42,199

 

227
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,830

around okay now for the

228
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
around okay now for the
 

229
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,909
around okay now for the
throw let's say he's pushing at me he's

230
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:48,919
throw let's say he's pushing at me he's
 

231
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,309
throw let's say he's pushing at me he's
never going to get in with the with the

232
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
never going to get in with the with the
 

233
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,790
never going to get in with the with the
c you I I can hold it here so I'm going

234
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
c you I I can hold it here so I'm going
 

235
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,670
c you I I can hold it here so I'm going
to let it go up you see let Hiser CER

236
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
to let it go up you see let Hiser CER
 

237
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,510
to let it go up you see let Hiser CER
come up just so slightly and then the

238
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
come up just so slightly and then the
 

239
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,510
come up just so slightly and then the
rebounding is here on his

240
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,520
rebounding is here on his
 

241
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,070
rebounding is here on his
chest back past his

242
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
chest back past his
 

243
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,790
chest back past his
stance so you're going to let him

244
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
stance so you're going to let him
 

245
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,909
stance so you're going to let him
up and then this is loading

246
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919

 

247
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,510

here no different than this one loading

248
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
here no different than this one loading
 

249
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,469
here no different than this one loading
here that's the I I

250
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479

 

251
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,309

want this one just let It Center up

252
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
want this one just let It Center up
 

253
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,270
want this one just let It Center up
and that's where you rebound there so

254
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
and that's where you rebound there so
 

255
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,670
and that's where you rebound there so
you have the Dr there's the

256
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
you have the Dr there's the
 

257
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,909
you have the Dr there's the
yield you have the T C let him hit

258
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:40,919
yield you have the T C let him hit
 

259
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,869
yield you have the T C let him hit
it and you have to let their Center

260
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:43,879
it and you have to let their Center
 

261
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,990
it and you have to let their Center
through so you can't be here Center

262
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,000
through so you can't be here Center
 

263
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,230
through so you can't be here Center
never come through I could rebound from

264
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,240
never come through I could rebound from
 

265
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,749
never come through I could rebound from
here but he'll just go straight out so

266
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
here but he'll just go straight out so
 

267
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,270
here but he'll just go straight out so
in the yield it goes up the center comes

268
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,280
in the yield it goes up the center comes
 

269
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,390
in the yield it goes up the center comes
through and that's where the rebounding

270
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
through and that's where the rebounding
 

271
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,270
through and that's where the rebounding
engine hits so let's say he's here

272
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,280
engine hits so let's say he's here
 

273
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,189
engine hits so let's say he's here
I'm going to let It Center up stay there

274
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
I'm going to let It Center up stay there
 

275
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,350
I'm going to let It Center up stay there
imagine they let their Center up by

276
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
imagine they let their Center up by
 

277
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,270
imagine they let their Center up by
letting it go through and then the

278
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
letting it go through and then the
 

279
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,430
letting it go through and then the
rebounding

280
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:08,440
rebounding
 

281
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,990
rebounding
energy pushes there but it's not that

282
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
energy pushes there but it's not that
 

283
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,430
energy pushes there but it's not that
would be a propulsion engine what I want

284
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,440
would be a propulsion engine what I want
 

285
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,309
would be a propulsion engine what I want
is a re

286
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:21,319

 

287
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:28,230

out and you see my arm is

288
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240

 

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,269

straight

290
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:32,279

 

291
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,990

okay let's

292
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,000
okay let's
 

293
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,029
okay let's
try Okay common

294
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039

 

295
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,469

mistakes your rebounding

296
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
mistakes your rebounding
 

297
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,910
mistakes your rebounding
energy is only going to

298
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
energy is only going to
 

299
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,230
energy is only going to
be as

300
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
be as
 

301
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,630
be as
projecting as you

302
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
projecting as you
 

303
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,269
projecting as you
absorbed and that is a difficult part

304
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
absorbed and that is a difficult part
 

305
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,269
absorbed and that is a difficult part
for people because they don't want they

306
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
for people because they don't want they
 

307
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,030
for people because they don't want they
don't want to have it come in but you

308
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,040
don't want to have it come in but you
 

309
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,150
don't want to have it come in but you
have to let it come in okay the more it

310
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,160
have to let it come in okay the more it
 

311
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,509
have to let it come in okay the more it
comes in the more you can store it the

312
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:06,519
comes in the more you can store it the
 

313
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,790
comes in the more you can store it the
more you can project it so in terms of

314
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
more you can project it so in terms of
 

315
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,790
more you can project it so in terms of
Yin and

316
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:09,800
Yin and
 

317
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,829
Yin and
Yong the more Yin the more

318
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
Yong the more Yin the more
 

319
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,910
Yong the more Yin the more
y the less y the less y so for example

320
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:18,920
y the less y the less y so for example
 

321
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,790
y the less y the less y so for example
if I don't let him in there's not much

322
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:21,800
if I don't let him in there's not much
 

323
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,910
if I don't let him in there's not much
projection even if I am going to do it

324
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:24,920
projection even if I am going to do it
 

325
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,310
projection even if I am going to do it
internally so I won't let them in it's

326
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
internally so I won't let them in it's
 

327
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,990
internally so I won't let them in it's
small

328
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
small
 

329
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
small
well if I let him in it

330
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
well if I let him in it
 

331
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,430
well if I let him in it
stores

332
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,440
stores
 

333
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,829
stores
okay so in this

334
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:36,839
okay so in this
 

335
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,030
okay so in this
throw you not only want to obey the rule

336
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,040
throw you not only want to obey the rule
 

337
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,150
throw you not only want to obey the rule
that the more you absorb the more you

338
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
that the more you absorb the more you
 

339
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,230
that the more you absorb the more you
can

340
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,240
can
 

341
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,949
can
project but in order to get the kazushi

342
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
project but in order to get the kazushi
 

343
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,990
project but in order to get the kazushi
I need his Center to come forward of his

344
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
I need his Center to come forward of his
 

345
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,389
I need his Center to come forward of his
head that way he's in this

346
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
head that way he's in this
 

347
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,430
head that way he's in this
position and my rebounding energy even

348
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
position and my rebounding energy even
 

349
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,550
position and my rebounding energy even
though my arm is here I'm rebounding at

350
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
though my arm is here I'm rebounding at
 

351
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,269
though my arm is here I'm rebounding at
this point where he's contacting boom

352
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:04,279
this point where he's contacting boom
 

353
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,990
this point where he's contacting boom
into that line that rebounding energy is

354
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,000
into that line that rebounding energy is
 

355
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,190
into that line that rebounding energy is
going

356
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
going
 

357
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,670
going
there so I I have to let him

358
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:12,680
there so I I have to let him
 

359
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,870
there so I I have to let him
in and then

360
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
in and then
 

361
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,190
in and then
project it's not that I'm cutting down

362
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,200
project it's not that I'm cutting down
 

363
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,230
project it's not that I'm cutting down
on

364
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,240
on
 

365
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,750
on
here when you see my hand drop it's

366
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:22,760
here when you see my hand drop it's
 

367
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,670
here when you see my hand drop it's
because it was relaxed and he his hands

368
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,680
because it was relaxed and he his hands
 

369
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,750
because it was relaxed and he his hands
went down so I'll try to keep my

370
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
went down so I'll try to keep my
 

371
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,030
went down so I'll try to keep my
up and you can see that the projection

372
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
up and you can see that the projection
 

373
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,790
up and you can see that the projection
already happened what you see at the end

374
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:35,800
already happened what you see at the end
 

375
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,710
already happened what you see at the end
is

376
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
is
 

377
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,190
is
that because there's nothing holding it

378
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
that because there's nothing holding it
 

379
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,990
that because there's nothing holding it
up any okay so don't try to cut him down

380
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
up any okay so don't try to cut him down
 

381
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,910
up any okay so don't try to cut him down
so there's no need to bend your elbow

382
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
so there's no need to bend your elbow
 

383
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,629
so there's no need to bend your elbow
and let them in

384
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:48,639
and let them in
 

385
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,230
and let them in
more now if this is your

386
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
more now if this is your
 

387
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,230
more now if this is your
kazushi you're going to get the hips

388
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
kazushi you're going to get the hips
 

389
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,629
kazushi you're going to get the hips
forward and you're going to push the

390
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:55,639
forward and you're going to push the
 

391
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,269
forward and you're going to push the
chest down at this with that rebounding

392
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:58,279
chest down at this with that rebounding
 

393
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,710
chest down at this with that rebounding
energy this

394
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
energy this
 

395
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,470
energy this
Vector if you miss glancing this way you

396
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,480
Vector if you miss glancing this way you
 

397
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,310
Vector if you miss glancing this way you
get something else glancing that way you

398
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
get something else glancing that way you
 

399
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,030
get something else glancing that way you
get something else if it goes straight

400
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
get something else if it goes straight
 

401
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,230
get something else if it goes straight
back you get something else so you

402
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
back you get something else so you
 

403
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,509
back you get something else so you
rebounding energy just can't go wherever

404
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
rebounding energy just can't go wherever
 

405
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,829
rebounding energy just can't go wherever
it has to

406
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:16,839
it has to
 

407
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,030
it has to
go into the

408
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
go into the
 

409
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,389
go into the
angle that's going to do this throw so

410
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
angle that's going to do this throw so
 

411
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,310
angle that's going to do this throw so
if I go to the side it'll turn him okay

412
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:29,320
if I go to the side it'll turn him okay
 

413
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,670
if I go to the side it'll turn him okay
not to the side even as you tank on here

414
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:32,680
not to the side even as you tank on here
 

415
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,870
not to the side even as you tank on here
let him come around into it the tank con

416
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:35,880
let him come around into it the tank con
 

417
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,230
let him come around into it the tank con
version is nothing different than the

418
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
version is nothing different than the
 

419
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,030
version is nothing different than the
ult version I'm still in front of him so

420
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,040
ult version I'm still in front of him so
 

421
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,750
ult version I'm still in front of him so
I'm going to tank con and he comes

422
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm going to tank con and he comes
 

423
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,389
I'm going to tank con and he comes
around there it is right

424
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:47,399
around there it is right
 

425
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,910
around there it is right
there like all your UDA versions okay

426
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
there like all your UDA versions okay
 

427
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,550
there like all your UDA versions okay
you do the

428
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,560
you do the
 

429
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,590
you do the
spiral

430
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
spiral
 

431
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,310
spiral
there okay you just wait for him to come

432
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
there okay you just wait for him to come
 

433
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,750
there okay you just wait for him to come
back onto the

434
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
back onto the
 

435
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,910
back onto the
line okay try it

436
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
line okay try it
 

437
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,269
line okay try it
again okay so if we're down

438
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
again okay so if we're down
 

439
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,629
again okay so if we're down
here and I'm going to do that yield to

440
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:11,639
here and I'm going to do that yield to
 

441
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,110
here and I'm going to do that yield to
load the rebound me

442
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,120

 

443
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,230

boom it doesn't mean that I'm going like

444
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
boom it doesn't mean that I'm going like
 

445
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,389
boom it doesn't mean that I'm going like
that meaning if I go like this he and he

446
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
that meaning if I go like this he and he
 

447
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,829
that meaning if I go like this he and he
he was pushing on me which is what the

448
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:26,839
he was pushing on me which is what the
 

449
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,150
he was pushing on me which is what the
energy the young energy that I rebound

450
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,160
energy the young energy that I rebound
 

451
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,990
energy the young energy that I rebound
it if he's pushing on me fast it's not

452
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
it if he's pushing on me fast it's not
 

453
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,750
it if he's pushing on me fast it's not
going to

going to
 

455
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,990
going to
work so the Yang energy that he has I

456
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
work so the Yang energy that he has I
 

457
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,069
work so the Yang energy that he has I
still take it through the yin phase of

00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079
still take it through the yin phase of
 

459
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,910
still take it through the yin phase of
my movement so he can't push on me this

460
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
my movement so he can't push on me this
 

461
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,629
my movement so he can't push on me this
arm is not going to get here so that way

understand but some of you are just
lifting and then hoping his Center gets

494
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:43,480
lifting and then hoping his Center gets
 

495
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,069
lifting and then hoping his Center gets
there it's not going to get there that

496
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:45,079
there it's not going to get there that
 

497
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,350
there it's not going to get there that
way okay so I come

498
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
way okay so I come
 

499
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,990
way okay so I come
around and I

500
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
around and I
 

501
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,790
around and I
control even at this weird angle he

502
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:55,800
control even at this weird angle he
 

503
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,069
control even at this weird angle he
tries to

504
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:57,079
tries to
 

505
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,870
tries to
push he's it's grounded here he's

506
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
push he's it's grounded here he's
 

507
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,790
push he's it's grounded here he's
pushing that way doesn't

508
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:03,800
pushing that way doesn't
 

509
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,550
pushing that way doesn't
matter so don't just go here like

510
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,560
matter so don't just go here like
 

511
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,150
matter so don't just go here like
this that's different does that look

512
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
this that's different does that look
 

513
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,870
this that's different does that look
different there's extension boom you

514
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
different there's extension boom you
 

515
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,990
different there's extension boom you
will feel that and that although it's

516
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
will feel that and that although it's
 

517
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,790
will feel that and that although it's
not rebounding yet it's being stored and

518
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
not rebounding yet it's being stored and
 

519
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,509
not rebounding yet it's being stored and
he feels that feels that the entire time

520
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:24,519
he feels that feels that the entire time
 

521
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,350
he feels that feels that the entire time
there's no even though it's a Yin

522
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
there's no even though it's a Yin
 

523
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,189
there's no even though it's a Yin
external he doesn't feel the

524
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:34,199

 

525
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,949

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
him not just getting out of the way so
 

531
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,350
him not just getting out of the way so
that his Center comes forward do you

532
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
that his Center comes forward do you
 

533
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,829
that his Center comes forward do you
understand

534
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:46,839
understand
 

535
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,470
understand
okay some will

536
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,480
okay some will
 

537
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,910
okay some will
see like a

538
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
see like a

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,350
out of the way of the pain that's not
what's

544
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,360
what's
 

545
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,670
what's
happening there is there is no ni you

the rebounding Force engine that's all

572
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
the rebounding Force engine that's all
 

573
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,590
the rebounding Force engine that's all
I'm

574

577
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,910

okay K go so in a rebounding energy I

578
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
okay K go so in a rebounding energy I
 

579
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,309
okay K go so in a rebounding energy I
want to absorb his energy the more I

580
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:30,319
want to absorb his energy the more I
 

581
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,150
want to absorb his energy the more I
absorb the more that comes back out okay

582
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
absorb the more that comes back out okay
 

583
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,990
absorb the more that comes back out okay
and uh the more you

584
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
and uh the more you
 

585
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,110
and uh the more you
Propel the less you

586
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,120
Propel the less you
 

587
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,710
Propel the less you
absorb

588
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:41,720
absorb
 

589
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,910
absorb
okay and the more you Propel after you

590
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
okay and the more you Propel after you
 

591
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,949
okay and the more you Propel after you
project the propulsion energy will take

592
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:49,959
project the propulsion energy will take
 

593
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,389
project the propulsion energy will take
over from the absorption energy okay so

594
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
over from the absorption energy okay so
 

595
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,069
over from the absorption energy okay so
here to get off of uh the

596
00:16:59,069 --> 00:16:59,079
here to get off of uh the
 

597
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,470
here to get off of uh the
a Niko I'm telling you it's not Niko

598
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:01,480
a Niko I'm telling you it's not Niko
 

599
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,230
a Niko I'm telling you it's not Niko
we're going to come here okay if you

600
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,240
we're going to come here okay if you
 

601
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,750
we're going to come here okay if you
Propel your arm you'll slip through his

602
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
Propel your arm you'll slip through his
 

603
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,750
Propel your arm you'll slip through his
grip okay so because it's important

604
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:12,760
grip okay so because it's important
 

605
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,829
grip okay so because it's important
because that's the IU phase of C so I'm

606
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
because that's the IU phase of C so I'm
 

607
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,949
because that's the IU phase of C so I'm
I'm sticking in his arm by his energy

608
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
I'm sticking in his arm by his energy
 

609
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,309
I'm sticking in his arm by his energy
that's coming in and me neither

610
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
that's coming in and me neither
 

611
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,830
that's coming in and me neither
retreating from it nor contesting it I

612
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:28,840
retreating from it nor contesting it I
 

613
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,549
retreating from it nor contesting it I
just sit there

614
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:31,559
just sit there
 

615
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,830
just sit there
neutral and do the same technique

616
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:36,840

 

617
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,350

so doesn't matter if you're on the

618
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,360

 

619
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,830

inside you got to do the same thing

620
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
inside you got to do the same thing
 

621
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,909
inside you got to do the same thing
though you can't just push back you have

622
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
though you can't just push back you have
 

623
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,590
though you can't just push back you have
to let them

624
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
to let them
 

625
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,710
to let them
in to find the angle it's the same

626
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
in to find the angle it's the same
 

627
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,430
in to find the angle it's the same
relaxed

628
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440

 

629
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,230

arm okay we're on the inside to get rid

630
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
arm okay we're on the inside to get rid
 

631
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,950
arm okay we're on the inside to get rid
of the temptation of pushing on the

632
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:01,960
of the temptation of pushing on the
 

633
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,990
of the temptation of pushing on the
apparent Niko but there is no Niko that

okay as a micro drill it's a Twan drill

636
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
okay as a micro drill it's a Twan drill
 

637
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,630
okay as a micro drill it's a Twan drill
so his spinal

638
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
so his spinal
 

639
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,990
so his spinal
penetration is what

640
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,000
penetration is what
 

641
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,630
penetration is what
generates the Yang energy that I

642
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
generates the Yang energy that I
 

643
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,909
generates the Yang energy that I
internalize that I accumulate that I

644
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
internalize that I accumulate that I
 

645
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,870
internalize that I accumulate that I
will eventually rebound okay um but a

646
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:23,880
will eventually rebound okay um but a
 

647
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,990
will eventually rebound okay um but a
lot of the UK get scared because their

648
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,000
lot of the UK get scared because their
 

649
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,110
lot of the UK get scared because their
body can't understand it okay and that

650
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,120
body can't understand it okay and that
 

651
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,270
body can't understand it okay and that
actually works for you as long as you

652
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
actually works for you as long as you
 

653
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,190
actually works for you as long as you
don't let their

654
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
don't let their
 

655
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,590
don't let their
fear through contagion come into you

656
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:40,600
fear through contagion come into you
 

657
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,669
fear through contagion come into you
Their Fear comes into you you'll project

658
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:42,679
Their Fear comes into you you'll project
 

659
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,990
Their Fear comes into you you'll project
you'll you'll Propel okay you have to

660
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
you'll you'll Propel okay you have to
 

661
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,870
you'll you'll Propel okay you have to
stay relaxed they'll be confused by

662
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
