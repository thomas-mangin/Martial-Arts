1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,570

all right on kihon was a

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:05,580
all right on kihon was a
 

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,250
all right on kihon was a
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,260
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa
 

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,249
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa
um

6
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:13,259

 

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,950

it's like a shape

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
it's like a shape
 

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,730
it's like a shape
and you want to

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:18,740
and you want to
 

11
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,670
and you want to
replicate the shape

12
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,680

 

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,050

from there you work with your teacher to

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,060
from there you work with your teacher to
 

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,170
from there you work with your teacher to
understand the shape

16
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:29,180
understand the shape
 

17
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,970
understand the shape
use the shape

18
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:31,980
use the shape
 

19
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,430
use the shape
Etc so let's just start with the shape

20
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440

 

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,209

um first thing is going to be hand

22
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219
um first thing is going to be hand
 

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,750
um first thing is going to be hand
shaped

24
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
shaped
 

25
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,810
shaped
the hand is going to

26
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
the hand is going to
 

27
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,110
the hand is going to
have a cup

28
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
have a cup
 

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,470
have a cup
aspect to your palm

30
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
aspect to your palm
 

31
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,049
aspect to your palm
but that is not made by

32
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,059

 

33
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,189

squeezing your bones in like this

34
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
squeezing your bones in like this
 

35
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,530
squeezing your bones in like this
what you don't want on the Other Extreme

36
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,540
what you don't want on the Other Extreme
 

37
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,649
what you don't want on the Other Extreme
however is the bones of the hand uh

38
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:11,659
however is the bones of the hand uh
 

39
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,310
however is the bones of the hand uh
extending

40
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
extending
 

41
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,350
extending
like this this is not correct okay

42
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360

 

43
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,590

um you have this cup shape to it

44
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
um you have this cup shape to it
 

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,990
um you have this cup shape to it
but not made by

46
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
but not made by
 

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,090
but not made by
you'll see some people doing this stuff

48
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,100
you'll see some people doing this stuff
 

49
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,590
you'll see some people doing this stuff
okay

50
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
okay
 

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,130
okay
or you'll see some people in extension

52
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,140
or you'll see some people in extension
 

53
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,870
or you'll see some people in extension
doing that other mistake okay

54
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880

 

55
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,230

again this is the kihon was a shape and

56
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,240
again this is the kihon was a shape and
 

57
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,830
again this is the kihon was a shape and
as kiah is to be transcended ultimately

58
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
as kiah is to be transcended ultimately
 

59
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,590
as kiah is to be transcended ultimately
the shape is not important but whenever

60
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
the shape is not important but whenever
 

61
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,410
the shape is not important but whenever
you're training in kihonawaza you should

62
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,420
you're training in kihonawaza you should
 

63
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,830
you're training in kihonawaza you should
do the shape and if you don't have the

64
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
do the shape and if you don't have the
 

65
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,249
do the shape and if you don't have the
shape yet you should learn the shape so

66
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:55,259
shape yet you should learn the shape so
 

67
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,830
shape yet you should learn the shape so
there's a cup

68
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
there's a cup
 

69
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,490
there's a cup
aspect to the palm

70
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,500
aspect to the palm
 

71
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,609
aspect to the palm
then your fingers are

72
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:04,619
then your fingers are
 

73
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,510
then your fingers are
long but not tense

74
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
long but not tense
 

75
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,609
long but not tense
if you tense your fingers you're gonna

76
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:10,619
if you tense your fingers you're gonna
 

77
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,970
if you tense your fingers you're gonna
tend to make that first mistake you'll

78
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:12,980
tend to make that first mistake you'll
 

79
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,190
tend to make that first mistake you'll
sympathetically tense the bones in your

80
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,200
sympathetically tense the bones in your
 

81
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,510
sympathetically tense the bones in your
hand okay so my fingers are long

82
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,520
hand okay so my fingers are long
 

83
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,610
hand okay so my fingers are long
and I'll give little points as we go

84
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:22,620
and I'll give little points as we go
 

85
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,930
and I'll give little points as we go
along here

86
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:23,940
along here
 

87
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,790
along here
in the beginning

88
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,800
in the beginning
 

89
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,229
in the beginning
uh you want to have that cup in your

90
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
uh you want to have that cup in your
 

91
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,070
uh you want to have that cup in your
palm

92
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
palm
 

93
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,930
palm
in alignment

94
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:32,940
in alignment
 

95
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,410
in alignment
with your forearm bones to your elbow

96
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,420
with your forearm bones to your elbow
 

97
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,010
with your forearm bones to your elbow
so you don't want it here

98
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,020
so you don't want it here
 

99
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,770
so you don't want it here
this way

100
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780

 

101
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,009

and then pay attention to this middle

102
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:46,019
and then pay attention to this middle
 

103
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,270
and then pay attention to this middle
finger

104
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
finger
 

105
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,550
finger
this finger here

106
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
this finger here
 

107
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,430
this finger here
and I would actually say a point here

108
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,440
and I would actually say a point here
 

109
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,570
and I would actually say a point here
between the middle and the ring

110
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:56,580
between the middle and the ring
 

111
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,190
between the middle and the ring
are

112
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
are
 

113
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,610
are
connected to that Palm

114
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
connected to that Palm
 

115
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,770
connected to that Palm
okay again don't

116
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:03,780
okay again don't
 

117
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,729
okay again don't
flex your fingers but keep them long

118
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:07,739
flex your fingers but keep them long
 

119
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,210
flex your fingers but keep them long
and as you get this hand shape

120
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,220
and as you get this hand shape
 

121
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,670
and as you get this hand shape
keep your forearm

122
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
keep your forearm
 

123
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,170
keep your forearm
relax

124
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
relax
 

125
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,410
relax
not it's not made by attention in your

126
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
not it's not made by attention in your
 

127
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,229
not it's not made by attention in your
in your arms your forearm is very

128
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:21,239
in your arms your forearm is very
 

129
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,949
in your arms your forearm is very
relaxed okay

130
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959

 

131
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,869

shape of the head

132
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:29,879

 

133
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,790

the next shape

134
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:31,800
the next shape
 

135
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,970
the next shape
is the arm

136
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,980
is the arm
 

137
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,670
is the arm
and I'll give you a reference point here

138
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
and I'll give you a reference point here
 

139
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,670
and I'll give you a reference point here
there's only two R movements there

140
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
there's only two R movements there
 

141
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,190
there's only two R movements there
really one movement so it's playing with

142
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
really one movement so it's playing with
 

143
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,890
really one movement so it's playing with
that uh duality

144
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:47,900

 

145
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,550

in place of a Unity okay you're you're

146
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
in place of a Unity okay you're you're
 

147
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,530
in place of a Unity okay you're you're
working through yin and yang back to the

148
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,540
working through yin and yang back to the
 

149
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,170
working through yin and yang back to the
Dao so there's two but ultimately

150
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180
Dao so there's two but ultimately
 

151
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,330
Dao so there's two but ultimately
there's one okay

152
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,340
there's one okay
 

153
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,570
there's one okay
uh one we'll call the inward the inward

154
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
uh one we'll call the inward the inward
 

155
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,890
uh one we'll call the inward the inward
spiral

156
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:03,900
spiral
 

157
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,610
spiral
and the other one is the outward spiral

158
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,620
and the other one is the outward spiral
 

159
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,289
and the other one is the outward spiral
okay

160
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:09,299
okay
 

161
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,289
okay
so I take that hand shape

162
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,299
so I take that hand shape
 

163
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,430
so I take that hand shape
and my hand goes this way and of course

164
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,440
and my hand goes this way and of course
 

165
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,590
and my hand goes this way and of course
it can do the reverse

166
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
it can do the reverse
 

167
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,969
it can do the reverse
this is we'll call the inward spiral

168
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:25,979

 

169
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,390

the hour spiral is just an extension of

170
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
the hour spiral is just an extension of
 

171
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,270
the hour spiral is just an extension of
its reverse

172
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280

 

173
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,689

and then an inversion of it

174
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:35,699
and then an inversion of it
 

175
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,430
and then an inversion of it
in

176
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
in
 

177
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,350
in

how about my elbow
 

247
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,670
how about my elbow
starts on that shoulder line and when I

248
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
starts on that shoulder line and when I

do the inward spiral it will come all
 

251
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,909
do the inward spiral it will come all
the way to that middle line

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
the way to that middle line
 

253
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,090
the way to that middle line
and that is where uh you'll you're going

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,100
and that is where uh you'll you're going
 

255
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,249
and that is where uh you'll you're going
to see that it'll have its yin and yang

256
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,259
to see that it'll have its yin and yang
 

257
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,010
to see that it'll have its yin and yang
phases so as it's moving from the

phases so as it's moving from the
 

259
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,490

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,500
shoulder it's in its uh Yong phase as
 

261
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,249
shoulder it's in its uh Yong phase as
the elbow hits my mid PEC here is

262
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:28,259
the elbow hits my mid PEC here is
 

263
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,650
the elbow hits my mid PEC here is
starting to go in its Yin phase and at

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
starting to go in its Yin phase and at
 

265
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,990
starting to go in its Yin phase and at
the completion of the center line it is

the completion of the center line it is
 

267
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,749
the completion of the center line it is
done it can't go anymore

268

really your elbow you want to be mindful
of not your hand the hand does what it

does
uh the forearm is relaxed as it is but

282
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
uh the forearm is relaxed as it is but
 

283
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,550
uh the forearm is relaxed as it is but
it is the elbow that's actually tracing

284
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
it is the elbow that's actually tracing
 

285
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,469
it is the elbow that's actually tracing
that pattern

287
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,129

um

288
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,139
um
 

289
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,110
um
for the outward

290
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
for the outward
 

291
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,830
for the outward
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral

292
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral
 

293
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,730
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral
it's going to cross over okay so down

294
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
it's going to cross over okay so down
 

295
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,730
it's going to cross over okay so down
it'll reach that midpoint and then come

296
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740
it'll reach that midpoint and then come
 

297
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,450
it'll reach that midpoint and then come
back to the shoulder line okay not not

298
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
back to the shoulder line okay not not
 

299
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,950
back to the shoulder line okay not not
way out here

300
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
way out here
 

301
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,589
way out here
back to the shoulder one

302
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
back to the shoulder one
 

303
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,110
back to the shoulder one
a pattern you can keep in mind is that

304
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
a pattern you can keep in mind is that
 

305
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,710
a pattern you can keep in mind is that
they make hearts they make a heart

306
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
they make hearts they make a heart
 

307
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,110
they make hearts they make a heart
so if you look at our Crest in the back

308
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
so if you look at our Crest in the back
 

309
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,790
so if you look at our Crest in the back
of the crest you have a universal

310
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
of the crest you have a universal
 

311
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,710
of the crest you have a universal
pattern and in the middle of the

312
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
pattern and in the middle of the
 

313
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,110
pattern and in the middle of the
universal pattern is a heart shape so

314
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
universal pattern is a heart shape so
 

315
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,870
universal pattern is a heart shape so
you can kind of use that as long as you

316
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
you can kind of use that as long as you
 

317
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,689
you can kind of use that as long as you
remember that it's not the hand tracing

318
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:47,699
remember that it's not the hand tracing
 

319
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,230
remember that it's not the hand tracing
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow

320
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow
 

321
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,969
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow
is tracing

322
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:55,979

 

323
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,809

so take the hand shape and the arm shape

324
00:07:59,809 --> 00:07:59,819
so take the hand shape and the arm shape
 

325
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,730
so take the hand shape and the arm shape
and in kihonawaza there's never going to

326
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:04,740
and in kihonawaza there's never going to
 

327
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,830
and in kihonawaza there's never going to
be

328
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
be
 

329
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,990
be
uh one side of your body that is making

330
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
uh one side of your body that is making
 

331
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,189
uh one side of your body that is making
the shapes and the other ones not okay

332
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,199
the shapes and the other ones not okay
 

333
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,029
the shapes and the other ones not okay
so for example uh I wouldn't have this

334
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
so for example uh I wouldn't have this
 

335
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,150
so for example uh I wouldn't have this
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so

336
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so
 

337
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,249
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so
this one's in the shape and this arm is

338
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:22,259
this one's in the shape and this arm is
 

339
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,430
this one's in the shape and this arm is
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes

340
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes
 

341
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,029
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes
around and then does this and then I

342
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
around and then does this and then I
 

343
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,129
around and then does this and then I
keep the shapes at all times keep the

344
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:31,139
keep the shapes at all times keep the
 

345
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,630
keep the shapes at all times keep the

shapes at all times
 

347
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,630
shapes at all times
so body's in the shape

348
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
so body's in the shape
 

349
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,630
so body's in the shape
I'd move around in Gigi's not yet well

350
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
I'd move around in Gigi's not yet well
 

351
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,389
I'd move around in Gigi's not yet well
they're still in the shape and they're

352
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:41,399
they're still in the shape and they're
 

353
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,829
they're still in the shape and they're
gonna make

354
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
gonna make
 

355
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,190
gonna make
uh the two shapes together

356
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
uh the two shapes together
 

357
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,470
uh the two shapes together
as opposed to

358
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
as opposed to
 

359
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,550
as opposed to
something here dead over here

360
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
something here dead over here
 

361
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,870
something here dead over here
boom

362
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:53,880
boom
 

363
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,690
boom
they're making the shapes together

364
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:56,700
they're making the shapes together
 

365
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,290
they're making the shapes together
one

366
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,300

 

367
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,050

you'll see the inward spiral and the

368
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,060
you'll see the inward spiral and the
 

369
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,290
you'll see the inward spiral and the
outer spiral on this hand

370
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,300

 

371
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,470

okay

372
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480

 

373
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,329

boom

374
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:14,339

boom boom
boom boom

378
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
boom boom
 

379
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,170
boom boom
for the camera

380
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,180
for the camera
 

381
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,210
for the camera
starting to go

382
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,220
starting to go
 

383
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,750
starting to go
so this hand is starting outward this

384
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
so this hand is starting outward this
 

385
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,970
so this hand is starting outward this
hand is technically starting Inward and

386
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:28,980
hand is technically starting Inward and
 

387
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,310
hand is technically starting Inward and
it's because it's yin yang but then they

388
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,320
it's because it's yin yang but then they
 

389
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,070
it's because it's yin yang but then they
switch so inward goes to outward outward

390
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
switch so inward goes to outward outward
 

391
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,690
switch so inward goes to outward outward
goes to inward

392
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:35,700
goes to inward
 

393
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,670
goes to inward
now here

394
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
now here
 

395
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,550
now here
this way

396
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560

 

397
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,070

boom
 

399
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,350
boom
and then from the back

400
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
and then from the back
 

401
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,990
and then from the back
it's doing that boom

402
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
it's doing that boom
 

403
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,850
it's doing that boom
boom

404
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,860

415
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,290

all right so a good drill on working on

416
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,300
all right so a good drill on working on
 

417
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,630
all right so a good drill on working on
those hand shapes and arm patterns is

418
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
those hand shapes and arm patterns is
 

419
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,850
those hand shapes and arm patterns is
the following so I call this a micro

420
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:16,860
the following so I call this a micro
 

421
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,509
the following so I call this a micro
drill so your Keyhole are drills and

422
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:20,519
drill so your Keyhole are drills and
 

423
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,009
drill so your Keyhole are drills and
we're going to take the hand shape and

424
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,019
we're going to take the hand shape and
 

425
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,430
we're going to take the hand shape and
the arm shapes and the sense that both

426
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
the arm shapes and the sense that both
 

427
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,530
the arm shapes and the sense that both
sides are working

428
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
sides are working
 

429
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,230
sides are working
and make a micro drill just out of those

430
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
and make a micro drill just out of those
 

431
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,490
and make a micro drill just out of those
things okay so you have uh katate and

432
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:37,500
things okay so you have uh katate and
 

433
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,730
things okay so you have uh katate and
you do the inner spiral

434
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:39,740
you do the inner spiral
 

435
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,110
you do the inner spiral
and the outward spiral

436
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120

 

437
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,970

inward spiral

438
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:46,980
inward spiral
 

439
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,069
inward spiral
no

445
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,530

I want to check for the shape so my

446
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:21,540
I want to check for the shape so my
 

447
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,389
I want to check for the shape so my
hands stay the same even though I'm not

448
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:23,399
hands stay the same even though I'm not
 

449
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,850
hands stay the same even though I'm not
using this hand

450
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:25,860
using this hand
 

451
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,370
using this hand
keep that side of my body active you

452
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,380
keep that side of my body active you
 

453
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,650
keep that side of my body active you
kind of do an inward spiral here on the

454
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:30,660
kind of do an inward spiral here on the
 

455
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,210
kind of do an inward spiral here on the
strike as you do the hours

456
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,220

 

457
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:44,210

so all arms are moving

458
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,220

 

459
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,590

the next thing I can do is pay attention

462
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
the next thing I can do is pay attention
 

463
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,590
the next thing I can do is pay attention
to my elbow on that that grid that I put

464
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
to my elbow on that that grid that I put
 

465
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,170
to my elbow on that that grid that I put
on my torso so I don't want it to go out

466
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,180
on my torso so I don't want it to go out
 

467
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,810
on my torso so I don't want it to go out
push please I don't want it to go out

479
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,550

at first you're going to flex everything

480
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,560
at first you're going to flex everything
 

481
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,670
at first you're going to flex everything
uh that is fine

482
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,680
uh that is fine
 

483
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,949
uh that is fine
just remember

484
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
just remember
 

485
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,370
just remember
that as you progress

486
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,380
that as you progress
 

487
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,210
that as you progress
you should not be using any effort to

488
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,220
you should not be using any effort to
 

489
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,370
you should not be using any effort to
accomplish the same means okay uh so at

490
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,380
accomplish the same means okay uh so at
 

491
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,230
accomplish the same means okay uh so at
first

492
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240
first
 

493
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,629
first
you're going to think it's biomechanical

494
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:53,639
you're going to think it's biomechanical
 

495
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,069
you're going to think it's biomechanical
and skeletal alignment which is fine but

496
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
and skeletal alignment which is fine but
 

497
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,550
and skeletal alignment which is fine but
always task yourself with no it's not

498
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,560
always task yourself with no it's not
 

499
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,949
always task yourself with no it's not
okay

500
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
okay
 

501
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,970
okay
uh so uh as we're here in this this

502
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:07,980
uh so uh as we're here in this this
 

503
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,750
uh so uh as we're here in this this
thing again

504
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760

 

505
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,829

the egoic minds see skeletal alignment

506
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
the egoic minds see skeletal alignment
 

507
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,129
the egoic minds see skeletal alignment
do you see and uh they're like well yeah

508
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:19,139
do you see and uh they're like well yeah
 

509
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,269
do you see and uh they're like well yeah
she can't she can't push you or you're

510
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
she can't she can't push you or you're
 

511
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,990
she can't she can't push you or you're
making her energy come up uh so she

512
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,000
making her energy come up uh so she
 

513
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,110
making her energy come up uh so she
can't get a line on you

514
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
can't get a line on you
 

515
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,930
can't get a line on you
um if she really tried she she'd push

516
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
um if she really tried she she'd push
 

517
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,509
um if she really tried she she'd push
you over but no the energy goes back

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
into her okay and you could do whatever
 

521
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,590
into her okay and you could do whatever
she could stand up

522
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
she could stand up
 

523
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,050
she could stand up
and she could push so here you can't say

524
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,060
and she could push so here you can't say
 

525
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,170
and she could push so here you can't say
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't

526
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,180
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't
 

527
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,050
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't
matter that's not what's happening okay

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,750
as I do the pattern
let me just make this shade okay so for

534
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:56,760
let me just make this shade okay so for
 

535
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,069
let me just make this shade okay so for
example

536
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
example
 

537
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,509
example
uh uh you can change where she's at nope

538
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:02,519
uh uh you can change where she's at nope
 

539
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,310
uh uh you can change where she's at nope
uh

540
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
uh
 

541
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,650
uh
everyone might understand that she can't

542
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,660
everyone might understand that she can't
 

543
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,329
everyone might understand that she can't
push so well that way biomechanically

544
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:10,339
push so well that way biomechanically
 

545
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,269
push so well that way biomechanically
but if she stands up

546
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279
but if she stands up
 

547
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,490
but if she stands up
and she's pushing on the elbow again

548
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,500
and she's pushing on the elbow again
 

549
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,190
and she's pushing on the elbow again
nothing happens but at the same time she

550
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,200
nothing happens but at the same time she
 

551
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,769
nothing happens but at the same time she
can't she can't push on the hand either

552
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:21,779
can't she can't push on the hand either
 

553
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,389
can't she can't push on the hand either
she can't push on the hand that way

554
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:23,399
she can't push on the hand that way
 

555
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,410
she can't push on the hand that way
either

556
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,420
either
 

557
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,509
either
see normally you would think that would

558
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:26,519
see normally you would think that would
 

559
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,970
see normally you would think that would
collapse or you would think that elbow

560
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:28,980
collapse or you would think that elbow
 

561
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,550
collapse or you would think that elbow
would push down or something or as she

562
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,560
would push down or something or as she
 

563
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,449
would push down or something or as she
comes from this angle on the elbow she

564
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:35,459
comes from this angle on the elbow she
 

565
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,190
comes from this angle on the elbow she
can't push the elbow that way either

566
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,200
can't push the elbow that way either
 

567
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,750
can't push the elbow that way either
okay

568
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:38,760
okay
 

569
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,269
okay
and you can see that I'm still relaxed

570
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
and you can see that I'm still relaxed
 

571
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,930
and you can see that I'm still relaxed
but at the beginning it's fine

572
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,940
but at the beginning it's fine
 

573
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,870
but at the beginning it's fine
over tense what I would say

574
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
over tense what I would say
 

575
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,949
over tense what I would say
and uh but continually

576
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:51,959
and uh but continually
 

577
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,129
and uh but continually
trust and gain faith in taking tension

578
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:55,139
trust and gain faith in taking tension
 

579
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,189
trust and gain faith in taking tension
while keeping the shapes that's your

580
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,199
while keeping the shapes that's your
 

581
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,250
while keeping the shapes that's your
goal get the shape and then keep the

582
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,260
goal get the shape and then keep the
 

583
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,750
goal get the shape and then keep the
shape as you take away more and more uh

584
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
shape as you take away more and more uh
 

585
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,449
shape as you take away more and more uh
mechanical thinking and more and more

586
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,459
mechanical thinking and more and more
 

587
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,850
mechanical thinking and more and more
muscle tension

588
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:13,860

 

589
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,449

so it looks like these shapes you're

590
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:17,459
so it looks like these shapes you're
 

591
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,430
so it looks like these shapes you're
going to need more shapes

592
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
going to need more shapes
 

593
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,650
going to need more shapes
to do your Aikido

594
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:21,660
to do your Aikido
 

595
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,350
to do your Aikido
so you're like where's my where's my up

596
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,360
so you're like where's my where's my up
 

597
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,530
so you're like where's my where's my up
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in

598
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,540
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in
 

599
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,389
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in
the art don't it's not in the keyhole

600
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:29,399
the art don't it's not in the keyhole
 

601
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,449
the art don't it's not in the keyhole
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh

602
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:32,459
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh
 

603
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,269
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh
where's my my inward outward Perry wax

604
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
where's my my inward outward Perry wax
 

605
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,850
where's my my inward outward Perry wax
sound wax off it's not in the art okay

606
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:37,860
sound wax off it's not in the art okay
 

607
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,509
sound wax off it's not in the art okay
so with these with these two spirals

608
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
so with these with these two spirals
 

609
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,170
so with these with these two spirals
with this heart-shaped spiral

610
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,180
with this heart-shaped spiral
 

611

with this heart-shaped spiral
um

612
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
um
 

613
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,790
um
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki

614
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki
 

615
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,329
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki
and your Thai sabaki you generate

616
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:53,339
and your Thai sabaki you generate
 

617
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,389
and your Thai sabaki you generate
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow

618
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow
 

619
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,430
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow
band or whatever you wanted to do with

620
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,440
band or whatever you wanted to do with
 

621
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,069
band or whatever you wanted to do with
the robot arms or the wax all wax off

622
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,079
the robot arms or the wax all wax off
 

623
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,829
the robot arms or the wax all wax off
okay

624
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
okay
 

625
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,350
okay
um so keep that in mind that I have to I

626
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,360
um so keep that in mind that I have to I
 

627
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,110
um so keep that in mind that I have to I
can only do these shapes I can only do

628
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
can only do these shapes I can only do
 

629
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,170
can only do these shapes I can only do
these two Spirals and then I have to

630
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,180
these two Spirals and then I have to
 

631
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,050
these two Spirals and then I have to
make up whatever I want with how I move

632
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,060
make up whatever I want with how I move
 

633
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,030
make up whatever I want with how I move
my body and how I move my feet okay

634
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,040

 

635
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,090

all right Shake

636
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,100
all right Shake
 

637
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,569
all right Shake
there is a shape to the waza and it too

638
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:29,579
there is a shape to the waza and it too
 

639
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,769
there is a shape to the waza and it too
is going to be the spiral in nature and

640
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:33,779
is going to be the spiral in nature and
 

641
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,930
is going to be the spiral in nature and
when we say spiral you don't want to

642
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:35,940
when we say spiral you don't want to
 

643
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,990
when we say spiral you don't want to
think two-dimensional nothing is

644
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,000
think two-dimensional nothing is
 

645
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,569
think two-dimensional nothing is
two-dimensional in quinoa

646
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:41,579
two-dimensional in quinoa
 

647
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,370
two-dimensional in quinoa
so

648
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:43,380
so
 

649
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,870
so
um

650
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
um
 

651
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,150
um
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a

652
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a
 

653
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,730
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a
two-dimensional spiral okay so for

654
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,740
two-dimensional spiral okay so for
 

655
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,050
two-dimensional spiral okay so for
example uh the technique is here it's

656
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,060
example uh the technique is here it's
 

657
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,870
example uh the technique is here it's
not a matter of me getting out of the

658
00:16:59,870 --> 00:16:59,880
not a matter of me getting out of the
 

659
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,170
not a matter of me getting out of the
way we're now looking at six o'clock and

660
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,180
way we're now looking at six o'clock and
 

661
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,470
way we're now looking at six o'clock and
then uh accelerating them to six o'clock

662
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
then uh accelerating them to six o'clock
 

663
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,329
then uh accelerating them to six o'clock
and they they roll

664
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339

 

665
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,870

this is not the shape of the technique

666
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
this is not the shape of the technique
 

667
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,569
this is not the shape of the technique
uh you will not have the angle of

668
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:17,579
uh you will not have the angle of
 

669
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,090
uh you will not have the angle of
cancellations that you want and you're

670
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,100
cancellations that you want and you're
 

671
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,730
cancellations that you want and you're
also not repeating the shape which is

672
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
also not repeating the shape which is
 

673
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,669
also not repeating the shape which is
necessary for deeper understandings of

674
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
necessary for deeper understandings of
 

675
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,930
necessary for deeper understandings of
the art so the art is spiral in nature

676
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:29,940
the art so the art is spiral in nature
 

677
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,669
the art so the art is spiral in nature
and something to look for then is uh one

678
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
and something to look for then is uh one
 

679
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,730
and something to look for then is uh one
an angle cancellation so let's define

680
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:37,740
an angle cancellation so let's define
 

681
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,669
an angle cancellation so let's define
that uh let's say she just has a

682
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:40,679
that uh let's say she just has a
 

683
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,730
that uh let's say she just has a
fighting stance okay

684
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:42,740
fighting stance okay
 

685
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,870
fighting stance okay
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal

686
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:47,880
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal
 

687
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,210
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal
line that is traversing the three planes

688
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,220
line that is traversing the three planes
 

689
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,390
line that is traversing the three planes
of height width and depth okay so for

690
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,400
of height width and depth okay so for
 

691
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,610
of height width and depth okay so for
example if I go this way straight across

692
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:55,620
example if I go this way straight across
 

693
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,190
example if I go this way straight across
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation

694
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,200
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation
 

695
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,830
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation
but not as she comes around 360 with the

696
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:00,840
but not as she comes around 360 with the
 

697
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,590
but not as she comes around 360 with the
elbow or what have you

698
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
elbow or what have you
 

699
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,250
elbow or what have you
um also straight down doesn't stop her

700
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,260
um also straight down doesn't stop her
 

701
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,789
um also straight down doesn't stop her
from punching me in the face okay

702
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:09,799
from punching me in the face okay
 

703
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,070
from punching me in the face okay
instead it's going to go diagonally in

704
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
instead it's going to go diagonally in
 

705
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,690
instead it's going to go diagonally in
and down

706
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:14,700
and down
 

707
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,690
and down
and this will create

708
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:17,700
and this will create
 

709
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,970
and this will create
um mechanical checks

710
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
um mechanical checks
 

711
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,510
um mechanical checks
just simply put here on all weapons in

712
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
just simply put here on all weapons in
 

713
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,549
just simply put here on all weapons in
the three zones of height width and

714
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:25,559
the three zones of height width and
 

715
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,169
the three zones of height width and
depth so uh she tries to kick

716
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,179
depth so uh she tries to kick
 

717
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,409
depth so uh she tries to kick
or she tries to punch

718
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:33,419
or she tries to punch
 

719
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,029
or she tries to punch
and that in in uh in effect will create

720
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:38,039
and that in in uh in effect will create
 

721
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,970
and that in in uh in effect will create
a field of operation we'll call it a

722
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:40,980
a field of operation we'll call it a
 

723
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,190
a field of operation we'll call it a
Zona Sanctuary okay

724
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
Zona Sanctuary okay
 

725
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,430
Zona Sanctuary okay
in the technique jujinage that's what we

726
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,440
in the technique jujinage that's what we
 

727
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,390
in the technique jujinage that's what we
called it

728
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,400
called it
 

729
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,990
called it
uh I don't care what you call it okay

730
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,000
uh I don't care what you call it okay
 

731
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,049
uh I don't care what you call it okay
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do

732
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:56,059
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do
 

733
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,789
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do
remember this hand is ultimately going

734
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
remember this hand is ultimately going
 

735
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,510
remember this hand is ultimately going
to do the out the hour spiral this way

736
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:02,520
to do the out the hour spiral this way
 

737
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,970
to do the out the hour spiral this way
so that means it has to begin first

738
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:04,980
so that means it has to begin first
 

739
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,350
so that means it has to begin first

inward
 

741
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,250
inward
and you can see that you're creating a

742
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,260
and you can see that you're creating a
 

743
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,650
and you can see that you're creating a
place that you can be and operate from

I know I move into that spot
 

755
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,950
I know I move into that spot
but I don't now accelerate her that way

756
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
but I don't now accelerate her that way
 

757
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,570

her whole body
 

761
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,470
her whole body
and she'll go that way

762
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480

 

763
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,930

get your angle cancellation move into
 

769
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,830
get your angle cancellation move into
your zone of sanctuary and then she's

770

your zone of sanctuary and then she's
 

771
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,400
your zone of sanctuary and then she's
going to go that way

00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
okay we'll skip back to that
 

851
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,610
okay we'll skip back to that
so one

852
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:58,620
so one
 

853
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,310
so one
there's the zoneus sanctuary this is

854
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,320
there's the zoneus sanctuary this is
 

855
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,490
there's the zoneus sanctuary this is
where I do my rotation okay and not

856
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:04,500
where I do my rotation okay and not
 

857
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,350
where I do my rotation okay and not
going to throw it that way she's gonna

858
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:06,360
going to throw it that way she's gonna
 

859
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,070
going to throw it that way she's gonna
go around me okay so if we remember her

860
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
go around me okay so if we remember her
 

861
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,370
go around me okay so if we remember her
body is coming around right here

862
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,380
body is coming around right here
 

863
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,950
body is coming around right here
you'll see a triangle

864
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
you'll see a triangle
 

865
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,730
you'll see a triangle
this is your uh opening your tsuki for

866
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:19,740
this is your uh opening your tsuki for
 

867
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,450
this is your uh opening your tsuki for
edini you need a Yin space that you can

868
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:23,460
edini you need a Yin space that you can
 

869
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,890
edini you need a Yin space that you can
enter in

870
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:24,900
enter in
 

871
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,770
enter in
okay this is where I entered

872
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:27,780
okay this is where I entered
 

873
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,730
okay this is where I entered
okay

874
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:31,740

 

875
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,430

uh sorry

876
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,440
uh sorry
 

877
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,710
uh sorry
what I don't want to do is accelerate

878
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
what I don't want to do is accelerate
 

879
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,430
what I don't want to do is accelerate
your elbow

880
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,440

 

881
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,890

and not accelerating her elbow

882
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:42,900
and not accelerating her elbow
 

883
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,570
and not accelerating her elbow
I'm going to

884
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:44,580
I'm going to
 

885
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,190
I'm going to
move into the edema space as she's about

886
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
move into the edema space as she's about
 

887
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
move into the edema space as she's about
to go around like use me for balance

888
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
to go around like use me for balance
 

889
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,310
to go around like use me for balance
okay

890
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
okay
 

891
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,890
okay
as she's about to go around and says all

892
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:54,900
as she's about to go around and says all
 

893
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,010
as she's about to go around and says all
light in here this is where I step and I

894
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,020
light in here this is where I step and I
 

895
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,549
light in here this is where I step and I
put my body here

896
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559

 

897
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,730

by doing the issue go 10 conversion

898
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:04,740
by doing the issue go 10 conversion
 

899
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,669
by doing the issue go 10 conversion
boom this is where my body goes

900
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:10,679

 

901
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,990

so

902
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
so
 

903
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,390
so
the reference point

904
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
the reference point
 

905
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,970
the reference point
is an X

906
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:16,980
is an X
 

907
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,590
is an X
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating

908
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating
 

909
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,750
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating
the shape is spiraling but in there is

910
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:26,760
the shape is spiraling but in there is
 

911
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,490
the shape is spiraling but in there is
an idiomi

912
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,500
an idiomi
 

913
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,090
an idiomi
and the reference point is going to be

914
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,100
and the reference point is going to be
 

915
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,549
and the reference point is going to be
like an X shape so as she's coming

916
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
like an X shape so as she's coming
 

917
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:42,110
like an X shape so as she's coming
around I go this way but she goes out

918
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,120

 

919
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,710

this is different from uh a parallel

920
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,720
this is different from uh a parallel
 

921
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,789
this is different from uh a parallel
shape

922
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
shape
 

923
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,250
shape
with parallel to each other

924
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,260

 

925
00:23:52,260 --> 00:24:03,890

boom and I go this way

926
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:03,900

 

927
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,630

the x pattern

928
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:05,640
the x pattern
 

929
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,570
the x pattern
when you do the x pattern

930
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:08,580
when you do the x pattern
 

931
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,990
when you do the x pattern
the next shape I would like you to keep

932
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
the next shape I would like you to keep
 

933
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,510
the next shape I would like you to keep
is that your back foot

934
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:14,520
is that your back foot
 

935
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,110
is that your back foot
does not float

936
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120
does not float
 

937
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,230
does not float
because you're rotating with her and

938
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,240
because you're rotating with her and
 

939
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,789
because you're rotating with her and
you're going to lose your throwing

940
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
you're going to lose your throwing
 

941
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,270
you're going to lose your throwing
geometry

942
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,280

 

943
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,669

and again that doesn't change whether

944
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
and again that doesn't change whether
 

945
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:35,270
and again that doesn't change whether
you'll hear like this

946
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,280

 

947
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,190

so my back foot is gonna remain still

948
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,200
so my back foot is gonna remain still
 

949
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,010
so my back foot is gonna remain still
back foot remains still boom

950
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,020

 

951
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,010

I've never I'm not accelerating them so

952
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,020
I've never I'm not accelerating them so
 

953
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,370
I've never I'm not accelerating them so
I don't need a little extra

954
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:55,380
I don't need a little extra
 

955
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,210
I don't need a little extra
um

956
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,220
um
 

957
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,789
um
inertia forward

958
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
inertia forward
 

959
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,370
inertia forward
so on this one I come this way you have

960
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,380
so on this one I come this way you have
 

961
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,730
so on this one I come this way you have
a a lot of having to put weight on that

962
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:04,740
a a lot of having to put weight on that
 

963
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,890
a a lot of having to put weight on that
front foot it unweights the back foot

964
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:06,900
front foot it unweights the back foot
 

965
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,130
front foot it unweights the back foot
and it starts to float on you

966
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,140
and it starts to float on you
 

967
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,710
and it starts to float on you
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a

968
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a
 

969
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,649
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a
triangle in the middle of her Circle and

970
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:15,659
triangle in the middle of her Circle and
 

971
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,230
triangle in the middle of her Circle and
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her

972
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her
 

973
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,850
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her
body so one two

974
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:25,860

 

975
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,669

so two things on the foot shape or the

976
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:28,679
so two things on the foot shape or the
 

977
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,289
so two things on the foot shape or the
the legwork

978
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:30,299
the legwork
 

979
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,990
the legwork
the footwork there's an x pattern to

980
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,000
the footwork there's an x pattern to
 

981
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,250
the footwork there's an x pattern to
your throat

982
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,260
your throat
 

983
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,490
your throat
she goes on the circle edimi goes across

984
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:37,500
she goes on the circle edimi goes across
 

985
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,630
she goes on the circle edimi goes across
the circle

986
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
the circle
 

987
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,990
the circle
and then secondly your back foot does

988
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
and then secondly your back foot does
 

989
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,630
and then secondly your back foot does
not float okay

990
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640

 

991
00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:10,810

foreign

992
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:10,820

 

993
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,029

so again these are

994
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:14,039
so again these are
 

995
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,390
so again these are
intro shapes you need you want these

996
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:17,400
intro shapes you need you want these
 

997
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,330
intro shapes you need you want these
shapes you need to make problems of

998
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:20,340
shapes you need to make problems of
 

999
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,909
shapes you need to make problems of
these shapes keep those shapes and not

1000
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:22,919
these shapes keep those shapes and not
 

1001
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,130
these shapes keep those shapes and not
worry about what you do with them later

1002
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,140
worry about what you do with them later
 

1003
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,649
worry about what you do with them later
what you do with them

1004
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:30,659
what you do with them
 

1005
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,590
what you do with them
is ultimately what all those podcasts

1006
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
is ultimately what all those podcasts
 

1007
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,810
is ultimately what all those podcasts
are talking about okay

1008
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:35,820
are talking about okay
 

1009
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,310
are talking about okay
these are the shapes

1010
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,320
these are the shapes
 

1011
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,070
these are the shapes
that generate

1012
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
that generate
 

1013
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,070
that generate
the energy

1014
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080

 

1015
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,370

stimulations or requirements necessary

1016
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:49,380
stimulations or requirements necessary
 

1017
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,090
stimulations or requirements necessary
for accessing the god mind

1018
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,100
for accessing the god mind
 

1019
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,450
for accessing the god mind
you're going to also do things with

1020
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:56,460
you're going to also do things with
 

1021
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,930
you're going to also do things with
these as you progress mechanically in

1022
00:26:59,930 --> 00:26:59,940
these as you progress mechanically in
 

1023
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,789
these as you progress mechanically in
your kihonawaza so for example uh

1024
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:03,799
your kihonawaza so for example uh
 

1025
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,289
your kihonawaza so for example uh
tasking yourself with the back foot

1026
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:06,299
tasking yourself with the back foot
 

1027
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,470
tasking yourself with the back foot
being grounded is going to require you

1028
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,480
being grounded is going to require you
 

1029
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,570
being grounded is going to require you
to shift your weight in a much different

1030
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
to shift your weight in a much different
 

1031
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,930
to shift your weight in a much different
way than you would if you can float your

1032
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:14,940
way than you would if you can float your
 

1033
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,549
way than you would if you can float your
back foot

1034
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
back foot
 

1035
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,430
back foot
but with your back foot grounded then

1036
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
but with your back foot grounded then
 

1037
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,950
but with your back foot grounded then
and only then can you start to gain

1038
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:21,960
and only then can you start to gain
 

1039
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,669
and only then can you start to gain
access to the internal aspects uh where

1040
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
access to the internal aspects uh where
 

1041
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,950
access to the internal aspects uh where
you're more coke you projecting them

1042
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
you're more coke you projecting them
 

1043
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,590
you're more coke you projecting them
than you are accelerating them there's

1044
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,600
than you are accelerating them there's
 

1045
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,470
than you are accelerating them there's
no acceleration in Aikido nagawaza

1046
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:33,480

that's not a beginner application of

that's not a beginner application of
 

1061
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,950
that's not a beginner application of
kihonawaza so that's why it's not in

1062
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
kihonawaza so that's why it's not in
