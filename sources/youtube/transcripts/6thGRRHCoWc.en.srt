00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,750

so there's different obstacles for

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
so there's different obstacles for
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,829
so there's different obstacles for
different things

4
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
different things
 

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,509
different things
i want to reach mark

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519

 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,870

he's got me now i'm sort of hanging on

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
he's got me now i'm sort of hanging on
 

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,470
he's got me now i'm sort of hanging on
here now i've got to get mass right i've

10
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
here now i've got to get mass right i've
 

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,190
here now i've got to get mass right i've
got mass

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
got mass
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,870
got mass
oh i've not projected him anymore

14
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
oh i've not projected him anymore
 

15
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,710
oh i've not projected him anymore
knowing i'll get mass

16
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
knowing i'll get mass
 

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,310
knowing i'll get mass
well now i'm not projecting anymore

18
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
well now i'm not projecting anymore
 

19
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,390
well now i'm not projecting anymore
decide one or the other suburbs

20
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
decide one or the other suburbs
 

21
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,990
decide one or the other suburbs
punch him and that was a suburbia

22
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
punch him and that was a suburbia
 

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,069
punch him and that was a suburbia
but when doing taboo you learn mass

24
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079

 

25
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,590

you learn that you learn stability

26
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
you learn that you learn stability
 

27
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,950
you learn that you learn stability
if you do that in a carter it becomes

28
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
if you do that in a carter it becomes
 

29
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,310
if you do that in a carter it becomes
 knee

30
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
knee
 

31
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,350
knee
sun oh i need a breath right

32
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
sun oh i need a breath right
 

33
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,750
sun oh i need a breath right
so that's not a carter the carter is a

34
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
so that's not a carter the carter is a
 

35
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,189
so that's not a carter the carter is a
free-flowing move

36
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
free-flowing move
 

37
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,670
free-flowing move
so so what i'm trying to get you to do

38
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
so so what i'm trying to get you to do
 

39
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,029
so so what i'm trying to get you to do
and you're doing stages

40
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
and you're doing stages
 

41
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,910
and you're doing stages
is if you can couple up the first one i

42
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
is if you can couple up the first one i
 

43
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,230
is if you can couple up the first one i
don't like this sort of thing

44
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
don't like this sort of thing
 

45
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,789
don't like this sort of thing
but if you can couple up just before the

46
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
but if you can couple up just before the
 

47
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,550
but if you can couple up just before the
end of that it

48
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
end of that it
 

49
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,469
end of that it
flowed into another one

50
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479

 

51
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,149

this would be a card

52
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159

 

53
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,310

the problem is the teachers who

54
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
the problem is the teachers who
 

55
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,030
the problem is the teachers who
demonstrate that there's a lot of them

56
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
demonstrate that there's a lot of them
 

57
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,070
demonstrate that there's a lot of them
they don't actually end the move

58
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
they don't actually end the move
 

59
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,230
they don't actually end the move
it becomes like

60
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240

 

61
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,630

it becomes a very shortened version of

62
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
it becomes a very shortened version of
 

63
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,670
it becomes a very shortened version of
what you're supposed to be doing

64
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
what you're supposed to be doing
 

65
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,149
what you're supposed to be doing
what i was showing you what i'm hoping

66
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
what i was showing you what i'm hoping
 

67
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,469
what i was showing you what i'm hoping
what you'll absorb and take away

68
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
what you'll absorb and take away
 

69
00:01:44,479 --> 00:02:02,069
what you'll absorb and take away
and in one day get it is the expansion

70
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079

 

71
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,830

these are all individuals these are all

72
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
these are all individuals these are all
 

73
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,110
these are all individuals these are all
individuals

74
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120

 

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,630

see individual

76
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
see individual
 

77
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:26,949
see individual
this is keeping my energy expansion

78
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959

 

79
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:36,790

but it's doing the fall

80
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
but it's doing the fall
 

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,070
but it's doing the fall
okay it's really difficult of course it

82
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
okay it's really difficult of course it
 

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,270
okay it's really difficult of course it
is

84
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
is
 

85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,509
is
nearly 50 years i'm just discovering

86
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
nearly 50 years i'm just discovering
 

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,630
nearly 50 years i'm just discovering
this

88
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
this
 

89
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,190
this
if i can give it to you earlier what a

90
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
if i can give it to you earlier what a
 

91
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,550
if i can give it to you earlier what a
bonus it is for

92
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
bonus it is for
 

93
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,790
bonus it is for
me to have the joy of watching you get

94
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
me to have the joy of watching you get
 

95
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,589
me to have the joy of watching you get
here

96
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
here
 

97
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,710
here
and you thinking oh i wish i'd read this

98
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,720

 

99
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
