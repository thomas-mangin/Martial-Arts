1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,150

so this is Topsy turby and in order to

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
so this is Topsy turby and in order to
 

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,030
so this is Topsy turby and in order to
get a topsy turby effect that's

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
get a topsy turby effect that's
 

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,390
get a topsy turby effect that's
mechanically efficient I have to

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,400
mechanically efficient I have to
 

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,549
mechanically efficient I have to
establish a relationship between one end

8
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
establish a relationship between one end
 

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,109
establish a relationship between one end
of the lever and the other end of the

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:16,119
of the lever and the other end of the
 

11
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,150
of the lever and the other end of the
lever the two distal ends of the lever

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
lever the two distal ends of the lever
 

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,509
lever the two distal ends of the lever
you do that by establishing the center

14
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,519
you do that by establishing the center
 

15
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,710
you do that by establishing the center
and then you manipulate those distal

16
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
and then you manipulate those distal
 

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,790
and then you manipulate those distal
ends of the lever as far as possible in

18
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
ends of the lever as far as possible in
 

19
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,310
ends of the lever as far as possible in
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,470
the Topsy turbia effect so that's one
thing and then the other thing is you're

22
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
thing and then the other thing is you're
 

23
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,470
thing and then the other thing is you're
going to maintain connection with him so

24
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
going to maintain connection with him so
 

25
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,350
going to maintain connection with him so
that his weight will pull you over okay

26
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
that his weight will pull you over okay
 

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,510
that his weight will pull you over okay
and that's an adhesion all right so you

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
and that's an adhesion all right so you
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,709
and that's an adhesion all right so you
get you know you have to

30
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:41,719
get you know you have to
 

31
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,470
get you know you have to
depost

32
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,480
depost
 

33
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,510
depost
okay and here's one side of the lever up

34
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
okay and here's one side of the lever up
 

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,029
okay and here's one side of the lever up
here at the head and down here at this

36
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
here at the head and down here at this
 

37
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,389
here at the head and down here at this
foot okay and then the other side of the

38
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:53,399
foot okay and then the other side of the
 

39
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,430
foot okay and then the other side of the
lever is here but if I try to do this

40
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,440
lever is here but if I try to do this
 

41
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,670
lever is here but if I try to do this
his Center is kind of gooy what I want

42
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
his Center is kind of gooy what I want
 

43
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,950
his Center is kind of gooy what I want
to do is bring him on to me that makes I

44
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
to do is bring him on to me that makes I
 

45
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,750
to do is bring him on to me that makes I
don't know why but people tense okay and

46
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
don't know why but people tense okay and
 

47
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,670
don't know why but people tense okay and
they tense just enough and I've taken

48
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,680
they tense just enough and I've taken
 

49
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,710
they tense just enough and I've taken
weight off of there but if he was like

50
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
weight off of there but if he was like
 

51
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,789
weight off of there but if he was like
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel

52
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel
 

53
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,670
super Slinky Slinky then you'll feel
like ah man that's heavy again okay so

54
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
like ah man that's heavy again okay so
 

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,469
like ah man that's heavy again okay so
it's more than there's just weight off

56
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
it's more than there's just weight off
 

57
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,590
it's more than there's just weight off
his knees okay you want you as you move

58
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600
his knees okay you want you as you move
 

59
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,030
his knees okay you want you as you move
people will stiffen up and now now this

60
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,040
people will stiffen up and now now this
 

61
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,149
people will stiffen up and now now this
works okay and then I maintain

62
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,159
works okay and then I maintain
 

63
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,830
works okay and then I maintain
connection so I do my scissors sweep and

64
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
connection so I do my scissors sweep and
 

65
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,830
connection so I do my scissors sweep and
as he goes over just whever I'm touching

66
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840
as he goes over just whever I'm touching
 

67
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,950
as he goes over just whever I'm touching
without locking up his

68
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
without locking up his
 

69
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:56,870
without locking up his
weight will pull me

70
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880

 

71
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,389

over okay let's try it is very

72
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:01,399
over okay let's try it is very
 

73
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,350
over okay let's try it is very
tempting to uh go just do a like a a a

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
tempting to uh go just do a like a a a
 

75
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,589
tempting to uh go just do a like a a a
cap on this and then you push him over

76
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:10,599
cap on this and then you push him over
 

77
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,790
cap on this and then you push him over
with

with
 

79
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,630
with
that okay then but we want to work both

80
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
that okay then but we want to work both
 

81
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,830
that okay then but we want to work both
ends of the lever so I'm going to move

82
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:18,840
ends of the lever so I'm going to move
 

83
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,070
ends of the lever so I'm going to move
this it's going all the way over

84
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080

 

85
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,390

there even if I smell that he's

86
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
there even if I smell that he's
 

87
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:41,190
there even if I smell that he's
going I still still do it all the

88
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200

 

89
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,750

way

90
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:42,760
way
 

91
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,990
way
okay don't get

92
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,000
okay don't get
 

93
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,710
okay don't get
lazy that's

94
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
lazy that's
 

95
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,309
lazy that's
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm

96
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm
 

97
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,030
got so even even as I'm holding him I'm
in that connection with him okay so as

98
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
in that connection with him okay so as
 

99
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,390
in that connection with him okay so as
he some people go one leg at a time they

100
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
he some people go one leg at a time they
 

101
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,790
he some people go one leg at a time they
start to stand you see I don't want to

102
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
start to stand you see I don't want to
 

103
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,509
start to stand you see I don't want to
contest this movement I'll I'll fall

104
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
contest this movement I'll I'll fall
 

105
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,789
contest this movement I'll I'll fall
into where I need to go and that's where

106
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:06,799
into where I need to go and that's where
 

107
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,830
into where I need to go and that's where
you're going to find the scissors sweep

108
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:08,840
you're going to find the scissors sweep
 

109
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,949
you're going to find the scissors sweep
okay and then you can

110
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
okay and then you can
 

111
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,670
okay and then you can
see if because you want to move the

112
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
see if because you want to move the
 

113
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,470
see if because you want to move the
distal ends as much as possible you have

114
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,480
distal ends as much as possible you have
 

115
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,670
distal ends as much as possible you have
to get to the distal end don't short

116
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
to get to the distal end don't short
 

117
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,509
to get to the distal end don't short
change it in here you were you stayed

118
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
change it in here you were you stayed
 

119
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,789
change it in here you were you stayed
attached to that point Let It Drop and

120
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
attached to that point Let It Drop and
 

121
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,149
attached to that point Let It Drop and
then you can see how much he's ready to

122
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
then you can see how much he's ready to
 

123
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,149
then you can see how much he's ready to
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't

124
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't
 

125
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,229
fall this way okay yes sir so doesn't
take as much as the administrative

126
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
take as much as the administrative
 

127
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,270
take as much as the administrative
version to get these relationships and

128
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
version to get these relationships and
 

129
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,630
version to get these relationships and
now you just do the same scissors sweep

130
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
now you just do the same scissors sweep
 

131
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,190
now you just do the same scissors sweep
stay

132
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200

 

133
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,869

connected so you you maintain connection

134
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
connected so you you maintain connection
 

135
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,070
connected so you you maintain connection
he goes it's going to move you it moves

let's get
 

165
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,469
let's get
there okay once you grab his neck he he

166
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
there okay once you grab his neck he he
 

167
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,150
there okay once you grab his neck he he
he's going to feel that precariousness

168
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,160
he's going to feel that precariousness
 

169
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,710
he's going to feel that precariousness
so as he goes up you don't want to hold

170
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,720
so as he goes up you don't want to hold
 

171
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,550
so as he goes up you don't want to hold
here you don't want to clench down on

172
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:49,560
here you don't want to clench down on
 

173
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,070
here you don't want to clench down on
that as he goes up you taking it that

174
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
that as he goes up you taking it that
 

175
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,629
that as he goes up you taking it that
way okay just

176
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
way okay just
 

177
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,710
way okay just
like uh when he gets up here you know I

178
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
like uh when he gets up here you know I
 

179
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,510
like uh when he gets up here you know I
don't try to shove it down I bring It

180
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,520
don't try to shove it down I bring It
 

181
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,430
don't try to shove it down I bring It
Forward same exact

182
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,440

 

183
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,830

thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm

184
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:10,840
thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm
 

185
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,510
thing I'm I'm light wherever I'm
touching

186
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520

 

187
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,629

him light he tries to get up I'm

188
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
him light he tries to get up I'm
 

189
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,350
him light he tries to get up I'm
bringing it

190
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
bringing it
 

191
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,510
bringing it
Forward okay otherwise you got to be

192
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,520
Forward okay otherwise you got to be
 

193
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,390
Forward okay otherwise you got to be
stronger than okay here we

194
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,400
stronger than okay here we
 

195
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,990
stronger than okay here we
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you

196
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you
 

197
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,350
go back to admin pendulum sweep okay you
got a couple choices you can either go

198
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,360
got a couple choices you can either go
 

199
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,670
got a couple choices you can either go
on the hip you can go on the

200
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:32,680
on the hip you can go on the
 

201
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,870
on the hip you can go on the
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°

202
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°
 

203
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,670
leg but you're going to try to turn 90°
to

204
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
to
 

205
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,510
to
him you can use your arm to come in okay

206
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
him you can use your arm to come in okay
 

207
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,070
him you can use your arm to come in okay
and what you want is this knee in the

208
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
and what you want is this knee in the
 

209
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,390
and what you want is this knee in the
armpit so keep your locks in there but

210
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
armpit so keep your locks in there but
 

211
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,270
armpit so keep your locks in there but
here's the part you do have to have that

212
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,280
here's the part you do have to have that
 

213
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,150
here's the part you do have to have that
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out

214
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out
 

215
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,270
arm in there okay so he doesn't post out
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's

216
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's
 

217
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,029
the bottom leg keeps straight cuz it's
going to attack the distal end of the

218
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:00,039
going to attack the distal end of the
 

219
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,590
going to attack the distal end of the
pendulum at the

220
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,600
pendulum at the
 

221
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,189
pendulum at the
bottom at the

222
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
bottom at the
 

223
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,070
bottom at the
end and you'll come

224
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

 

225
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,749

over keep this leg straight so you don't

226
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
over keep this leg straight so you don't
 

227
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,909
over keep this leg straight so you don't
make him land on you so

228
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:18,919

 

229
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,589

boom again bring him on you then start

230
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:22,599
boom again bring him on you then start
 

231
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,830
boom again bring him on you then start
to sweep you can keep this long this leg

232
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:26,840
to sweep you can keep this long this leg
 

233
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,990
to sweep you can keep this long this leg
so you get a good base and when you're

234
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,000
so you get a good base and when you're
 

235
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,189
so you get a good base and when you're
ready

236
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,199
ready
 

237
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,469
ready
then you take it

238
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479

 

239
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,469

out stay connected so when the center of

240
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
out stay connected so when the center of
 

241
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,270
out stay connected so when the center of
gravity moves it moves you

242
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,280

 

243
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,749

too okay let's try

244
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
too okay let's try
 

245
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,909
too okay let's try
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do

246
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do
 

247
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,110
sir okay so any Topsy Turvy that you do
in a single plane so in the vertical

248
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
in a single plane so in the vertical
 

249
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,550
in a single plane so in the vertical
plane that as much mechanical advantage

250
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
plane that as much mechanical advantage
 

251
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,189
plane that as much mechanical advantage
as you have by working in the distal

252
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:00,199
as you have by working in the distal
 

253
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,070
as you have by working in the distal
ends of the lever that still requires a

254
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,080
ends of the lever that still requires a
 

255
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,469
ends of the lever that still requires a
great deal of energy if you make this

256
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
great deal of energy if you make this
 

257
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,469
great deal of energy if you make this
Topsy Turvy thing travel across the mat

258
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
Topsy Turvy thing travel across the mat
 

259
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,950
Topsy Turvy thing travel across the mat
in the sagittal plane it takes less

260
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
in the sagittal plane it takes less
 

261
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,830
in the sagittal plane it takes less
energy okay so we were doing that in the

262
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
energy okay so we were doing that in the
 

263
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,909
energy okay so we were doing that in the
other one if you posts up here and when

264
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:18,919
other one if you posts up here and when
 

265
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,350
other one if you posts up here and when
I brought him this way you see he's

266
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,360
I brought him this way you see he's
 

267
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,629
I brought him this way you see he's
traversing if he stays here and I try to

268
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:25,639
traversing if he stays here and I try to
 

269
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,070
traversing if he stays here and I try to
flip this it's doable but that takes way

270
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,080
flip this it's doable but that takes way
 

271
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,589
flip this it's doable but that takes way
more energy than if I'm bringing it this

272
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
more energy than if I'm bringing it this
 

273
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,510
more energy than if I'm bringing it this
way then it's effortless okay so the

274
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:36,520
way then it's effortless okay so the
 

275
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,790
way then it's effortless okay so the
more ples you add especially the

276
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
more ples you add especially the
 

277
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,950
more ples you add especially the
sagittal one the less energy it takes to

278
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:41,960
sagittal one the less energy it takes to
 

279
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,469
sagittal one the less energy it takes to
make the two distal ends trade places

280
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
make the two distal ends trade places
 

281
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,830
make the two distal ends trade places
all right so same thing here when you

282
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
all right so same thing here when you
 

283
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,749
all right so same thing here when you
come around here you don't you want to

284
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
come around here you don't you want to
 

285
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,189
come around here you don't you want to
make him Traverse okay so this leg is

286
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
make him Traverse okay so this leg is
 

287
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,350
make him Traverse okay so this leg is
I'm going to game this leg this leg is

288
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
I'm going to game this leg this leg is
 

289
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,550
I'm going to game this leg this leg is
actually bringing him this way

290
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560

 

291
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,390

when you add the arm and the hook and

292
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
when you add the arm and the hook and
 

293
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,110
when you add the arm and the hook and
everything it's much easier I'm going to

294
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,120
everything it's much easier I'm going to
 

295
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,070
everything it's much easier I'm going to
bring him this way you

296
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,080
bring him this way you
 

297
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,149
bring him this way you
see not this

298
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:14,159
see not this
 

299
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,110
see not this
way so bring him on you and he goes this

300
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
way so bring him on you and he goes this
 

301
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,070
way so bring him on you and he goes this
way much

302
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,080
way much
 

303
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,029
way much
easier

304
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
easier
 

305
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,390
easier
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again

306
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again
 

307
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,749
Okay add that sagittal plan try it again
in all your techniques right so find

308
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:28,759
in all your techniques right so find
 

309
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,589
in all your techniques right so find
doing EO uh and he's going to try to

310
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
doing EO uh and he's going to try to
 

311
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,630
doing EO uh and he's going to try to
resist up it's not that I drop on him

312
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
resist up it's not that I drop on him
 

313
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,550
resist up it's not that I drop on him
and try to take him down okay the energy

314
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
and try to take him down okay the energy
 

315
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,949
and try to take him down okay the energy
that he resists going up I take

316
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:39,959
that he resists going up I take
 

317
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,589
that he resists going up I take
forward okay every every technique's

318
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:42,599
forward okay every every technique's
 

319
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,190
forward okay every every technique's
like that so this is no

320
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200

 

321
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,030

different okay so a guy is trying to get

322
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,040
different okay so a guy is trying to get
 

323
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,990
different okay so a guy is trying to get
up a lot of people shoot you should get

324
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
up a lot of people shoot you should get
 

325
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,110
up a lot of people shoot you should get
up you shouldn't stay down there's no

326
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,120
up you shouldn't stay down there's no
 

327
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,389
up you shouldn't stay down there's no

up you're going to look for the

342
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,120
up you're going to look for the
 

343
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,670
up you're going to look for the
precariousness that comes from

344
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,680
precariousness that comes from
 

345
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,150
precariousness that comes from
transitioning from his knee to his foot

346
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,160
transitioning from his knee to his foot
 

347
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,670
transitioning from his knee to his foot
okay that's what I'm looking for and

348
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
okay that's what I'm looking for and
 

349
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,030
okay that's what I'm looking for and
when I take that precariousness I'm not

350
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,040
when I take that precariousness I'm not
 

351
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,870
when I take that precariousness I'm not
trying to hold it down

352

trying to hold it down
 

353
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,509
trying to hold it down
as he goes to stand up this motion is

354
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:32,519
as he goes to stand up this motion is
 

355
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,710
as he goes to stand up this motion is
going forward on the neck and then the

356
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:35,720
going forward on the neck and then the
 

357
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,230
going forward on the neck and then the
knee pull is going forward okay and as

358
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
knee pull is going forward okay and as
 

359
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,150
knee pull is going forward okay and as
he starts to go up I'm going to take him

360
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
he starts to go up I'm going to take him
 

361
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,190
he starts to go up I'm going to take him
to the

362
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
to the
 

363
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,949
to the
side so that I get the side scissor get

364
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
side so that I get the side scissor get
 

365
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,030
side so that I get the side scissor get
my elbow Out start climbing on the back

366
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,040
my elbow Out start climbing on the back
 

367
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,069
my elbow Out start climbing on the back
he's not going to let me do that he's

368
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:52,079
he's not going to let me do that he's
 

369
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,750
he's not going to let me do that he's
going to try to get his head up and

going to try to get his head up and
 

371
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,630
going to try to get his head up and
start pushing back and now here

00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
start pushing back and now here
 

373
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,430
start pushing back and now here
is your pendulum sweep

374
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440

 

375
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,190

again don't contest anything directly he
goes one there it is Boom up here he

378
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
goes one there it is Boom up here he
 

379
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,949
goes one there it is Boom up here he
comes

380
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:13,959
comes
 

381
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,670
comes
Bo

382
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680

 

383
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,760

pendulum okay try it again
