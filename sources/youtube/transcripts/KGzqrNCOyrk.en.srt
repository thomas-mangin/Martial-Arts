in it that way you might get better
 

27
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:31,900
in it that way you might get better
jiu-jitsu that way but you're not gonna

28

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:35,630
use a different set of skills so we have
 

33
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,090
use a different set of skills so we have
to find ways to introduce live

34
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,100
to find ways to introduce live

skills were trying to acquire are gonna
 

41
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,860
skills were trying to acquire are gonna
be distancing clearing how to keep

42
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:47,870
be distancing clearing how to keep
 

43
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,329
be distancing clearing how to keep
suppression in all these kinds of things

44
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:49,339
suppression in all these kinds of things
 

45
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:51,310
suppression in all these kinds of things
these are the kinds of skills we need so

46
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,320
these are the kinds of skills we need so
 

47
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,169
these are the kinds of skills we need so
we're gonna outline a really simple

48
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:53,179
we're gonna outline a really simple
 

49
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,209
we're gonna outline a really simple
drill here that we go from a to Zed here

50
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:55,219
drill here that we go from a to Zed here
 

51
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,540
drill here that we go from a to Zed here
and we'll kind of see how we can build

52
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:58,550
and we'll kind of see how we can build
 

53
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,819
and we'll kind of see how we can build
this practice up so the first thing is

54
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:00,829
this practice up so the first thing is
 

55
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,770
this practice up so the first thing is
Josh of course should be trying to keep

56
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:02,780
Josh of course should be trying to keep
 

57
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,990
Josh of course should be trying to keep
distance from Maya right so if Maya was

58
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,000
distance from Maya right so if Maya was
 

59
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,610
distance from Maya right so if Maya was
attacking Josh Josh always wants to keep

60
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:06,620
attacking Josh Josh always wants to keep
 

61
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,410
attacking Josh Josh always wants to keep
distance and that's the idea so he's

62
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:08,420
distance and that's the idea so he's
 

63
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,850
distance and that's the idea so he's
trying to stay away from her we don't

64
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:09,860
trying to stay away from her we don't
 

65
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,290
trying to stay away from her we don't
have enough room right now to make that

66
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:11,300
have enough room right now to make that
 

67
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,670
have enough room right now to make that
work so we're not gonna worry about that

68
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:12,680
work so we're not gonna worry about that
 

69
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,290
work so we're not gonna worry about that
drill although that is a drill we need

70
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:14,300
drill although that is a drill we need
 

71
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,090
drill although that is a drill we need
to work on which is a distancing drill

72
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,100
to work on which is a distancing drill
 

73
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,700
to work on which is a distancing drill
but if Maya is able to get closer to

74
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:18,710
but if Maya is able to get closer to
 

75
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,770
but if Maya is able to get closer to
Josh - Josh would like he's got to learn

76
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:20,780
Josh - Josh would like he's got to learn
 

77
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,240
Josh - Josh would like he's got to learn
to deal with that now she could get

78
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,250
to deal with that now she could get
 

79
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,800
to deal with that now she could get
closer to him because a she's just

80

closer to him because a she's just
 

81
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,050
closer to him because a she's just
faster than him - too fast Josh can't

82
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,060
faster than him - too fast Josh can't

185
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,810
perfect now let's we have okay who's
doing that we can start to get some more

186
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:09,820
doing that we can start to get some more
 

187
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,100
doing that we can start to get some more
realistic responses

188
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,110
realistic responses
 

189
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,740

now if Mile is actually attacking Josh

190
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,750
now if Mile is actually attacking Josh
 

191
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,140
now if Mile is actually attacking Josh
and Josh just get off the line it could

192
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,150
and Josh just get off the line it could
 

193
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,949
and Josh just get off the line it could
look like this

194
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
look like this
 

195
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,479
look like this
and now we have Josh being a perfect

196
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:18,489
and now we have Josh being a perfect
 

197
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,490
and now we have Josh being a perfect
split-second decision to enable that to

198
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:20,500
split-second decision to enable that to
 

199
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,560
split-second decision to enable that to
happen but more likely Maya's gonna

200
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,570
happen but more likely Maya's gonna
 

201
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,050
happen but more likely Maya's gonna
adapt when Josh adapt so when josh

202
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,060
adapt when Josh adapt so when josh
 

203
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,820
adapt when Josh adapt so when josh
adapts Kamiya minds gonna adapt to jump

204
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:26,830

right so he got off the line but Maya

206
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,410
right so he got off the line but Maya
 

207
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,050
right so he got off the line but Maya
was still able to come in to push him

208
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,060
was still able to come in to push him
 

209
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,000
was still able to come in to push him
because she was a had enough time that

210
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,010
because she was a had enough time that
 

211
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,229
because she was a had enough time that
she could see what he was doing

212
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
she could see what he was doing
 

213
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,759
she could see what he was doing
so what josh tries to do is get

214
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:35,769
so what josh tries to do is get
 

215
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,680
so what josh tries to do is get
suppression in order to do that so he

216
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:37,690
suppression in order to do that so he
 

217
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,840
suppression in order to do that so he
comes in he gets suppression and that

218
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:39,850
comes in he gets suppression and that
 

219
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,820
comes in he gets suppression and that
keeps her from being able to change the

220
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:41,830
keeps her from being able to change the
 

221
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,729
keeps her from being able to change the
line so the next thing is can the muguet

222
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:44,739
line so the next thing is can the muguet
 

223
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,680
line so the next thing is can the muguet

okay now how do we evolve that practice

228
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:51,700
okay now how do we evolve that practice
 

229
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,970
okay now how do we evolve that practice
further now Maya can attempt to get

230
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:53,980
further now Maya can attempt to get
 

231
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,560
further now Maya can attempt to get
around Josh's suppression so I'm gonna

232
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,570
around Josh's suppression so I'm gonna
 

233
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,180
around Josh's suppression so I'm gonna
go real slow this isn't the speed we're

in josh is gonna suppress and Maya's
 

239
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,750
in josh is gonna suppress and Maya's
gonna go around that suppression so she

240
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
gonna go around that suppression so she
 

241
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,230

in a second when Josh does that josh is
a suppression is gonna have to adapt to

tons away could be a battle the hands

262
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:27,860
tons away could be a battle the hands
 

263
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,350
tons away could be a battle the hands
the hands could go up and down right so
