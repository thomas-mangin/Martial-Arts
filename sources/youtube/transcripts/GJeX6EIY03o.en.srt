you're going here
 

241
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,629
you're going here
and then you're pulling it off

242
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
and then you're pulling it off
 

243
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,189
and then you're pulling it off
um or the pause mistake that you're

244
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
um or the pause mistake that you're
 

245
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,870

making just you can watch more
 

247
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,189
making just you can watch more
in this pause right here this leg is

248
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
in this pause right here this leg is
 

249
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,550
in this pause right here this leg is
going to come in his legs

250
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560

 

251
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,710

um

252
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
um
 

253
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,270
um
reverse what mistakes are being made

254
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
reverse what mistakes are being made
 

255
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,350
reverse what mistakes are being made
before that and you're going to see that

256
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
before that and you're going to see that
 

257
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,230
before that and you're going to see that
you're violating yin and yang

258
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
you're violating yin and yang
 

259
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,869
you're violating yin and yang
reconciliation

260
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
reconciliation
 

261
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,629
reconciliation
so

262
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
so
 

263
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,790
so
he's here

264
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
he's here
 

265
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,029
he's here
and you're pushing

266
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
and you're pushing
 

267
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,790
and you're pushing
there okay

268
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
there okay
 

269
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,230
there okay
which means you're

270
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
which means you're
 

271
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,510
which means you're
you're starting your entry

272
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
you're starting your entry
 

273
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,189
you're starting your entry
uh before he's done coming at you

274
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
uh before he's done coming at you
 

275
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,390
uh before he's done coming at you
okay

276
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
okay
 

277
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,749
okay
so the reverse the equal opposite energy

278
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
so the reverse the equal opposite energy
 

279
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,629
so the reverse the equal opposite energy
is

280
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
is
 

281
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,230
is
stopping you

282
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
stopping you
 

283
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,830
stopping you
you either have to wait till enough of

284
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
you either have to wait till enough of
 

285
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,110
you either have to wait till enough of
it comes off

286
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
it comes off
 

287
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,270
it comes off
or you have to i'm trying to get it out

288
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
or you have to i'm trying to get it out
 

289
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,390
or you have to i'm trying to get it out
of the way

290
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
of the way
 

291
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,070
of the way
now

292
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
now
 

293
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,469
now
so if we go to uh

294
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
so if we go to uh
 

295
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,949
so if we go to uh
just katakta so you could see it

296
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
just katakta so you could see it
 

297
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,070
just katakta so you could see it
it's he's charging we have yoyo here

298
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
it's he's charging we have yoyo here
 

299
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,190
it's he's charging we have yoyo here
he's charging it and that's what i used

300
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
he's charging it and that's what i used
 

301
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,990
he's charging it and that's what i used
to send him flying okay

302
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
to send him flying okay
 

303
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,269
to send him flying okay
uh

304
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
uh
 

305
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,310
uh
so when i actually

306
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
so when i actually
 

307
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,389
so when i actually
give me some energy

308
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
give me some energy
 

309
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,829
give me some energy
boom when i actually enter he he's going

310
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
boom when i actually enter he he's going
 

311
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,949
boom when i actually enter he he's going
that way

312
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
that way
 

313
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,790
that way
i don't enter

314
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
i don't enter
 

315
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,790
i don't enter
to make him go

316
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
to make him go
 

317
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,910
to make him go
that way

318
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
that way
 

319
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,710
that way
that's a yangyang clash i can only enter

320
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
that's a yangyang clash i can only enter
 

321
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,150
that's a yangyang clash i can only enter
where there's in space okay

322
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
where there's in space okay
 

323
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,190
where there's in space okay
so

324
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
so
 

325
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,110
so
when i go

326
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
when i go
 

327
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,389
when i go
boom i'm following the elbow

328
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
boom i'm following the elbow
 

329
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,910
boom i'm following the elbow
that's going that way

330
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920

 

331
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,829

i'm not pushing the

332
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

333
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,630

elbow therefore i can get to the elbow

334
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
elbow therefore i can get to the elbow
 

335
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,790
elbow therefore i can get to the elbow
so he hits one of

336
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
so he hits one of
 

337
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,150
so he hits one of
the elbows

338
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
the elbows
 

339
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,829
the elbows
in

340
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839

 

341
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,509

therefore

342
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
therefore
 

343
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,750
therefore
i don't need to get the hand out of the

344
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
i don't need to get the hand out of the
 

345
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:44,550
i don't need to get the hand out of the
way

346
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560

 

347
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,110

we've done this a million times but you

348
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
we've done this a million times but you
 

349
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,790
we've done this a million times but you
can see

350
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
can see
 

351
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,620
can see
push almost pushing on me

352
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:50,630
push almost pushing on me
 

353
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,230
