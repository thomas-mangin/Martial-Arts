1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,990

so uh let's just start here at first

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
so uh let's just start here at first
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,789
so uh let's just start here at first
okay let's get a strategy I'm seeing

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
okay let's get a strategy I'm seeing
 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,390
okay let's get a strategy I'm seeing
we're working on on uh placement so

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
we're working on on uh placement so
 

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,870
we're working on on uh placement so
pressure is a one strategy but I I tend

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
pressure is a one strategy but I I tend
 

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,749
pressure is a one strategy but I I tend
not to like it okay um the strategy I

10
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
not to like it okay um the strategy I
 

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,750
not to like it okay um the strategy I
want you to learn is you you you uh keep

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:18,760
want you to learn is you you you uh keep
 

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,349
want you to learn is you you you uh keep
the zero pressure so the ike adhesion so

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359
the zero pressure so the ike adhesion so
 

15
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,630
the zero pressure so the ike adhesion so
for example uh he's trying to bridge to

16
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
for example uh he's trying to bridge to
 

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,269
for example uh he's trying to bridge to
get uh his arm and he's trying go do

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,279
get uh his arm and he's trying go do
 

19
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:36,590
get uh his arm and he's trying go do
that escape hold there we go yeah

20
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600

 

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,950

okay oh you're might be tempted when you

22
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
okay oh you're might be tempted when you
 

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,190
okay oh you're might be tempted when you
feel him go

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
feel him go
 

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,869
feel him go
up you see okay and what I'm going to do

26
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:45,879
up you see okay and what I'm going to do
 

27
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,830
up you see okay and what I'm going to do
is just move with him so he goes up and

28
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
is just move with him so he goes up and
 

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,990
is just move with him so he goes up and
I move with

30
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,000
I move with
 

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,110
I move with
him you see that so uh the the first one

32
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,120
him you see that so uh the the first one
 

33
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,349
him you see that so uh the the first one
he goes and I kind of whoa I'm late you

34
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,359
he goes and I kind of whoa I'm late you
 

35
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,430
he goes and I kind of whoa I'm late you
see I get space so that's negative I'm

36
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
see I get space so that's negative I'm
 

37
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,790
see I get space so that's negative I'm
too Nega

38
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
too Nega
 

39
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,630
too Nega
okay and then the second one he goes to

40
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
okay and then the second one he goes to
 

41
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,229
okay and then the second one he goes to
Bri and I'm trying to hold him and I'm

42
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
Bri and I'm trying to hold him and I'm
 

43

Bri and I'm trying to hold him and I'm
burning out my biceps and things like

44
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,520
burning out my biceps and things like
 

45
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,190
burning out my biceps and things like
that okay so what I'm going to do

46
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
that okay so what I'm going to do
 

47
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,590
that okay so what I'm going to do
instead as he goes to Bridge and tries

48
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
instead as he goes to Bridge and tries
 

49
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,590
instead as he goes to Bridge and tries
to get the arm I just keep the same

50
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
to get the arm I just keep the same
 

51
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,910
to get the arm I just keep the same
neutral space you see how I did that so

52
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
neutral space you see how I did that so
 

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,630
neutral space you see how I did that so
get a good frame that you want okay and

54
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:19,640
get a good frame that you want okay and
 

55
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,510
get a good frame that you want okay and
then he's going to try to get get this

56
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
then he's going to try to get get this
 

57
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,749
then he's going to try to get get this
arm I just move with it you see that Ah

58
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
arm I just move with it you see that Ah
 

59
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,149
arm I just move with it you see that Ah
that's just another iy adhesion just

60
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,159
that's just another iy adhesion just
 

61
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,469
that's just another iy adhesion just
body to body I'm zero pressure I'm not

62
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:31,479
body to body I'm zero pressure I'm not
 

63
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,910
body to body I'm zero pressure I'm not
pushing into him but I'm not yielding to

64
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
pushing into him but I'm not yielding to
 

65
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,469
pushing into him but I'm not yielding to
it uh on a negative side okay all right

66
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
it uh on a negative side okay all right
 

67
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,710
it uh on a negative side okay all right
so we'll we'll practice that at first so

68
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:41,720
so we'll we'll practice that at first so
 

69
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,190
so we'll we'll practice that at first so
he'll do like a really explosive

70
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
he'll do like a really explosive
 

71
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,389
he'll do like a really explosive
bridge and you'll just we'll do it one

72
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
bridge and you'll just we'll do it one
 

73
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,389
bridge and you'll just we'll do it one
more

74
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:49,399
more
 

75
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,830
more
time all right and then we'll let him

76
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
time all right and then we'll let him
 

77
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,429
time all right and then we'll let him
get in he got it okay and I'll now fill

78
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
get in he got it okay and I'll now fill
 

79
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,830
get in he got it okay and I'll now fill
the new y

80
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
the new y
 

81
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,069
the new y
space is around him so he

82
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
space is around him so he
 

83
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,709
space is around him so he
goes and I F the new Yin space you see

84
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:05,719
goes and I F the new Yin space you see
 

85
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,070
goes and I F the new Yin space you see
that okay so he doesn't get to use it to

86
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
that okay so he doesn't get to use it to
 

87
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,869
that okay so he doesn't get to use it to
get on the other Escape okay so so you

88
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:13,879
get on the other Escape okay so so you
 

89
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,110
get on the other Escape okay so so you
pay attention what was the Escape that

90
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,120
pay attention what was the Escape that
 

91
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,790
pay attention what was the Escape that
he did he came here and he went off okay

92
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
he did he came here and he went off okay
 

93
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,830
he did he came here and he went off okay
so we're going to come

94
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840

 

95
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,030

back and he goes and he got it but I F

96
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,040
back and he goes and he got it but I F
 

97
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,150
back and he goes and he got it but I F
this in space here you see and now he's

98
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,160
this in space here you see and now he's
 

99
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,630
this in space here you see and now he's
flat on his back again okay without me

100
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
flat on his back again okay without me
 

101
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,869
flat on his back again okay without me
trying to muscle him okay all right well

102
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
trying to muscle him okay all right well
 

103
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,910
trying to muscle him okay all right well
technically he isolated that arm and I

104
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
technically he isolated that arm and I
 

105
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,270
technically he isolated that arm and I
want to make sure it's isolated so I'm

106
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,280
want to make sure it's isolated so I'm
 

107
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,309
want to make sure it's isolated so I'm
going to take advantage and isolate this

108
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:45,319
going to take advantage and isolate this
 

109
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,110
going to take advantage and isolate this
arm even more okay this arm so I'm going

arm even more okay this arm so I'm going
to come over the top there's any number

112
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
to come over the top there's any number
 

113
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,070
to come over the top there's any number
of ways you want to do it you kind hit

114
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
of ways you want to do it you kind hit
 

115
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,949
of ways you want to do it you kind hit
him as you're coming around and I'm

116
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
him as you're coming around and I'm
 

117
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,550
him as you're coming around and I'm

going to come under and bring his head
 

119
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,949
going to come under and bring his head
up into that seam you see that and then

120
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:01,959
up into that seam you see that and then
 

121
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,110
up into that seam you see that and then
to help it trap even more I'll move my

122
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
to help it trap even more I'll move my
 

123
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,750
to help it trap even more I'll move my
knee under him you see but my goal was

124
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
knee under him you see but my goal was
 

125
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,589
knee under him you see but my goal was
to isolate the arm so what see my pelvis

126
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
to isolate the arm so what see my pelvis
 

127
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,750
to isolate the arm so what see my pelvis
I'm going to drop it I feel it pressing

128
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm going to drop it I feel it pressing
 

129
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,430

131
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,470
on his arm okay and that's what I'm
interested in because this is the arm

interested in because this is the arm
 

133
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,190
interested in because this is the arm
that I want to attack so once once he's

134

that I want to attack so once once he's
there I can always secure over here on

136
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
there I can always secure over here on
 

137
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,630
there I can always secure over here on
the lat you see that because I'm going

138
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:27,640
the lat you see that because I'm going
 

139
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,750
the lat you see that because I'm going
to start attacking this arm so so it's

140
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:30,760
to start attacking this arm so so it's
 

141
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,710
to start attacking this arm so so it's
trapped it's trapped in there because

00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
trapped it's trapped in there because
 

143
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,309
trapped it's trapped in there because
I'm on his tricep tendon of insertion

144
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
I'm on his tricep tendon of insertion
 

145
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,390

149
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,509
can't pull it out and so I'm going to
now attack it I'm going to drop pressure

150
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
now attack it I'm going to drop pressure
 

151
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,229
now attack it I'm going to drop pressure

learned something about

536
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
learned something about
 

537
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,350
learned something about
katam the first one is the the ball in

538
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:00,360
katam the first one is the the ball in
 

539
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,110
katam the first one is the the ball in
socket has to be stabilized that was in

540
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
socket has to be stabilized that was in
 

541
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,230
socket has to be stabilized that was in
the first variant the ball in socket has

542
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240
the first variant the ball in socket has
 

543
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,550
the first variant the ball in socket has
to be stabilized to such a degree that

544
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
to be stabilized to such a degree that
 

545
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,150
to be stabilized to such a degree that
uh I can move everything else and then

546
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,160
uh I can move everything else and then
 

547
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,430
uh I can move everything else and then
once I start seeking stabilization on

548
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
once I start seeking stabilization on
 

549
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,949
once I start seeking stabilization on
the ball in socket when I pinned on the

550
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
the ball in socket when I pinned on the
 

551
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,389
the ball in socket when I pinned on the
mat that's when you felt the first

552
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
mat that's when you felt the first
 

553
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,550
mat that's when you felt the first
technique on the second technique what

554
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
technique on the second technique what
 

555
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,350
technique on the second technique what
you wanted to learn is the wrist and the

556
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
you wanted to learn is the wrist and the
 

557
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,389
you wanted to learn is the wrist and the
elbow uh rotate around each other so I

558
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
elbow uh rotate around each other so I
 

559
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,990
elbow uh rotate around each other so I
can either stabilize the wrist and then

560
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,000
can either stabilize the wrist and then
 

561
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,949
can either stabilize the wrist and then
rotate the elbow to fect the elbow well

562
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
rotate the elbow to fect the elbow well
 

563
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,470
rotate the elbow to fect the elbow well
I can also uh stabilize the elbow and

564
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,480
I can also uh stabilize the elbow and
 

565
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,310
I can also uh stabilize the elbow and
move the wrist around it will still

566
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,320
move the wrist around it will still
 

567
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,790
move the wrist around it will still
affect the elbow okay but right now you

568
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:37,800
affect the elbow okay but right now you
 

569
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,310
affect the elbow okay but right now you
have two different techniques so two

570
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
have two different techniques so two
 

571
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,629
have two different techniques so two
different arms so here you are and

572
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
different arms so here you are and
 

573
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,550
different arms so here you are and
you're trying to do K but his shoulder

574
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
you're trying to do K but his shoulder
 

575
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,910
you're trying to do K but his shoulder
is not pinned to the ground you see that

576
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
is not pinned to the ground you see that
 

577
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,590
is not pinned to the ground you see that
so everything kind of looks good but his

578
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:52,600
so everything kind of looks good but his
 

579
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,350
so everything kind of looks good but his
shoulder is up you see that I I'll keep

580
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360
shoulder is up you see that I I'll keep
 

581
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,509
shoulder is up you see that I I'll keep
everything the same keep it all the same

582
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:58,519
everything the same keep it all the same
 

583
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,310
everything the same keep it all the same
and and I'll start to push the shoulder

584
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,320
and and I'll start to push the shoulder
 

585
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,629
and and I'll start to push the shoulder
down you see and is all

586
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:05,639
down you see and is all
 

587
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,749
down you see and is all
ready leave the shoulder up same

588
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:08,759
ready leave the shoulder up same
 

589
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,829
ready leave the shoulder up same
movement way more range of motion okay

590
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
movement way more range of motion okay
 

591
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,910
movement way more range of motion okay
so first

592
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
so first
 

593
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,030
so first
variation hold around this shoulder has

594
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,040
variation hold around this shoulder has
 

595
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,949
variation hold around this shoulder has
to be down down down down down is down

596
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:25,959
to be down down down down down is down
 

597
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,430
to be down down down down down is down
do you understand and this knee stops it

598
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,440
do you understand and this knee stops it
 

599
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,710
do you understand and this knee stops it
from sliding so I am aiming his shoulder

600
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
from sliding so I am aiming his shoulder
 

601
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,910
from sliding so I am aiming his shoulder
into that corner of my

602
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920
into that corner of my
 

603
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,110
into that corner of my
knee the corner the seam between my knee

604
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,120
knee the corner the seam between my knee
 

605
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,350
knee the corner the seam between my knee
and the mat everything is going down

606
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,360
and the mat everything is going down
 

607
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,350
and the mat everything is going down
into that and once that's down now I

608
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,360
into that and once that's down now I
 

609
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,829
into that and once that's down now I
move his elbow forward towards his ear

610
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
move his elbow forward towards his ear
 

611
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,509
move his elbow forward towards his ear
so so you can open

612
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:52,519
so so you can open
 

613
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,550
so so you can open
it there's where my knee is right there

614
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
it there's where my knee is right there
 

615
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,470
it there's where my knee is right there
there's a seam where his shoulder

616
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,480
there's a seam where his shoulder
 

617
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,389
there's a seam where his shoulder
and the mat and my knee

618
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
and the mat and my knee
 

619
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,030
and the mat and my knee
meet that seam is where I'm driving this

620
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
meet that seam is where I'm driving this
 

621
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,350
meet that seam is where I'm driving this
in do you understand once that's dried

622
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
in do you understand once that's dried
 

623
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,230
in do you understand once that's dried
in then like the other technique this

624
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
in then like the other technique this
 

625
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,069
in then like the other technique this
elbow goes towards his ear down and the

626
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
elbow goes towards his ear down and the
 

627
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,629
elbow goes towards his ear down and the
elbow goes towards his ear and now you

628
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:21,639
elbow goes towards his ear and now you
 

629
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,629
elbow goes towards his ear and now you
get it okay do it again

630
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
get it okay do it again
 

631
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,430
get it okay do it again
one in

632
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
one in
 

633
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,749
one in
to the seam energy is going not there

634
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
to the seam energy is going not there
 

635
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,230
to the seam energy is going not there
into the seam you see into that seam

636
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,240
into the seam you see into that seam
 

637
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,230
into the seam you see into that seam
once I have that seam met then I bring

638
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
once I have that seam met then I bring
 

639
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,189
once I have that seam met then I bring
his elbow to this

640
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
his elbow to this
 

641
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,189
his elbow to this
ear you'll get it if his elbow is up

642
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:48,199
ear you'll get it if his elbow is up
 

643
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:50,829
ear you'll get it if his elbow is up
it's not going to work if your knee is

644
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:50,839
it's not going to work if your knee is
 

645
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,790
it's not going to work if your knee is
too far ahead he'll first move to that

646
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:53,800
too far ahead he'll first move to that
 

647
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,910
too far ahead he'll first move to that
area do you get it that slack okay try

648
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
area do you get it that slack okay try
 

649
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,870
area do you get it that slack okay try
it again

650
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:01,880

 

651
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,909

so has to go

652
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:03,919
so has to go
 

653
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,630
so has to go
down down down into the

654
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
down down down into the
 

655
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,189
down down down into the
seam here I'm making it obvious so you

656
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
seam here I'm making it obvious so you
 

657
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,510
seam here I'm making it obvious so you
can see the trajectory down okay once

658
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:14,520
can see the trajectory down okay once
 

659
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,309
can see the trajectory down okay once
it's down then I push it's down when I

see don't rotate
down and then towards the Z

686
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:03,960
down and then towards the Z
 

687
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,549
down and then towards the Z
okay

688
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:07,559

 

689
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,350

next last in the other technique I

690
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,360
next last in the other technique I
 

691
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,390
next last in the other technique I
stabilize the wrist this time I'm going

692
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
stabilize the wrist this time I'm going
 

693
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,190
stabilize the wrist this time I'm going
to stabilize the elbow so the elbow I'm

694
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
to stabilize the elbow so the elbow I'm
 

695
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,710
to stabilize the elbow so the elbow I'm
going to

696
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
going to
 

697
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,750
going to
stabilize okay and I'm going to attack

698
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:18,760
stabilize okay and I'm going to attack
 

699
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,029
stabilize okay and I'm going to attack
the elbow not going to attack the

700
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:20,039
the elbow not going to attack the
 

701
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,950
the elbow not going to attack the
shoulder I'm going to attack the elbow

702
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:21,960
shoulder I'm going to attack the elbow
 

703
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,909
shoulder I'm going to attack the elbow
so I'm going to stabilize it it's

704
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:24,919
so I'm going to stabilize it it's
 

705
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,630
so I'm going to stabilize it it's
stabilized Bo like a s kill stab ize it

706
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:29,640
stabilized Bo like a s kill stab ize it
 

707
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,710
stabilized Bo like a s kill stab ize it
I could do the same technique so I have

708
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:31,720
I could do the same technique so I have
 

709
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,990
I could do the same technique so I have
S I could pin and then push could what

710
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
S I could pin and then push could what
 

711
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,430
S I could pin and then push could what
I'm going to do this time as I stabilize

712
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm going to do this time as I stabilize
 

713
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,950
I'm going to do this time as I stabilize
it I am going to move the hand around

714
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
it I am going to move the hand around
 

715
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,669
it I am going to move the hand around
the elbow do you see that while I'm not

716
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
the elbow do you see that while I'm not
 

717
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,830
the elbow do you see that while I'm not
rotating cuz then the elbow's not

718
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
rotating cuz then the elbow's not
 

719
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,270
rotating cuz then the elbow's not
stabilized okay so pin pin it in space

720
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280
stabilized okay so pin pin it in space
 

721
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,669
stabilized okay so pin pin it in space
and then I start to take his hand around

722
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:54,679
and then I start to take his hand around
 

723
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:55,510
and then I start to take his hand around
the

724
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
the
 

725
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,390
the
elbow you see that okay so I

726
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
elbow you see that okay so I
 

727
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,830
elbow you see that okay so I
got my

got my
 

729
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,350
got my
technique I go home here and uh any

730
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:08,360
technique I go home here and uh any
 

731
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,470
technique I go home here and uh any
number of reasons I I have to do this

732
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
number of reasons I I have to do this
 

733
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,149
