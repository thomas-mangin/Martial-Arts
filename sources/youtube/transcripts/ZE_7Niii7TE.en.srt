talk about the atimi a the general
 

19
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,670
talk about the atimi a the general
overview video for this so if you start

20
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
overview video for this so if you start
 

21
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,109
overview video for this so if you start
your students off with a weapon in the

22
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
your students off with a weapon in the
 

23
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,509
your students off with a weapon in the
hand it'll make these make a lot more

24
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:28,519
hand it'll make these make a lot more
 

25
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,509
hand it'll make these make a lot more
sense to them really early on these are

26
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:30,519
sense to them really early on these are
 

27
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,190
sense to them really early on these are
primarily weapon strikes could you do

28
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,200
primarily weapon strikes could you do
 

29
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,069
primarily weapon strikes could you do
these with no weapon in your hand sure

30
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
these with no weapon in your hand sure
 

31
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,350
these with no weapon in your hand sure
would they be as valuable or important

32
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
would they be as valuable or important
 

33
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,350
would they be as valuable or important
no they wouldn't so just start with a

34
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,360
no they wouldn't so just start with a
 

35
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,590
no they wouldn't so just start with a
weapon in hand at least then in order to

36
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,600
weapon in hand at least then in order to
 

37
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,670
weapon in hand at least then in order to
keep you from getting bonked with

38
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
keep you from getting bonked with
 

39
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,350
keep you from getting bonked with
weapons or people having no idea how to

40
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
weapons or people having no idea how to
 

41
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,869
weapons or people having no idea how to
handle the weapons you can take them out

42
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
handle the weapons you can take them out
 

43
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,229
handle the weapons you can take them out
for a while so let's talk about the

44
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:47,239
for a while so let's talk about the
 

45
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,869
for a while so let's talk about the
three major AAS we have to attend for or

46
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:49,879
three major AAS we have to attend for or
 

47
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,709
three major AAS we have to attend for or
attm we have to attend for for the AAS

48
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:51,719
attm we have to attend for for the AAS
 

49
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,150
attm we have to attend for for the AAS
so we have a

50
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
so we have a
 

51
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,150
so we have a
yokan a

52
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,160
yokan a
 

53
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,310
yokan a
showman and a

54
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,320
showman and a
 

55
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,869
showman and a
ski okay now there are are a few timings

56
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
ski okay now there are are a few timings
 

57
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,509
ski okay now there are are a few timings
we got to talk about in this there's two

58
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:02,519
we got to talk about in this there's two
 

59
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,469
we got to talk about in this there's two
go no sin timings okay so one is Josh

60
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:05,479
go no sin timings okay so one is Josh
 

61
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,749
go no sin timings okay so one is Josh
100% successfully hits me boom we don't

62
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:07,759
100% successfully hits me boom we don't
 

63
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,710
100% successfully hits me boom we don't
have to account for that timing in the

64
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:09,720
have to account for that timing in the
 

65
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,429
have to account for that timing in the
syllabus because it's like well either

66
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
syllabus because it's like well either
 

67
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,429
syllabus because it's like well either
you move on and do the next thing or you

68
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
you move on and do the next thing or you
 

69
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,070
you move on and do the next thing or you
died and that was the end of it so

70
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,080
died and that was the end of it so
 

71
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,350
died and that was the end of it so
there's nothing really to be done about

72
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,360
there's nothing really to be done about
 

73
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,310
there's nothing really to be done about
that you messed up okay then there is I

74
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:19,320
that you messed up okay then there is I
 

75
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,109
that you messed up okay then there is I
got to do a little bit now this timing

76
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
got to do a little bit now this timing
 

77
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,710
got to do a little bit now this timing
still go no sin because Josh completes

78
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:23,720
still go no sin because Josh completes
 

79
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,630
still go no sin because Josh completes
his action it's just I put up a little

80
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:25,640
his action it's just I put up a little
 

81
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,350
his action it's just I put up a little
shield in there to keep him from

82
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
shield in there to keep him from
 

83
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,069
shield in there to keep him from
completing his action we call this a

84
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:29,079
completing his action we call this a
 

85
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,390
completing his action we call this a
little Shield UD sanaku and that just

86
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
little Shield UD sanaku and that just
 

87
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,469
little Shield UD sanaku and that just
means arm triangle so this is my arm

88
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
means arm triangle so this is my arm
 

89
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,870
means arm triangle so this is my arm
triangle I just have a little triangle

90
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
triangle I just have a little triangle
 

91
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,389
triangle I just have a little triangle
in front of my body that protects me

92
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:36,399
in front of my body that protects me
 

93
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,389
in front of my body that protects me
from both sides right here and basically

94
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:38,399
from both sides right here and basically
 

95
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,590
from both sides right here and basically
for something in the middle too because

96
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
for something in the middle too because
 

97
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,429
for something in the middle too because
with a small shift or by crossing my

98
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
with a small shift or by crossing my
 

99
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,870
with a small shift or by crossing my
hand slightly I can catch anything in

100
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
hand slightly I can catch anything in
 

101
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,990
hand slightly I can catch anything in
the middle as well okay so that's UD

102
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,000
the middle as well okay so that's UD
 

103
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,069
the middle as well okay so that's UD
sanaku and that kind of catches Stu

104
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,079
sanaku and that kind of catches Stu
 

105
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,670
sanaku and that kind of catches Stu
that's going to be real primary that UD

106
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:48,680
that's going to be real primary that UD
 

107
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,429
that's going to be real primary that UD
Sanu goes from up here all the way to

108
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
Sanu goes from up here all the way to
 

109
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,670
Sanu goes from up here all the way to
down here and also I can bend my elbows

110
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
down here and also I can bend my elbows
 

111
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,630
down here and also I can bend my elbows
and go like this so it's really wide

112
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
and go like this so it's really wide
 

113
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,230
and go like this so it's really wide
reaching a lot of times people say oh in

114
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
reaching a lot of times people say oh in
 

115
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,230
reaching a lot of times people say oh in
I kiddo we don't account for like a yo

116
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
I kiddo we don't account for like a yo
 

117
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,870
I kiddo we don't account for like a yo
low sideways strike so like a yokuman

118
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:01,880
low sideways strike so like a yokuman
 

119
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,469
low sideways strike so like a yokuman
not a yokan but thrown low if Josh does

120
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
not a yokan but thrown low if Josh does
 

121
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,389
not a yokan but thrown low if Josh does
that I just do this boom and this is

122
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
that I just do this boom and this is
 

123
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,309
that I just do this boom and this is
still just my UD sanaku right and that

124
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
still just my UD sanaku right and that
 

125
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,550
still just my UD sanaku right and that
goes all the way up here okay now for

126
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
goes all the way up here okay now for
 

127
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,190
goes all the way up here okay now for
showman and yokan that late action so

128
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
showman and yokan that late action so
 

129
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,990
showman and yokan that late action so
I'm super late can account for uh can

130
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm super late can account for uh can
 

131
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,869
I'm super late can account for uh can
all be accounted for by that UD sanaku

132
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
all be accounted for by that UD sanaku
 

133
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,790
all be accounted for by that UD sanaku
so if Josh comes in with a yokan if he

134
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
so if Josh comes in with a yokan if he
 

135
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,589
so if Josh comes in with a yokan if he
came in with a gaku yokan so reverse of

136
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
came in with a gaku yokan so reverse of
 

137
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,350
came in with a gaku yokan so reverse of
a regular yokan if he came in with a

138
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
a regular yokan if he came in with a
 

139
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,470
a regular yokan if he came in with a
showman all those can be caught with

140
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480
showman all those can be caught with
 

141
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,110
showman all those can be caught with
this and of course any kind of strike

142
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
this and of course any kind of strike
 

143
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,869
this and of course any kind of strike
that's coming from the periphery could

144
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
that's coming from the periphery could
 

145
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,309
that's coming from the periphery could
be handled in up or down so it doesn't

146
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,319
be handled in up or down so it doesn't
 

147
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,110
be handled in up or down so it doesn't
matter if he strikes low or high I can

148
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
matter if he strikes low or high I can
 

149
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,910
matter if he strikes low or high I can
catch all that with that that's our

150
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
catch all that with that that's our
 

151
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,350
catch all that with that that's our
first line of defense that we're using

152
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
first line of defense that we're using
 

153
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,630
first line of defense that we're using
now if I have better timing than that

154
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
now if I have better timing than that
 

155
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,149
now if I have better timing than that
and I can either be sen noen or senen

156
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,159
and I can either be sen noen or senen
 

157
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,430
and I can either be sen noen or senen
noen then I can do a lot more with that

158
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
noen then I can do a lot more with that
 

159
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,589
noen then I can do a lot more with that
right so I can not be in place which

160

include it all in the original atimi was
 

263
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,150
include it all in the original atimi was
because he's going to have this action

264

because he's going to have this action
 

265
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,790
because he's going to have this action

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
either going to be he's going to pull
 

269
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,469
either going to be he's going to pull
that weapon back like that so he's going

270
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
that weapon back like that so he's going
 

271
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,749
that weapon back like that so he's going
to make another strike he pulls it back

272
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
to make another strike he pulls it back
 

273
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,550
to make another strike he pulls it back
first he's going to push it through he's

274
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:39,560
first he's going to push it through he's
 

275
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,590
first he's going to push it through he's
stronger than me and he pushes it

276

through boom and he hits me or he's
 

279
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,870
through boom and he hits me or he's
going to go around it and hit me in a

280
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:43,880
going to go around it and hit me in a
 

281
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,029
going to go around it and hit me in a
new location that's basically all he's

282
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:46,039
new location that's basically all he's
 

283
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,310
new location that's basically all he's
going to do other than turn around and

towards Josh and this makes the weapon
 

313
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,710
towards Josh and this makes the weapon
relative to me as small as possible

314
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
relative to me as small as possible
 

315
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,590
relative to me as small as possible
right so if it's a longer weapon of

316
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
right so if it's a longer weapon of
 

317
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,870
right so if it's a longer weapon of
course it's going to have more reach but

318
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
course it's going to have more reach but
 

319
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,029
course it's going to have more reach but
I'm making as limited as possible if I

320
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
I'm making as limited as possible if I
 

321
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,790
I'm making as limited as possible if I
just follow his hand down like this you

322

can see he hits me real easy because I'm

324
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
can see he hits me real easy because I'm
 

325
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,270
can see he hits me real easy because I'm
not taking the weapon space away so as

326
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
not taking the weapon space away so as
 

327
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,790
not taking the weapon space away so as
we're going down I really am pushing

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,590
and pull it back as far as possible that
gives me the longest reach and the best

336
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
gives me the longest reach and the best
 

337
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,270
gives me the longest reach and the best
chance of not getting whacked by that

338
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
chance of not getting whacked by that

away boom that's going to end basically

440
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
away boom that's going to end basically
 

441
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,830
away boom that's going to end basically
in a a very direct

442
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
in a a very direct
 

443
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,189
in a a very direct
EO um or uh that's basically it right

444
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:30,199
EO um or uh that's basically it right

enter in or I'm going to catch it right
 

447
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,990
enter in or I'm going to catch it right
there so those are my two basic options

448
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,000
there so those are my two basic options
 

449
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,350
there so those are my two basic options
that I'm going to get from that okay now

450
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
that I'm going to get from that okay now
 

451
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,830
that I'm going to get from that okay now
if we're stuck up on the arms either I

452
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
if we're stuck up on the arms either I
 

453
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,309
if we're stuck up on the arms either I
was slow here or I just caught it here

was slow here or I just caught it here
 

455
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,230
was slow here or I just caught it here
then all I'm going to do is those same

456
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
then all I'm going to do is those same
 

457
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,150
then all I'm going to do is those same
basic ideas if he's pushed in really

458
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
basic ideas if he's pushed in really
 

459
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,070
basic ideas if he's pushed in really
hard up high I can jot on bar pass if he

460
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,080
hard up high I can jot on bar pass if he
 

461
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,070
hard up high I can jot on bar pass if he
goes down low I can sweep out and I can

462
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
goes down low I can sweep out and I can
 

463
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,110
goes down low I can sweep out and I can
gate on bar and come in here right so

464
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
gate on bar and come in here right so
 

465
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,029
gate on bar and come in here right so
same basic options are available to me

466
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
same basic options are available to me
 

467
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,550
same basic options are available to me
less likely to happen and less detailed

468
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:53,560
less likely to happen and less detailed
 

469
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,270
less likely to happen and less detailed
than the yokan right so a little simpler

470
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
than the yokan right so a little simpler
 

471
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,589
than the yokan right so a little simpler
with the showman okay now ski ski is

472
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
with the showman okay now ski ski is
 

473
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,909
with the showman okay now ski ski is
slightly different animal I'm going to

474
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:00,919
slightly different animal I'm going to
 

475
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,110
slightly different animal I'm going to
have you go to your left hand yeah

have you go to your left hand yeah
perfect okay so with the ski if I just

478
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
perfect okay so with the ski if I just
 

479
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,110
perfect okay so with the ski if I just
use the ud sanaku and I'm late it's no

480
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
use the ud sanaku and I'm late it's no
 

481
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,869
use the ud sanaku and I'm late it's no
good that does no good okay even really

482
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:09,879
good that does no good okay even really
 

483
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,469
good that does no good okay even really
maybe maybe I might be able to kind of

484
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:11,479
maybe maybe I might be able to kind of
 

485
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,230
maybe maybe I might be able to kind of
drive it off a little bit if I dove into

486
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,240
drive it off a little bit if I dove into
 

487
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,790
drive it off a little bit if I dove into
it got it to the inside or the outside

488
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
it got it to the inside or the outside
 

489
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,430
it got it to the inside or the outside
either way I might able to kind of get

490
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,440
either way I might able to kind of get
 

491
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,589
either way I might able to kind of get
away with it but basically for ski I

492
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
away with it but basically for ski I
 

493
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,869
away with it but basically for ski I
have to vacate the line that I'm on I

494
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
have to vacate the line that I'm on I
 

495
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,149
have to vacate the line that I'm on I
have to and my udis Sano is going to be

496
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,159
have to and my udis Sano is going to be
 

497
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,990
have to and my udis Sano is going to be
very low and I'm going to suppress as

498
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,000
very low and I'm going to suppress as
 

499
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,670
very low and I'm going to suppress as
best as I can with it so when Josh comes

500
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:26,680
best as I can with it so when Josh comes
 

501
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,990
best as I can with it so when Josh comes
in the basic idea is this I have to be

502
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,000
in the basic idea is this I have to be
 

503
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,149
in the basic idea is this I have to be
vacating that line now a lot of things

504
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,159
vacating that line now a lot of things
 

505
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,110
vacating that line now a lot of things
could happen that could become a

506
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
could happen that could become a
 

507
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,110
could happen that could become a
full-blown suto moari so as he comes in

508
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
full-blown suto moari so as he comes in
 

509
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,149
full-blown suto moari so as he comes in
boom I could do a full-blown suto moari

510
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
boom I could do a full-blown suto moari
 

511
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,430
boom I could do a full-blown suto moari
it could become an Edy boom right all

512
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:38,440
it could become an Edy boom right all
 

513
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,829
it could become an Edy boom right all
kinds of stuff could come off of that

514
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
kinds of stuff could come off of that
 

515
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,190
kinds of stuff could come off of that
but I have to vacate this Lin on just

516
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,200
but I have to vacate this Lin on just
 

517
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,790
but I have to vacate this Lin on just
because I can't trust that I can knock

518
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:43,800
because I can't trust that I can knock
 

519
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,790
because I can't trust that I can knock
his arms off so it's easier to move

520
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:45,800
his arms off so it's easier to move
 

521
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,790
his arms off so it's easier to move
myself so I'm trying to move myself at

522
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800
myself so I'm trying to move myself at
 

523
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,910
myself so I'm trying to move myself at
least slightly off of this line and as I

524
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
least slightly off of this line and as I
 

525
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,190
least slightly off of this line and as I
do that I want my UD sanaku in place

526
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,200
do that I want my UD sanaku in place
 

527
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,350
do that I want my UD sanaku in place
okay now that could happen to the

528
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
okay now that could happen to the
 

529
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,310
okay now that could happen to the
outside which of course would be most

530
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
outside which of course would be most
 

531
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,310
outside which of course would be most
ideal it could also end up happening to

532
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,320
ideal it could also end up happening to
 

533
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,069
ideal it could also end up happening to
the inside way less ideal but that

534
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:00,079
the inside way less ideal but that
 

535
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,310
the inside way less ideal but that
situation could happen and we have to

536
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:01,320
situation could happen and we have to
 

537
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,590
situation could happen and we have to
account for that when we're doing stuff

538
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:02,600
account for that when we're doing stuff
 

539
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,389
account for that when we're doing stuff
so inside or outside could happen I have

540
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
so inside or outside could happen I have
 

541
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,790
so inside or outside could happen I have
to get off the line I'm going to keep my

542
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
to get off the line I'm going to keep my
 

543
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,470
to get off the line I'm going to keep my
UD sanaku really low those are the

544
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
UD sanaku really low those are the
 

545
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,670
UD sanaku really low those are the
fundamental ideas for the atimi AAS

546
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
fundamental ideas for the atimi AAS
 

547
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,069
fundamental ideas for the atimi AAS
they're really simple right once you

548
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:14,079
they're really simple right once you
 

549
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,990
they're really simple right once you
understand yokomen you can use that to

550
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
understand yokomen you can use that to
 

551
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,670
understand yokomen you can use that to
understand showman there's only another

552
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
understand showman there's only another
 

553
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,110
understand showman there's only another
little idea you got to understand about

554
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
little idea you got to understand about
 

555
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,310
little idea you got to understand about
ski and there's not a lot of

556
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
ski and there's not a lot of
 

557
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,069
ski and there's not a lot of
complications in there so those are the

558
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:22,079
complications in there so those are the
 

559
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,550
complications in there so those are the
basic things that we'll get you through

560
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
basic things that we'll get you through

basic things that we'll get you through
in the detail video we'll put a few more

562
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:24,920
in the detail video we'll put a few more
 

563
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,949
in the detail video we'll put a few more
details in and show a few more examples

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
details in and show a few more examples
 

565

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
but that is basically what you need to
 

567
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,190
but that is basically what you need to
