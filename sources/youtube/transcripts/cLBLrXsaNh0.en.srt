but what is the real main difference if

130
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
but what is the real main difference if
 

131
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,070
but what is the real main difference if
we're looking at

132
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
we're looking at
 

133
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,270
we're looking at
