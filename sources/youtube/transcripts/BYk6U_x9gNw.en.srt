to just go back a moment and I suggested
 

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,550
to just go back a moment and I suggested
that you do five of each of the Joe

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,560
that you do five of each of the Joe
 

11

Joe but it's going to take you a lot
 

53
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,310
Joe but it's going to take you a lot
longer to get three of the Joe feeling

54
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
longer to get three of the Joe feeling
 

55
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,830
longer to get three of the Joe feeling
the same because you got 20 of them to

56
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
the same because you got 20 of them to
 

57
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
the same because you got 20 of them to
get through so this would should take a

00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
get through so this would should take a
 

59
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,670
get through so this would should take a
long time might take years could take

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,680
long time might take years could take
 

61
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,030

on how deep you want to
go but the same as with the can if

68
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,200
go but the same as with the can if
 

69
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,469
go but the same as with the can if
you're going to do

70
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:43,479
you're going to do
 

71
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,230
you're going to do
HAPO with the uh Joe I suggest you do

72
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
HAPO with the uh Joe I suggest you do
 

73
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,630
HAPO with the uh Joe I suggest you do
the same thing by striking it using the

74
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,640
the same thing by striking it using the
 

75
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,910
the same thing by striking it using the
Striking method as if it's a Ken once

76
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
Striking method as if it's a Ken once
 

77
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,389
Striking method as if it's a Ken once
you've done that with a

78
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
you've done that with a
 

79
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,630
you've done that with a
Joe can you make that Joe feel like a

80
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
Joe can you make that Joe feel like a
 

81
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,190
Joe can you make that Joe feel like a
Ken yes it's round it's longer it will

82
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,200
Ken yes it's round it's longer it will
 

83
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,070
Ken yes it's round it's longer it will
feel different than the Ken but your aim

84
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
feel different than the Ken but your aim
 

85
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,710
feel different than the Ken but your aim
now is to make the Ken or Joe feel part

86
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
now is to make the Ken or Joe feel part
 

87
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,710
now is to make the Ken or Joe feel part
of you so when you're using it you're

88
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
of you so when you're using it you're
 

89
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,910
of you so when you're using it you're
trying to feel the balance of you within

90
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
trying to feel the balance of you within
 

91
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,589
trying to feel the balance of you within
that Ken within that Joe rather than it

92
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
that Ken within that Joe rather than it
 

93
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,470
that Ken within that Joe rather than it
be becoming a distinguished separation

94
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
be becoming a distinguished separation
 

95
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,030
be becoming a distinguished separation
of Ken or Joe

96
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040

 

97
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,949

um once you've done the first

98
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
um once you've done the first
 

99
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,670
um once you've done the first
subur you can do the second subari with

100
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
subur you can do the second subari with
 

101
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,589
subur you can do the second subari with
the Joe the third subury the fourth

102
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
the Joe the third subury the fourth
 

103
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,190
the Joe the third subury the fourth
subari the fifth subari the sixth subari

104
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
subari the fifth subari the sixth subari
 

105
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,670
subari the fifth subari the sixth subari
the seventh C subur so this is then your

106
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,680
the seventh C subur so this is then your
 

107
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,509
the seventh C subur so this is then your
program now at this stage with the Joe

108
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
program now at this stage with the Joe
 

109
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,390
program now at this stage with the Joe
you're trying to see if you can

110
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
you're trying to see if you can
 

111
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,790
you're trying to see if you can
replicate the C feeling but with the

112
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:01,800
replicate the C feeling but with the
 

113
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,910
replicate the C feeling but with the
using the

114
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:02,920
using the
 

115
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,910
using the
Joe you'll find this very challenging I

116
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
Joe you'll find this very challenging I
 

117
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,229
Joe you'll find this very challenging I
think so again you're looking for five

118
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
think so again you're looking for five
 

119
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,630
think so again you're looking for five
repetitions you're trying to hit hit a

120
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
repetitions you're trying to hit hit a
 

121
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,750
repetitions you're trying to hit hit a
target of three feeling the

122
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
target of three feeling the
 

123
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,910
target of three feeling the
same out of the out of each five

124
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
same out of the out of each five
 

125
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,550
same out of the out of each five
segments you take that pause of breath

126
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
segments you take that pause of breath
 

127
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,710
segments you take that pause of breath
before you do the next five pause a

128
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720
before you do the next five pause a
 

129
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,910
before you do the next five pause a
breath before you do the next five and

130
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
breath before you do the next five and
 

131
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,830
breath before you do the next five and
depending on the amount of time that you

132
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
depending on the amount of time that you
 

133
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,630
depending on the amount of time that you
can spare to give it each time and if

134
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
can spare to give it each time and if
 

135
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,309
can spare to give it each time and if
you can do it daily then it's

136
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:35,319
you can do it daily then it's
 

137
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,350
you can do it daily then it's
great um your aim is to get three of

138
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
great um your aim is to get three of
 

139
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,509
great um your aim is to get three of
those feeling the same whether it now be

140
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,519
those feeling the same whether it now be
 

141
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,149
those feeling the same whether it now be
with Ken or Joe but don't try with the

142
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
with Ken or Joe but don't try with the
 

143
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,750
with Ken or Joe but don't try with the
Joe and then say I think I've got it and

144
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,760
Joe and then say I think I've got it and
 

145
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,229
Joe and then say I think I've got it and
then take your Ken and do it with the

146
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
then take your Ken and do it with the
 

147
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,630
then take your Ken and do it with the
Ken and try to see if it feels the same

00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
Ken and try to see if it feels the same
 

149
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,550
Ken and try to see if it feels the same
