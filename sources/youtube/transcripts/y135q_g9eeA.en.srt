00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,309

okay so

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
okay so
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,389
okay so
again uh you move into the in space you

4
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:07,399
again uh you move into the in space you
 

5
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,270
again uh you move into the in space you
only enter into the in space okay so

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,280
only enter into the in space okay so
 

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,190
only enter into the in space okay so
you're not y y clashing okay so he go he

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
you're not y y clashing okay so he go he
 

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,750
you're not y y clashing okay so he go he
goes he does Mount

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:15,760
goes he does Mount
 

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,870
goes he does Mount
reversal and he's going to want to

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
reversal and he's going to want to
 

13
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,910
reversal and he's going to want to
posture up okay and start working his

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,920
posture up okay and start working his
 

15
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,429
posture up okay and start working his
escapes and preventions and things like

16
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
escapes and preventions and things like
 

17
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,390
escapes and preventions and things like
that

18
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:25,400
that
 

19
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,230
that
okay well that creates the in space so I

20
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,240
okay well that creates the in space so I
 

21
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,950
okay well that creates the in space so I
am already looking as I feel like whoa

22
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:31,960
am already looking as I feel like whoa
 

23
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,830
am already looking as I feel like whoa
whoa okay and he gets it come on and I

he got me okay I'm already looking
 

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,990
he got me okay I'm already looking
for that space you see and I'm already

28
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
for that space you see and I'm already
 

29
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,869
for that space you see and I'm already
looking for that arm to do the pendulum

going to get it okay you have to go with
 

53
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,670
going to get it okay you have to go with
the timing opening he goes you already

54
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
the timing opening he goes you already
 

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,270

chasing
 

59
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,350
chasing
it is that

60
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360

 

61
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,069

really try it again

62
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,079

 

63
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,389

okay see if you can shorten that don't

64
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:37,399
okay see if you can shorten that don't
 

65
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,870
okay see if you can shorten that don't
go dead like that right

66
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
go dead like that right
 

67
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,670
go dead like that right
go all right so slow back down he's

68
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
go all right so slow back down he's
 

69
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,670
go all right so slow back down he's
going right about here I I know oh he

70
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
going right about here I I know oh he
 

71
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,429
going right about here I I know oh he
got it I'm going to lose this okay what

72
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:52,439
got it I'm going to lose this okay what
 

73
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,830
got it I'm going to lose this okay what
I'm talking about is just let go of it

74
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm talking about is just let go of it
 

75
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,270
I'm talking about is just let go of it
then you didn't lose it okay and now I

76
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,280
then you didn't lose it okay and now I
 

77
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,990
then you didn't lose it okay and now I
start looking for this arm you see I

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,000
start looking for this arm you see I
 

79
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,830
start looking for this arm you see I
don't let him grab onto it or anything

80
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
don't let him grab onto it or anything
 

81
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,830
don't let him grab onto it or anything
okay so I already made the connection go

82
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:08,840

 

83
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,550

back

84
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
back
 

85
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,630
back
see he has the walk comes around and

86
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:15,640
see he has the walk comes around and
 

87
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,790
see he has the walk comes around and
here's where I traded position I'm

88
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
here's where I traded position I'm
 

89
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,070
here's where I traded position I'm
keeping that arm away from grabbing it's

90
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,080
keeping that arm away from grabbing it's
 

91
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,150
keeping that arm away from grabbing it's
as good as in the admin position if

92
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,160
as good as in the admin position if
 

93
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,710
as good as in the admin position if
someone puts it on the ground okay and

94
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
someone puts it on the ground okay and
 

95
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,270
someone puts it on the ground okay and
now I start start working with his

96
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
now I start start working with his
 

97
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,670
now I start start working with his
energy so I don't go now it's as he

98
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
energy so I don't go now it's as he
 

99
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,750
energy so I don't go now it's as he
slowly is going up that's where I start

100
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:38,760
slowly is going up that's where I start
 

101
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,750
slowly is going up that's where I start
to follow it follow that energy okay and

102
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:42,760
to follow it follow that energy okay and
 

103
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,270
to follow it follow that energy okay and
once you get here don't go for that

104
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
once you get here don't go for that
 

105
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,070
once you get here don't go for that
turn take his Center rout first ever so

106
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
turn take his Center rout first ever so
 

107
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,670
turn take his Center rout first ever so
slightly boom and now go for the

108
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
slightly boom and now go for the
 

109
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,190
slightly boom and now go for the
turn

110
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
turn
 

111
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,910
turn
Okay destructure him by pushing his

112
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,920
Okay destructure him by pushing his
 

113
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,550
Okay destructure him by pushing his
Center out of his posture okay try it

114
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:01,560
Center out of his posture okay try it
 

115
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,190
Center out of his posture okay try it
again all right we'll start at the

116
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200

 

117
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,869

bottom okay so I got

118
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:07,879
bottom okay so I got
 

119
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,830
bottom okay so I got
here and realize that uh this hip bump

120
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
here and realize that uh this hip bump
 

121
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,869
here and realize that uh this hip bump
sweep it works best if he goes all the

122
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
sweep it works best if he goes all the
 

123
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,869
sweep it works best if he goes all the
way up

124
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
way up
 

125
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,309
way up
okay and then realize too that uh as he

126
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:21,319
okay and then realize too that uh as he
 

127
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,149
okay and then realize too that uh as he
feels you coming up he might not go all

128
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
feels you coming up he might not go all
 

129
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,149
feels you coming up he might not go all
the way up so he starts to push down you

130
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
the way up so he starts to push down you
 

131
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,270
the way up so he starts to push down you
see well that's where you have

132
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
see well that's where you have
 

133
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,350
see well that's where you have
all those things that we were working on

134
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,360
all those things that we were working on
 

135
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,429
all those things that we were working on
okay so here I have goo here's my elbow

136
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,439

 

137
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,229

right these two the igami and the hip

138
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
right these two the igami and the hip
 

139
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,789
right these two the igami and the hip
bump they play off each other if he's

140
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:47,799
bump they play off each other if he's
 

141
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,309
bump they play off each other if he's
anywhere in this area with this hand off

142
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:51,319
anywhere in this area with this hand off
 

143
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,589
anywhere in this area with this hand off
the ground good that arms isolated and

144
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,599
the ground good that arms isolated and
 

145
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,309
the ground good that arms isolated and
exposed if he counts so for example if I

146
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,319
exposed if he counts so for example if I
 

147
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,550
exposed if he counts so for example if I
try for that one and he postur up you're

148
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
try for that one and he postur up you're
 

149
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,350
try for that one and he postur up you're
going to have a hard time getting it but

150
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
going to have a hard time getting it but
 

151
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,990
going to have a hard time getting it but
that's what opens up the hip bump okay

152
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
that's what opens up the hip bump okay
 

153
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,190
that's what opens up the hip bump okay
so they play off each other if I'm

154
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,200
so they play off each other if I'm
 

155
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,390
so they play off each other if I'm
trying for the hip bump and he starts to

156
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
trying for the hip bump and he starts to
 

157
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,589
trying for the hip bump and he starts to
posture down then you ATT the arm cuz

158
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
posture down then you ATT the arm cuz
 

159
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,949
posture down then you ATT the arm cuz
he's coming back forward

160
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:15,959
he's coming back forward
 

161
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,590
he's coming back forward
