1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,429

so

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439

 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,950

what is a marriage with gravity

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
what is a marriage with gravity
 

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,669
what is a marriage with gravity
all right so if uh you come out here

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
all right so if uh you come out here
 

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,709
all right so if uh you come out here
and you hold that end up

8
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
and you hold that end up
 

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,430
and you hold that end up
in your you're offering some resistance

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
in your you're offering some resistance
 

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,310
in your you're offering some resistance
right

12
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
right
 

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,029
right
you get it you feel that okay you're

14
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
you get it you feel that okay you're
 

15
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,070
you get it you feel that okay you're
lifting that

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
lifting that
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,550
lifting that
is some resistance to me pushing down

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
is some resistance to me pushing down
 

19
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,910
is some resistance to me pushing down
okay

20
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
okay
 

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,669
okay
um and when we are doing our

22
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
um and when we are doing our
 

23
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,030
um and when we are doing our
showmance booty a lot of us

24
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
showmance booty a lot of us
 

25
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,709
showmance booty a lot of us
are trying to uh put weight on this

26
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
are trying to uh put weight on this
 

27
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,030
are trying to uh put weight on this
you do feel some increase right there's

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
you do feel some increase right there's
 

29
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,150
you do feel some increase right there's
some increase

30
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
some increase
 

31
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,830
some increase
and you could see if we if we put more

32
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
and you could see if we if we put more
 

33
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,310
and you could see if we if we put more
uh

34
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
uh
 

35
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,790
uh
weight on this and we'll bend our knees

36
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
weight on this and we'll bend our knees
 

37
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,510
weight on this and we'll bend our knees
to do it

38
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
to do it
 

39
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,069
to do it
it got a little heavier you see but at a

40
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
it got a little heavier you see but at a
 

41
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,229
it got a little heavier you see but at a
certain point it gets counterproductive

42
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
certain point it gets counterproductive
 

43
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,630
certain point it gets counterproductive
you see so you'll feel original some

44
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
you see so you'll feel original some
 

45
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,430
you see so you'll feel original some
heaviness

46
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
heaviness
 

47
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,750
heaviness
and then it's starting to get light you

48
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
and then it's starting to get light you
 

49
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,430
and then it's starting to get light you
see

50
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440

 

51
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,990

and that's what we think is going on in

52
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
and that's what we think is going on in
 

53
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,910
and that's what we think is going on in
childhood

54
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
childhood
 

55
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,190
childhood
so i come up and then

56
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
so i come up and then
 

57
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,789
so i come up and then
i dropped my weight and you see some

58
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
i dropped my weight and you see some
 

59
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,710
i dropped my weight and you see some
people really exaggerated

60
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
people really exaggerated
 

61
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,670
people really exaggerated
you see and it's becoming like a

62
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
you see and it's becoming like a
 

63
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,550
you see and it's becoming like a
quadricep

64
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
quadricep
 

65
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,390
quadricep
exercise and though that's the benefit

66
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
exercise and though that's the benefit
 

67
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,350
exercise and though that's the benefit
of it you're making your legs stronger

68
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
of it you're making your legs stronger
 

69
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,670
of it you're making your legs stronger
um but this is this is all external

70
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
um but this is this is all external
 

71
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,230
um but this is this is all external
it's all external i lower my body mass

72
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240

 

73
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,950

and i'll get some force on that on the

74
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
and i'll get some force on that on the
 

75
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,190
and i'll get some force on that on the
cut

76
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200

 

77
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,990

okay uh and going up

78
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
okay uh and going up
 

79
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,670
okay uh and going up
is just a resetting or an indexing

80
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
is just a resetting or an indexing
 

81
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,030
is just a resetting or an indexing
of that so i go up

82
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
of that so i go up
 

83
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,910
of that so i go up
and then down

84
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920

 

85
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,830

but everything should be done internally

86
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
but everything should be done internally
 

87
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,430
but everything should be done internally
and if i want to make my legs stronger

88
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
and if i want to make my legs stronger
 

89
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,390
and if i want to make my legs stronger
i should squat

90
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400

 

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,710

so what i'm going to do instead is i

92
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
so what i'm going to do instead is i
 

93
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,070
so what i'm going to do instead is i
have

94
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
have
 

95
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,350
have
two

96
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360

 

97
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,990

four centers one is at the top when the

98
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
four centers one is at the top when the
 

99
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,670
four centers one is at the top when the
sword is trying to change direction

100
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
sword is trying to change direction
 

101
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,350
sword is trying to change direction
there's energy

102
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
there's energy
 

103
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,110
there's energy
and i'm going to send that energy

104
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
and i'm going to send that energy
 

105
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,630
and i'm going to send that energy
through me

106
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
through me
 

107
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,229
through me
down into the ground and the other one

108
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
down into the ground and the other one
 

109
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,830
down into the ground and the other one
is when the sword hits its position at

110
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
is when the sword hits its position at
 

111
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,790
is when the sword hits its position at
the end

112
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
the end
 

113
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,990
the end
boom and i'm going to send that force

114
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
boom and i'm going to send that force
 

115
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,030
boom and i'm going to send that force
into my body too and i'm kind of like

116
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
into my body too and i'm kind of like
 

117
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,460
into my body too and i'm kind of like
playing

118
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,470
playing
 

119
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,710
playing
[Music]

120
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
[Music]
 

121
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,390
[Music]
between these two ground vectors

122
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
between these two ground vectors
 

123
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,229
between these two ground vectors
so as opposed to be going up

124
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
so as opposed to be going up
 

125
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,070
so as opposed to be going up
and down you're going to see

126
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
and down you're going to see
 

127
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,869
and down you're going to see
a force vectoring at the top and then

128
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
a force vectoring at the top and then
 

129
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,990
a force vectoring at the top and then
it'll look

130
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
it'll look
 

131
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:14,790
it'll look
exactly like the one at the bottom

132
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800

 

133
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,750

which allows for that kind of bouncing

134
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
which allows for that kind of bouncing
 

135
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,710
which allows for that kind of bouncing
the sword is just

136
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
the sword is just
 

137
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,070
the sword is just
bouncing back and forth between the two

138
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
bouncing back and forth between the two
 

139
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,470
bouncing back and forth between the two
and i'm just riding the sword my hands

140
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
and i'm just riding the sword my hands
 

141
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,550
and i'm just riding the sword my hands
are just riding the sword

142
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
are just riding the sword
 

143
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,830
are just riding the sword
and the other one

144
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
and the other one
 

145
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,750
and the other one
very difficult to have it be

146
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
very difficult to have it be
 

147
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,030
very difficult to have it be
spring-loaded

148
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
spring-loaded
 

149
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,270
spring-loaded
at the top and bottom so

150
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280

 

151
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,470

what is important is to get away from

152
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
what is important is to get away from
 

153
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,470
what is important is to get away from
the external

154
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
the external
 

155
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,550
the external
is that you stop doing the external

156
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
is that you stop doing the external
 

157
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,309
is that you stop doing the external
don't drop your center

158
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319

 

159
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:18,069

even three inches

160
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079

 

161
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,550

you'll feel stop relying on this

162
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
you'll feel stop relying on this
 

163
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,070
you'll feel stop relying on this
maybe i'll stumble across the ground

164
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
maybe i'll stumble across the ground
 

165
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,270
maybe i'll stumble across the ground
vector

166
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
vector
 

167
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,150
vector
okay top one

168
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
okay top one
 

169
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,909
okay top one
is harder to get because our minds are

170
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
is harder to get because our minds are
 

171
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,230
is harder to get because our minds are
like

172
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
like
 

173
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,430
like
i'm going up i'm coming up but there's

174
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
i'm going up i'm coming up but there's
 

175
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,550
i'm going up i'm coming up but there's
