in the
 

171
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,270
in the
moment and uh these pins are not real

172
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,280
moment and uh these pins are not real
 

173
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,230
moment and uh these pins are not real
pins so for as we get on further for

174
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
pins so for as we get on further for
 

175
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,110
pins so for as we get on further for
example the Wasa must be real so if you

176
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
example the Wasa must be real so if you
 

177
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,990
example the Wasa must be real so if you
are trying to pin someone down that

178
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
are trying to pin someone down that
 

179
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,749
are trying to pin someone down that
means they should not be getting up but

180
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:54,759
means they should not be getting up but
 

181
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,550
means they should not be getting up but
in every one of aikido's pins which I

182
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,560
in every one of aikido's pins which I
 

183
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,110
in every one of aikido's pins which I
call CQ exercises

184
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
call CQ exercises
 

185
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,390
call CQ exercises
the UK can get up so it's not a real pin

186
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
the UK can get up so it's not a real pin
 

187
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,590
the UK can get up so it's not a real pin
we don't practice the coku pins in guaza

188
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
we don't practice the coku pins in guaza
 

189
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,990
we don't practice the coku pins in guaza
okay because the technique must be real

190
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,000
okay because the technique must be real
 

191
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,270
okay because the technique must be real
and

192
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
and
 

193
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,150
and
also the UK never seeks

194
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
also the UK never seeks
 

195
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,270
also the UK never seeks
agency when the UK decides to lay at the

196
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
agency when the UK decides to lay at the
 

197
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,790
agency when the UK decides to lay at the
bottom instead of getting up because

198
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:23,800
bottom instead of getting up because
 

199
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,629
bottom instead of getting up because
they can that is Seeking a agency so

200
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:27,639
they can that is Seeking a agency so
 

201
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,629
they can that is Seeking a agency so
that's not good that's not not allowed

202

that's not good that's not not allowed
 

203
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,909
that's not good that's not not allowed
okay so for example in the video that we

204
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
okay so for example in the video that we
 

205
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,430
okay so for example in the video that we
showed last

206
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
showed last
 

207
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,070

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
forward and now he's off of it okay so I
 

227
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,350
forward and now he's off of it okay so I
corrected him by going sure let's rewind

maybe and uh he doesn't know K that's
why he's not in a

330
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
why he's not in a
 

331
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,430
why he's not in a
Haka

332
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
Haka
 

333
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,790
Haka
um there's just so much he doesn't know

334
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:01,800
um there's just so much he doesn't know
 

335
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,350
um there's just so much he doesn't know
and so I threw him and you could see his

336
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,360
and so I threw him and you could see his
 

337
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,269
and so I threw him and you could see his
body got picked up he got rotated in

338
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
body got picked up he got rotated in
 

339
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,750
body got picked up he got rotated in
space and he dropped down that's that's

340
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
space and he dropped down that's that's
 

341
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,269
space and he dropped down that's that's
a real mechanics that would happen to

342
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,279
a real mechanics that would happen to
 

343
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,069
a real mechanics that would happen to
anybody

344
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:16,079
anybody
 

345
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,829
anybody
uh is equally to someone who knows how

346
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:18,839
uh is equally to someone who knows how
 

347
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,990
uh is equally to someone who knows how
to fall and someone who does not know

348
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,000
to fall and someone who does not know
 

349
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,750
to fall and someone who does not know
how to fall okay so technique must be

350
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
how to fall okay so technique must be
 

351
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,670
how to fall okay so technique must be
real um hence no I tyo as well so II tyo

352
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
real um hence no I tyo as well so II tyo
 

353
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,350

work like yeah that's in iido but that's

358
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
work like yeah that's in iido but that's
 

359
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,990
work like yeah that's in iido but that's
not in guaza okay we want to see um a

360
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,000
not in guaza okay we want to see um a
 

361
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,750
not in guaza okay we want to see um a
some sort of finality or conclusion to

362
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
some sort of finality or conclusion to
 

363
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,509
some sort of finality or conclusion to
the

364
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:52,519
the
 

365
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,069
the
engagement so if you throw

366
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:56,079
engagement so if you throw
 

367
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:59,750
engagement so if you throw
someone uh in the street they don't get

368
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
someone uh in the street they don't get
 

369
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,630
someone uh in the street they don't get
up like iido people think you you you

370
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
up like iido people think you you you
 

371
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,190
up like iido people think you you you
drop anyone from I would say knee height

372
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
drop anyone from I would say knee height
 

373
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,670
drop anyone from I would say knee height
they don't get up um they might not be

374
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:10,680
they don't get up um they might not be
 

375
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,150
they don't get up um they might not be
unconscious but ankles are thrash feet

376
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
unconscious but ankles are thrash feet
 

377
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,470
unconscious but ankles are thrash feet
are thrash knees are thrash it's very

378
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
are thrash knees are thrash it's very
 

379
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,910
are thrash knees are thrash it's very
very difficult to um get up now let

380
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
very difficult to um get up now let
 

381
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,550
very difficult to um get up now let
alone you have their body going Topsy

382
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
alone you have their body going Topsy
 

383
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,470
alone you have their body going Topsy
Turvy like you're doing shag or or Ed

384
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
Turvy like you're doing shag or or Ed
 

385
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,230
Turvy like you're doing shag or or Ed
nag they're not getting up they're not

386
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
nag they're not getting up they're not
 

387
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,550
nag they're not getting up they're not
getting up okay

388
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
getting up okay
 

389
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,910
getting up okay
um it's one reason why for example I

390
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
um it's one reason why for example I
 

391
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,509
um it's one reason why for example I
used to do the pin following edag but if

392
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
used to do the pin following edag but if
 

393
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,990
used to do the pin following edag but if
you pay attention I don't pin out of VI

394
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,000
you pay attention I don't pin out of VI
 

395
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,430
you pay attention I don't pin out of VI
Minag anymore

396
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
Minag anymore
 

397
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,069
Minag anymore
because why am I going to pin someone

398
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
because why am I going to pin someone
 

399
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,389
because why am I going to pin someone
who's unconscious do do you understand

400
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
who's unconscious do do you understand
 

401
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,430
who's unconscious do do you understand
what I'm saying so it's kind of like

402
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:50,440
what I'm saying so it's kind of like
 

403
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,590
what I'm saying so it's kind of like
when I teach the kids um not the kids or

404
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,600
when I teach the kids um not the kids or
 

405
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,629
when I teach the kids um not the kids or
adults but in the police

406
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:56,639
adults but in the police
 

407
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,550
adults but in the police
academy um if we shoot somebody body and

408
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
academy um if we shoot somebody body and
 

409
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,629
academy um if we shoot somebody body and
there's brains on the street I'm not

410
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:03,639
there's brains on the street I'm not
 

411
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,629

going to handcuff him he's already in a

412
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:06,639
going to handcuff him he's already in a
 

413
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,750
going to handcuff him he's already in a
position of disadvantage okay so I need

414
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
position of disadvantage okay so I need
 

415
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,829
position of disadvantage okay so I need
to get on to Medical I'm not going to go

416
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
to get on to Medical I'm not going to go
 

417
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,470
to get on to Medical I'm not going to go
officer safety let me handcuff them

418
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
officer safety let me handcuff them
 

419
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,269
officer safety let me handcuff them
before I get to Medical that that

420
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
before I get to Medical that that
 

421
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,069
before I get to Medical that that
doesn't make sense okay so as I always

422
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
doesn't make sense okay so as I always
 

423
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,790
doesn't make sense okay so as I always
tell them code blue is the greatest

424
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
tell them code blue is the greatest
 

425
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,190
tell them code blue is the greatest
position of disadvantage I don't need to

426
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
position of disadvantage I don't need to
 

427
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,269
position of disadvantage I don't need to
control this person anymore so if I

428
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
control this person anymore so if I
 

429
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,949
control this person anymore so if I
throw someone in need even N I don't now

430
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
throw someone in need even N I don't now
 

431
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,150
throw someone in need even N I don't now
need to pin their arm that that's crazy

432
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,160
need to pin their arm that that's crazy
 

433
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,590
need to pin their arm that that's crazy
okay so there's a finality to the throws

434
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:38,600
okay so there's a finality to the throws
 

435

um equally then rule six the throws

464
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
um equally then rule six the throws
 

465
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,110
um equally then rule six the throws
should be

466
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
should be
 

467
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,110
should be
effortless and the metric for that is

468
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,120
effortless and the metric for that is
 

469
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,870
effortless and the metric for that is
hand weight should be ample just your

470
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:33,880
hand weight should be ample just your
 

471
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,110
hand weight should be ample just your
hand weight should do it if you have to

472
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,120
hand weight should do it if you have to
 

473
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,910
hand weight should do it if you have to
use any muscle or something you're in a

474
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
use any muscle or something you're in a
 

475
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,910
use any muscle or something you're in a
you're forcing the technique you

476
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:42,920
you're forcing the technique you
 

477
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,750
you're forcing the technique you
probably have a Yong Yong Clash going

478
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
probably have a Yong Yong Clash going
 

479
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,750
probably have a Yong Yong Clash going
and so you need more force uh and for

480
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:48,760
and so you need more force uh and for
 

481
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,710
and so you need more force uh and for
this kind of training uh due to its low

482
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
this kind of training uh due to its low
 

483
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,230
this kind of training uh due to its low
rate of acceleration and and its low

484
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
rate of acceleration and and its low
 

485
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,230
rate of acceleration and and its low
volume of inertia there's no reason why

486
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,240
volume of inertia there's no reason why
 

487
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,910
volume of inertia there's no reason why
you ever have to move past hand weight

488

techniques theuk always is letting me do
 

537
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,509
techniques theuk always is letting me do
those techniques they are constantly and

538
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
those techniques they are constantly and
 

539
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,350
those techniques they are constantly and
be honest they're kind of trying to

540
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,360
be honest they're kind of trying to
 

541
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,949
be honest they're kind of trying to
figure out always which technique is are

542
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
figure out always which technique is are
 

543
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,150
figure out always which technique is are
they trying to do and as soon as they

544
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,160
they trying to do and as soon as they
 

545
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,389
they trying to do and as soon as they
figure out they position their body uh

546
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
figure out they position their body uh
 

547
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,910
figure out they position their body uh
in order for you to do that technique

548
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:32,920
in order for you to do that technique
 

549
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,590
in order for you to do that technique
okay so for

550
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,600
okay so for
 

551
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,350
okay so for
example if I'm if I'm here and

552
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,360
example if I'm if I'm here and
 

553
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,790
example if I'm if I'm here and
eventually he figures out that I'm going

554
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
eventually he figures out that I'm going
 

555
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,030
eventually he figures out that I'm going
to do teni nugget do you see that okay

556
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,040
to do teni nugget do you see that okay
 

557
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,829
to do teni nugget do you see that okay
so I'm going to do tension net and he

558
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:46,839
so I'm going to do tension net and he
 

559
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,590
so I'm going to do tension net and he
kind of leaned back for

560
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
kind of leaned back for
 

561
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,910
kind of leaned back for
me before I came in you see do you get

562
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
me before I came in you see do you get
 

563
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,350
me before I came in you see do you get
that and uh

564
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360

 

565
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,710

that would be UK seeking agency he moved

566
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
that would be UK seeking agency he moved
 

567
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,590

um and that is uh related to I have to

572
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:11,720
um and that is uh related to I have to
 

573
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,590
um and that is uh related to I have to
not expect UK to do anything for me so

574
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,600
not expect UK to do anything for me so
 

575
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,389
not expect UK to do anything for me so
whatever UK is doing is right okay so

what technique it is because they should
never seek agency okay so have it in

602
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:03,560
never seek agency okay so have it in
 

603
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,230

just happens all the time okay and so

630
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
just happens all the time okay and so
 

631
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,470
just happens all the time okay and so
you will get very

632
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:55,480
you will get very
 

633
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,910
you will get very
frustrated you're like here and I'm

634
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:58,920
frustrated you're like here and I'm
 

635
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,949
frustrated you're like here and I'm
taking you down and I'm trying to shove

636
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
taking you down and I'm trying to shove
 

637
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,949
taking you down and I'm trying to shove
you back you see and you're like uh okay

you back you see and you're like uh okay
 

639
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,590
you back you see and you're like uh okay
then you like stop and you'll start over

640
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,600
then you like stop and you'll start over
 

641
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,870
then you like stop and you'll start over
and it no you have to figure that out

642
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:09,880
and it no you have to figure that out
 

643
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,949
and it no you have to figure that out
you came here you realize you shouldn't

644
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:11,959
you came here you realize you shouldn't
 

645
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,350
you came here you realize you shouldn't
be clashing so you have to figure out

646
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:14,360
be clashing so you have to figure out
 

647
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,470
be clashing so you have to figure out
how to do something else without

648
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,480
how to do something else without
 

649
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,230
how to do something else without
breaking any of the rules you cannot

650
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
breaking any of the rules you cannot
 

651
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,390
breaking any of the rules you cannot
disengage and start over that is very

652
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
disengage and start over that is very
 

653
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,029
disengage and start over that is very
much akin

654
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:26,039
much akin
 

655
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,549
much akin
to

656
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:27,559
to
 

657
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,669
to
um if we're going to work on these two

658
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:30,679
um if we're going to work on these two
 

659
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,310
um if we're going to work on these two
minds you can't quit and you can't

660
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,320
minds you can't quit and you can't
 

661
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,710
minds you can't quit and you can't
Retreat and you can't disengage because

662
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:35,720
Retreat and you can't disengage because
 

663
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,029
Retreat and you can't disengage because
that's going to be your instinct okay

664
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,039
that's going to be your instinct okay
 

665
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,830
that's going to be your instinct okay
and so no everything counts you didn't

666
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:40,840
and so no everything counts you didn't
 

667
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,909
and so no everything counts you didn't
mess up UK didn't mess up you got to

668
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
mess up UK didn't mess up you got to
 

669
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,750
mess up UK didn't mess up you got to
figure this out

670
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:46,760
figure this out
 

671
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,669
figure this out
okay another rule is you're not allowed

672
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
okay another rule is you're not allowed
 

673
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,029
okay another rule is you're not allowed
to stop UK so every time you stop the UK

674
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:54,039
to stop UK so every time you stop the UK
 

675
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,070
to stop UK so every time you stop the UK
boom you just used one of your four

676
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,080
boom you just used one of your four
 

677
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,549
boom you just used one of your four
attempts that that's not not something

678
00:17:59,549 --> 00:17:59,559
attempts that that's not not something
 

679
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,430
attempts that that's not not something
you you figure out you up you

680
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,440
you you figure out you up you
 

681
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,590
you you figure out you up you
stopped the UK the the the UK should let

682
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
stopped the UK the the the UK should let
 

683
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,310
stopped the UK the the the UK should let
go come back out and go they got three

684
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,320
go come back out and go they got three
 

685
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,350
go come back out and go they got three
more then it's my turn Okay anytime that

686
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,360
more then it's my turn Okay anytime that
 

687
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,750
more then it's my turn Okay anytime that
UK

688
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
UK
 

689
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,230
UK
stops um next one we already talked

690
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,240
stops um next one we already talked
 

691
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,710
stops um next one we already talked
about UK never seeks agency so equally

692
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
about UK never seeks agency so equally
 

693
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,710
about UK never seeks agency so equally
UK is not trying to counter my

694
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
UK is not trying to counter my
 

695
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,390
UK is not trying to counter my
techniques but UK is also not trying to

696
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,400
techniques but UK is also not trying to
 

697
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,909
techniques but UK is also not trying to
assist my techniques they're not not

698
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:28,919
assist my techniques they're not not
 

699
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,470
assist my techniques they're not not
trying to give my techniques they just

700
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,480
trying to give my techniques they just
 

701
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,789
trying to give my techniques they just
followed the

702
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
followed the
 

703
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,630
followed the
energy um that nag is is giving them

704
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:37,640
energy um that nag is is giving them
 

705
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,110
energy um that nag is is giving them
that's all they do okay um so for

706
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
that's all they do okay um so for
 

707
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,110
that's all they do okay um so for
example

708
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,120
example
 

709
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,590
example
um you uh enter turn and and C you

710
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
um you uh enter turn and and C you
 

711
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,230
um you uh enter turn and and C you
n ENT the arm turn and cook you nuget

712
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
n ENT the arm turn and cook you nuget
 

713
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,190
n ENT the arm turn and cook you nuget
okay so a lot of the UK will feel

714
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
okay so a lot of the UK will feel
 

715
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,430
okay so a lot of the UK will feel
that and then they take the

716
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:04,440
that and then they take the
 

717
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,390
that and then they take the
agency and they take the

718
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,400
agency and they take the
 

719
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,990
agency and they take the
roll as opposed to he's

720
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,000
roll as opposed to he's
 

721
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,350
roll as opposed to he's
going and they take that this is where

722
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,360
going and they take that this is where
 

723
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,789
going and they take that this is where
that UK would be if that had the

724
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
that UK would be if that had the
 

725
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,630
that UK would be if that had the
mechanical advantage to do that to them

726
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:19,640
mechanical advantage to do that to them
 

727
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,990
mechanical advantage to do that to them
okay they wouldn't go Topsy Turvy

728
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
okay they wouldn't go Topsy Turvy
 

729
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,230
okay they wouldn't go Topsy Turvy
because that would be agency okay

730
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,240

 

731
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,870

likewise in uh number 11 uh the Wasa has

732
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
likewise in uh number 11 uh the Wasa has
 

733
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,510
likewise in uh number 11 uh the Wasa has
to be cor correct again that also means

734
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:40,520
to be cor correct again that also means
 

735
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,630
to be cor correct again that also means
no Yong Yong clashing but it also

736
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
no Yong Yong clashing but it also
 

737
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,149
no Yong Yong clashing but it also
means that if you generated a Topsy

738
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:48,159
means that if you generated a Topsy
 

739
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,950
means that if you generated a Topsy
Turvy effect you actually had control of

740
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
Turvy effect you actually had control of
 

741
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,029
Turvy effect you actually had control of
the two Direct Control of the two distal

742
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:54,039
the two Direct Control of the two distal
 

743
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,909
the two Direct Control of the two distal
ends of the lever of the spine you have

744
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
ends of the lever of the spine you have
 

745
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,390
ends of the lever of the spine you have
to do that uh but it also means

746
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,400
to do that uh but it also means
 

747
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,630
to do that uh but it also means
where do your control points go in that

748
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:03,640
where do your control points go in that
 

749
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,310
where do your control points go in that
technique okay so for

750
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
technique okay so for
 

751
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,390
technique okay so for
example

752
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
example
 

753
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,110
example
um I am going to do a k Ash okay and I'm

754
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,120
um I am going to do a k Ash okay and I'm
 

755
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,870
um I am going to do a k Ash okay and I'm
not going to do K like this CU that's

756
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:17,880
not going to do K like this CU that's
 

757
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,190
not going to do K like this CU that's
it's not fingernail technique okay

758
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,200
it's not fingernail technique okay
 

759
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,950
it's not fingernail technique okay
that's not how I was taught so I don't

760
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:21,960
that's not how I was taught so I don't
 

761
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,870
that's not how I was taught so I don't
do it that way likewise I'm not going to

762
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
do it that way likewise I'm not going to
 

763
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,470
do it that way likewise I'm not going to
be in the wrist

764
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
be in the wrist
 

765
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,149
be in the wrist
either because I'm supposed to be in the

766
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:29,159
either because I'm supposed to be in the

elbow right does that make sense or I'm

768
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:32,760
elbow right does that make sense or I'm
 

769
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,350
elbow right does that make sense or I'm
going to do um ID but I'm over here like

770
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,360
going to do um ID but I'm over here like
 

771
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,270

777
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,590
control Point goes that's wrong uh
usually when I see that I just call it

these two cuz they're a little hard to

788
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:01,159
these two cuz they're a little hard to
 

789
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,549
these two cuz they're a little hard to
understand and we'll go to the last

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
generate um your momentum throws that's
 

797
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,070
generate um your momentum throws that's
going to fall under um ukia probably

798
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,080
going to fall under um ukia probably
 

799
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,950
going to fall under um ukia probably
sought energy if they took that forward

800
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960

actually generate the Topsy Turvy effect
 

807
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,390
actually generate the Topsy Turvy effect
um and you're probably going to force

808
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,400
um and you're probably going to force
 

809
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,070
um and you're probably going to force
the technique if you're trying to uh

over accelerate the UK so that they fall
 

813
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,269
over accelerate the UK so that they fall
in their cou net or what have you okay

814
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:39,279
in their cou net or what have you okay
 

815
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,950
in their cou net or what have you okay
you instead just use that

816
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:41,960
you instead just use that
 

817
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,230
you instead just use that
inertia um don't look to speed it up and

818
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
inertia um don't look to speed it up and
 

819
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,230
inertia um don't look to speed it up and
obviously don't look to slow it down

820
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
obviously don't look to slow it down
 

821
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,350
obviously don't look to slow it down
because you're probably going to stop

822
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
because you're probably going to stop
 

823
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,990
because you're probably going to stop
the UK that's incorrect except what is

824
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,000
the UK that's incorrect except what is
 

825
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,190
the UK that's incorrect except what is
actually there don't try to change it

826
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,200
actually there don't try to change it
 

827
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,870
actually there don't try to change it
okay all right these two do not pick the

828
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:01,880
okay all right these two do not pick the
 

829
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,390
okay all right these two do not pick the
technique so as I mentioned at the

830
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
technique so as I mentioned at the
 

831
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,750
technique so as I mentioned at the
beginning uh picking the

832
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:06,760
beginning uh picking the
 

833
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,669
beginning uh picking the
technique has just ego tripartite

834
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:10,679
technique has just ego tripartite
 

835
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,350
technique has just ego tripartite
functioning I am not in the moment uh I

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,480
control what's happening uh which means
 

843
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,350

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:27,720
means I'm abiding in the darkness and
 

847
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,590

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:30,600
the delusion of s okay so I'm not
 

849
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,630
the delusion of s okay so I'm not
picking

850
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,640
picking
 

851
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,630
picking
techniques

852
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:33,640
techniques
 

853
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,950
techniques
eventually um I have a feeling that as

854
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
eventually um I have a feeling that as
 

855
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,390
eventually um I have a feeling that as
you guys try to do this it's going to

856
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
you guys try to do this it's going to
 

857
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,789
you guys try to do this it's going to
work fine you're going to go I'm picking

858
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:43,799
work fine you're going to go I'm picking
 

859
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,549
work fine you're going to go I'm picking
a

860
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
a
 

861
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,549
a
technique uh and I was able to take them

862
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:47,559
technique uh and I was able to take them
 

863
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,110
technique uh and I was able to take them
into the technique and that's Gaza again

864
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,120
into the technique and that's Gaza again
 

865
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,789
into the technique and that's Gaza again
it is not it's working because your UK

866
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
it is not it's working because your UK
 

867
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,630
it is not it's working because your UK
is seeking agency they try to identify

868
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:57,640
is seeking agency they try to identify
 

869
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,350
is seeking agency they try to identify
which technique you're doing and they

870
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
which technique you're doing and they
 

871
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,070
which technique you're doing and they
move their body to give you the opening

872
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
move their body to give you the opening
 

873
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,430
move their body to give you the opening
to make it seem like the technique is

874
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
to make it seem like the technique is
 

875
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,830
to make it seem like the technique is
being performed correctly and it's being

876
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
being performed correctly and it's being
 

877
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,830
being performed correctly and it's being
for performed effortlessly okay but it's

878
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
for performed effortlessly okay but it's
 

879
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,269
for performed effortlessly okay but it's
not eventually your ukia is going to get

880
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:15,279
not eventually your ukia is going to get
 

881
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,510
not eventually your ukia is going to get
a hold of the rules and go I just come

882
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
a hold of the rules and go I just come
 

883
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,149
a hold of the rules and go I just come
in and what happens happens

884
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:21,159
in and what happens happens
 

885
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,070
in and what happens happens
okay um and you're going to end up with

886
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
okay um and you're going to end up with
 

887
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,950
okay um and you're going to end up with
like Sean was ending up in the video

888
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:27,960
like Sean was ending up in the video
 

889
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,789
like Sean was ending up in the video
where he's pulling uh A's head down and

890
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:31,799
where he's pulling uh A's head down and
 

891
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,909
where he's pulling uh A's head down and
A's head went down and now it's not

892
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
A's head went down and now it's not
 

893
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,710
A's head went down and now it's not
going to come back up so now you're not

894
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:35,720
going to come back up so now you're not
 

895
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,510
going to come back up so now you're not
going to do any of the back inward or

896
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:38,520
going to do any of the back inward or
 

897
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,269
going to do any of the back inward or
outward kazushi patterns it's not going

898
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:40,279
outward kazushi patterns it's not going
 

899
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:44,990
outward kazushi patterns it's not going
to work okay and if you never get

900
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,000
to work okay and if you never get
 

901
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,430
to work okay and if you never get
there then when you come here you will

902
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,440
there then when you come here you will
 

903
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,750
there then when you come here you will
get there because our ukz will do that

904
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:50,760
get there because our ukz will do that
 

905
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,230

to you okay we will do that to you and a
good way of looking at it was the

908
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
good way of looking at it was the
 

909
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,510
good way of looking at it was the
difference of how how Taylor was the UK

910
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:00,520
difference of how how Taylor was the UK
 

911
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,789
difference of how how Taylor was the UK
for aush in that video versus how sha

912
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:03,799
for aush in that video versus how sha
 

913
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,630
for aush in that video versus how sha
and Maya were UK for each other in that

914
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
and Maya were UK for each other in that
 

915
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,149
and Maya were UK for each other in that
video and I mentioned that with a

916
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:09,159
video and I mentioned that with a
 

917
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,110
video and I mentioned that with a
subtitle okay so check that out um we're

918
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
subtitle okay so check that out um we're
 

919
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,269
subtitle okay so check that out um we're
not picking a technique there's I'm not

920
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:16,279
not picking a technique there's I'm not
 

921
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,510
not picking a technique there's I'm not
picking it beforehand there's no way I'm

922
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,520
picking it beforehand there's no way I'm
 

923
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,750
picking it beforehand there's no way I'm
picking it beforehand

924
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760

 

925
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,430

so what we're doing is when we're here I

926
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,440
so what we're doing is when we're here I
 

927
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,029
so what we're doing is when we're here I
I am not going

928
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039

 

929
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,389

into tensi Nugget for example so pay

930
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:36,399
into tensi Nugget for example so pay
 

931
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,750
into tensi Nugget for example so pay
attention he came in and I and I went

932
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
attention he came in and I and I went
 

933
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,909
attention he came in and I and I went
like that you see that okay so I haven't

934
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
like that you see that okay so I haven't
 

935
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,070
like that you see that okay so I haven't
yet felt his energy do you see that

936
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
yet felt his energy do you see that
 

937
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,190
yet felt his energy do you see that
okay what was I prescribed to do grabb

938
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,200
okay what was I prescribed to do grabb
 

939
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,230
okay what was I prescribed to do grabb
your two wrist okay so you're going to

940
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
your two wrist okay so you're going to
 

941
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,549
your two wrist okay so you're going to
do that movement

942
00:24:59,549 --> 00:24:59,559
do that movement
 

943
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,110
do that movement
before right you got to do it before you

944
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,120
before right you got to do it before you
 

945
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,430
before right you got to do it before you
pick it

946
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
pick it
 

947
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,510
pick it
okay that that's what this UK should do

948
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,520
okay that that's what this UK should do
 

949
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,950
okay that that's what this UK should do
does that make sense UK doesn't go

950
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
does that make sense UK doesn't go
 

951
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,990
does that make sense UK doesn't go
here for this

952
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
here for this
 

953
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,710
here for this
thing the UK comes in he gets the wrist

954
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:19,720
thing the UK comes in he gets the wrist
 

955
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,350
thing the UK comes in he gets the wrist
this is what that looks like now

956
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,360
this is what that looks like now
 

957
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,070
this is what that looks like now
okay so I can't be ahead where I get

958
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,080
okay so I can't be ahead where I get
 

959
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,029
okay so I can't be ahead where I get
here there is just I touch the wrist

960
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
here there is just I touch the wrist
 

961
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,990
here there is just I touch the wrist
okay and you see that's not the

962
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,000
okay and you see that's not the
 

963
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,830
okay and you see that's not the
technique now and the only way to do it

964
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
technique now and the only way to do it
 

965
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,190
technique now and the only way to do it
is I got to do something not real two

966
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:38,200
is I got to do something not real two
 

967
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,190
is I got to do something not real two
steps to one step right that's not real

968
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,200
steps to one step right that's not real
 

969
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,710
steps to one step right that's not real
okay

970
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:43,720
okay
 

971
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,510

972
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
or right I do it again get in that weird
 

973
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,230
or right I do it again get in that weird
position and I start forcing

974
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
position and I start forcing
 

975
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,789
position and I start forcing
it

976
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:51,799
it
 

977
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,669
it
but what happened before that you sto do

978
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
but what happened before that you sto do
 

979
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,830
but what happened before that you sto do
you see so I can't do that t

980
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:58,840
you see so I can't do that t
 

981
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,549
you see so I can't do that t
uh it's going to break one of the other

982
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
uh it's going to break one of the other
 

983
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,269
uh it's going to break one of the other
rules sooner or later as long as the UK

984
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
rules sooner or later as long as the UK
 

985
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,950
rules sooner or later as long as the UK
obeys their rules don't seek agency

986
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
obeys their rules don't seek agency
 

987
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,669
obeys their rules don't seek agency
don't give me my technique just do the

988
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
don't give me my technique just do the
 

989
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,269
don't give me my technique just do the
prescription okay um the only way I can

990
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:14,279
prescription okay um the only way I can
 

991
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,470
prescription okay um the only way I can
do this is he touches me and I feel what

992
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
do this is he touches me and I feel what
 

993
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,269
do this is he touches me and I feel what
he's doing so just stay where you are

994
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:22,279
he's doing so just stay where you are
 

995
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,669
he's doing so just stay where you are
this hand has a lot of

00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:24,679
this hand has a lot of
 

997
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,710
this hand has a lot of
energy and it has a slight turn to it in

998
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
energy and it has a slight turn to it in
 

999
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,350
energy and it has a slight turn to it in
other words it's not going this way okay

1000
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,360
other words it's not going this way okay
 

1001
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,669
other words it's not going this way okay
and it has more energy than this hand do

1002
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
and it has more energy than this hand do
 

1003
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,830
and it has more energy than this hand do
you see so I have to use that I know I

1004
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:40,840
you see so I have to use that I know I
 

1005
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,230
you see so I have to use that I know I
can't stop you and I know I can't force

1006
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
can't stop you and I know I can't force
 

1007
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,310
can't stop you and I know I can't force
you right do you get it so I have to use

1008
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,320
you right do you get it so I have to use
 

1009
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,149
you right do you get it so I have to use
that energy there it is and that's what

1010
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
that energy there it is and that's what
 

1011
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,870
that energy there it is and that's what
I use this has a lot of down you wanted

1012
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
I use this has a lot of down you wanted
 

1013
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,789
I use this has a lot of down you wanted
to go back but it had a lot of down so I

1014
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:57,799
to go back but it had a lot of down so I
 

1015
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,510
to go back but it had a lot of down so I
have to use

1016
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
have to use
 

1017
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,510
have to use
that instead okay

1018
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
that instead okay
 

1019
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,750
that instead okay
so if you

1020
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760

 

1021
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,669

are moving before

1022
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:14,679
are moving before
 

1023
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,190
are moving before
touched you're

1024
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
touched you're
 

1025
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,750
touched you're
picking if your UK is

1026
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:20,760
picking if your UK is
 

1027
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,510
picking if your UK is
moving to get you where you need to be

1028
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:24,520
moving to get you where you need to be
 

1029
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,470
moving to get you where you need to be
you're picking because there was nothing

1030
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
you're picking because there was nothing
 

1031
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,190
you're picking because there was nothing
wrong with where the UK was was okay the

1032
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,200
wrong with where the UK was was okay the
 

1033
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,870
wrong with where the UK was was okay the
only reason he had to move back is

1034
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
only reason he had to move back is
 

1035
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,549
only reason he had to move back is
because I wanted his head to go back

1036
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:35,559
because I wanted his head to go back
 

1037
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,669
because I wanted his head to go back
instead of where was his head going

1038
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
instead of where was his head going
 

1039
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,669
instead of where was his head going
instead do you see you'll break all

1040
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:40,679
instead do you see you'll break all
 

1041
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,470
instead do you see you'll break all
kinds of rules as you start picking but

1042
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
kinds of rules as you start picking but
 

1043
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,750
kinds of rules as you start picking but

1056
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:03,960
you had the right answer they're going
 

1057

but if you play long enough with this

1062
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
but if you play long enough with this
 

1063
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,509
but if you play long enough with this
you too will be able to tell okay

1064
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:16,519
you too will be able to tell okay
 

1065
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,029

just work with the energy that's

1076
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:35,720
just work with the energy that's
 

1077
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,630
just work with the energy that's
happening as it's happening okay that's

which is why if you pay

1090
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
which is why if you pay
 

1091
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,350
which is why if you pay
attention uh if you start doing it right

1092
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
attention uh if you start doing it right
 

1093
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,389
attention uh if you start doing it right
you'll almost never do Kona you'll

1094
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
you'll almost never do Kona you'll
 

1095
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,630
you'll almost never do Kona you'll
almost never do it you you'll also have

1096
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:09,640
almost never do it you you'll also have
 

1097
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,590
almost never do it you you'll also have
techniques that you won't remember which

1098
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:12,600
techniques that you won't remember which
 

1099
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,350
techniques that you won't remember which
ones you did uh you will have never done

1100
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
ones you did uh you will have never done
 

1101
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,149
ones you did uh you will have never done
them before you will not uh ever do them

1102
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:19,159
them before you will not uh ever do them
 

1103
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,110
them before you will not uh ever do them
again probably okay now and that is

1104
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,120
again probably okay now and that is
 

1105
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,350
again probably okay now and that is
entirely different from I'm picking my

1106
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,360
entirely different from I'm picking my
 

1107
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,950
entirely different from I'm picking my
techniques and I'm just trying to be

1108
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:25,960
techniques and I'm just trying to be
 

1109
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,590
techniques and I'm just trying to be
spontaneous with my techniques that's

1110
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:28,600
spontaneous with my techniques that's
 

1111
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,669
spontaneous with my techniques that's
not being spontaneous with techniques

1112
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:30,679
not being spontaneous with techniques
 

1113
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,350
not being spontaneous with techniques
that's just thinking real fast with the

1114
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,360
that's just thinking real fast with the
 

1115
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,590
that's just thinking real fast with the
ego tripartite mind okay that's

1116
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:34,600
ego tripartite mind okay that's
 

1117
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,990
ego tripartite mind okay that's
something entirely different so uh one

1118
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
something entirely different so uh one
 

1119
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,950
something entirely different so uh one
of the techniques that uh I didn't

1120
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
of the techniques that uh I didn't
 

1121
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,950
of the techniques that uh I didn't
really understand how I did it I don't

1122
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
really understand how I did it I don't
 

1123
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,870
really understand how I did it I don't
even know how I could get in it right

1124
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
even know how I could get in it right
 

1125
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,710
even know how I could get in it right
now to tell you the truth um let's see I

1126
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
now to tell you the truth um let's see I
 

1127
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,269
now to tell you the truth um let's see I
think it was in the block of the video

1128
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:52,279
think it was in the block of the video
 

1129
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,590
think it was in the block of the video
where I was showing the mistake of

1130
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
where I was showing the mistake of
 

1131
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,590
where I was showing the mistake of
turning a us here you remember that one

1132
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:00,600
turning a us here you remember that one
 

1133
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,669
turning a us here you remember that one
okay and I was all like well when he

1134
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
okay and I was all like well when he
 

1135
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,590
okay and I was all like well when he
turns then their technique is

1136
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:06,600
turns then their technique is
 

1137
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,909
turns then their technique is
here and that's there's no Keyon W on

1138
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:09,919
here and that's there's no Keyon W on
 

1139
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,549
here and that's there's no Keyon W on
that there's no technique like that

1140
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
that there's no technique like that
 

1141
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,470
that there's no technique like that
we've never done that um you're not

1142
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
we've never done that um you're not
 

1143
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,389
we've never done that um you're not
picking techniques you're transcending

1144
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:19,399
picking techniques you're transcending
 

1145
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,269
picking techniques you're transcending
form you're reconciling form and non

1146
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:22,279
form you're reconciling form and non
 

1147
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,070
form you're reconciling form and non
form and that's not a matter of picking

1148
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
form and that's not a matter of picking
 

1149
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,630
form and that's not a matter of picking
techniques or trying to do techniques or

1150
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:27,640
techniques or trying to do techniques or
 

1151
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,430
techniques or trying to do techniques or
even trying to be spontaneous with

1152
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:30,440
even trying to be spontaneous with
 

1153
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,350
even trying to be spontaneous with
techniques you're trying to transcend

1154
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
techniques you're trying to transcend
 

1155
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,430
techniques you're trying to transcend
the dichotomy of form and non form if we

1156
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:36,440
the dichotomy of form and non form if we
 

1157
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,389
the dichotomy of form and non form if we
use the word transcendence or

1158
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:39,399
use the word transcendence or
 

1159
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:42,669
use the word transcendence or
spontaneous you're spontaneous with the

1160
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:42,679
spontaneous you're spontaneous with the
 

1161
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,909
spontaneous you're spontaneous with the
art not not like EO or no

1162
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:48,919
art not not like EO or no
 

1163
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,870
art not not like EO or no
everything that is EO would have to be

1164
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
everything that is EO would have to be
 

1165
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,830
everything that is EO would have to be
justified in the guaza training for it

1166
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:56,840
justified in the guaza training for it
 

1167
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,990
justified in the guaza training for it
to be EO

1168
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,000
to be EO
 

1169
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,110
to be EO
um so for

1170
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
um so for
 

1171
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,629
um so for
example uh I say I'm going to do this

1172
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:03,639
example uh I say I'm going to do this
 

1173
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,590
example uh I say I'm going to do this
one right I have to be able to feel that

1174
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:08,600
one right I have to be able to feel that
 

1175
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,710
one right I have to be able to feel that
I don't I will not be able to get his

1176
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
I don't I will not be able to get his
 

1177
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,870
I don't I will not be able to get his
Center like he there has to be weight on

1178
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:13,880
Center like he there has to be weight on
 

1179
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,470
Center like he there has to be weight on
that you get what I'm saying so that I

1180
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
that you get what I'm saying so that I
 

1181
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,710
that you get what I'm saying so that I
would attack the

1182
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:19,720

 

1183
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,950

arm and as as I attack the arm there has

1184
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:23,960
arm and as as I attack the arm there has
 

1185
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,389
arm and as as I attack the arm there has
to be weight here too because if it's

1186
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:27,399
to be weight here too because if it's
 

1187
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,549
to be weight here too because if it's
limp

1188
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
limp
 

1189
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,310
limp
just limp go limp and I'll just kick him

1190
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,320
just limp go limp and I'll just kick him
 

1191
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,509
just limp go limp and I'll just kick him
in the face because it has to be

1192
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,519
in the face because it has to be
 

1193
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,789
in the face because it has to be
real having being here on a limp arm and

1194
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
real having being here on a limp arm and
 

1195
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,029
real having being here on a limp arm and
trying to be limp and trying to get this

1196
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
trying to be limp and trying to get this
 

1197
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,470
trying to be limp and trying to get this
arm is not real okay this is real

1198
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
arm is not real okay this is real
 

1199
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,950
arm is not real okay this is real
technique over right and then when I get

1200
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:45,960
technique over right and then when I get
 

1201
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,190
technique over right and then when I get
down to the end if I get down there I

1202
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
down to the end if I get down there I
 

1203
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,870
down to the end if I get down there I
can't do that stupid pin because it's

1204
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:51,880
can't do that stupid pin because it's
 

1205
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,350
can't do that stupid pin because it's
not a real pin so I have to figure out

1206
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:54,360
not a real pin so I have to figure out
 

1207
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,629
not a real pin so I have to figure out
what I'm going to do

1208
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:55,639
what I'm going to do
 

1209
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,190
what I'm going to do
instead right

1210
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
instead right
 

1211
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,070
instead right
I'll never do EO in Gaza there's very

1212
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,080
I'll never do EO in Gaza there's very
 

1213
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,190
I'll never do EO in Gaza there's very
very few techniques that I do so take

1214
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
very few techniques that I do so take
 

1215
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,070
very few techniques that I do so take
for

1216
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
for
 

1217
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,750
for
example another one

1218
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
example another one
 

1219
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,389
example another one
was um I was demonstrating to Virginia

1220
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
was um I was demonstrating to Virginia
 

1221
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,310
was um I was demonstrating to Virginia
that if you're going to do the tenom

1222
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
that if you're going to do the tenom
 

1223
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,230
that if you're going to do the tenom
version of iag you don't tilt the head

1224
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
version of iag you don't tilt the head
 

1225
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,549
version of iag you don't tilt the head
that's incorrect this has to go through

1226
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
that's incorrect this has to go through
 

1227
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,470
that's incorrect this has to go through
the

1228
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
the
 

1229
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,070
the
spine and then he has to come up well

1230
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
spine and then he has to come up well
 

1231
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,509
spine and then he has to come up well
now it's kind of

1232
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
now it's kind of
 

1233
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,149
now it's kind of
goofy right if he's

1234
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:33,159
goofy right if he's
 

1235
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,870
goofy right if he's
down I should come in here and do my

1236
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:35,880
down I should come in here and do my
 

1237
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,029
down I should come in here and do my
stuff from here that's where I should go

1238
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
stuff from here that's where I should go
 

1239
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,470
stuff from here that's where I should go
I don't want to

1240
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
I don't want to
 

1241
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,629
I don't want to
pick techniques let alone those

ahead of time time we're trying to free
ourselves from form not just pick form

ourselves from form not just pick form
 

1257

ourselves from form not just pick form
and do them quickly
