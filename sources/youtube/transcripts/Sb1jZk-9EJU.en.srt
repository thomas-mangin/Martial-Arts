00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,210

all right it's it looks much easier but

99
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,220
all right it's it looks much easier but
 

100
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,770
all right it's it looks much easier but
I'll show you where there's some

101

I'll show you where there's some
 

102
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,190
I'll show you where there's some
differences okay so on the first one my

103
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
differences okay so on the first one my
 

104
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,630
differences okay so on the first one my
hand should be the same

105
