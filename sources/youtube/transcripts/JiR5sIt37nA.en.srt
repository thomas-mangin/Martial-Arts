00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
i can't reach him with my leg without
 

171
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,189
i can't reach him with my leg without
taking a step right

172
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
taking a step right
 

173
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,270
taking a step right
now the reason that's important is

174
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
now the reason that's important is
 

175
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,230
now the reason that's important is
because if

176
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
because if
 

177
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,150
because if
i take a step it gives him enough

178
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
i take a step it gives him enough
 

179
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,990
i take a step it gives him enough
reaction time that he could probably

180
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
reaction time that he could probably
 

181
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,070
reaction time that he could probably
get out of the way or defend himself

182
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
get out of the way or defend himself
 

183
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,070
get out of the way or defend himself
right so meaning if he sees me take a

184
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
right so meaning if he sees me take a
 

185
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,590
right so meaning if he sees me take a
step he could take a counter step and

186
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
step he could take a counter step and
 

187
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,189
step he could take a counter step and
get out of the way of that right

188
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
get out of the way of that right
 

189
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,670
get out of the way of that right
now if i'm in really close on this guy i

190
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
now if i'm in really close on this guy i
 

191
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,270
now if i'm in really close on this guy i
can probably do something so

192
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
can probably do something so
 

193
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,350
can probably do something so
fast that he won't have reaction time to

194
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
fast that he won't have reaction time to
 

195
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,110
fast that he won't have reaction time to
it right so meaning for this close i

196
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
it right so meaning for this close i
 

197
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,629
it right so meaning for this close i
could just move my arm and hit him

198
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
could just move my arm and hit him
 

199
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,629
could just move my arm and hit him
that's very very little reaction time he

200
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
that's very very little reaction time he
 

201
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,390
that's very very little reaction time he
has to realize i'm hitting him and then

202
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
has to realize i'm hitting him and then
 

203
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,150
has to realize i'm hitting him and then
bring his arm up to hit me right

204
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
bring his arm up to hit me right
 

205
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,909
bring his arm up to hit me right
maybe move his body but he would have to

206
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
maybe move his body but he would have to
 

207
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,189
maybe move his body but he would have to
be able to move his body pretty fast

208
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
be able to move his body pretty fast
 

209
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,629
be able to move his body pretty fast
because i can move my hand real fast

210
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
because i can move my hand real fast
 

211
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,310
because i can move my hand real fast
or take a step and take the steps really

212
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
or take a step and take the steps really
 

213
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,469
or take a step and take the steps really
slow so at this range it's very likely

214
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
slow so at this range it's very likely
 

215
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,670
slow so at this range it's very likely
that i'm going to get him at least

216
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
that i'm going to get him at least
 

217
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,830
that i'm going to get him at least
once before he has some kind of reaction

218
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
once before he has some kind of reaction
 

219
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,870
once before he has some kind of reaction
to that okay

220
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
to that okay
 

221
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,830
to that okay
now if we go to say a long a long weapon

222
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
now if we go to say a long a long weapon
 

223
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,749
now if we go to say a long a long weapon
let's say to a really long weapon okay

224
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
let's say to a really long weapon okay
 

225
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,590
let's say to a really long weapon okay
so he's got this if he reaches out with

226
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
so he's got this if he reaches out with
 

227
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,510
so he's got this if he reaches out with
this we check on my eye so here's where

228
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
this we check on my eye so here's where
 

229
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,550
this we check on my eye so here's where
the my eye would be

230
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
the my eye would be
 

231
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,870
the my eye would be
with this long weapon all right now if

232
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
with this long weapon all right now if
 

233
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,390
with this long weapon all right now if
he just hold that down to your side for

234
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
he just hold that down to your side for
 

235
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,629
he just hold that down to your side for
a second okay now here's our old my eye

236
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
a second okay now here's our old my eye
 

237
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,629
a second okay now here's our old my eye
here's our old mai right here okay and

238
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
here's our old mai right here okay and
 

239
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,870
here's our old mai right here okay and
now our new eye

240
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
now our new eye
 

241
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,430
now our new eye
is here so this means before i can touch

242
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440

which means josh is going to get one

258
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
which means josh is going to get one
 

259
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,790
which means josh is going to get one
free shot

260
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
free shot
 

261
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,870
free shot
on me before i can break down the

262
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
on me before i can break down the
 

263
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,790
on me before i can break down the
distance to get a hold of him

264
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
distance to get a hold of him
 

265
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,510
distance to get a hold of him
right so that length is super super

266
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
right so that length is super super
 

267
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,070
right so that length is super super
important

268
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
important
 

269
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,070
important
now of course as the weapon gets smaller

270
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
now of course as the weapon gets smaller
 

271
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,230
now of course as the weapon gets smaller
that advantage gets smaller and smaller

272
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
that advantage gets smaller and smaller
 

273
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,790
that advantage gets smaller and smaller
as well

274
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
as well
 

275
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,550
as well
but at this with something like this

276
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
but at this with something like this
 

277
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,990
but at this with something like this
length so a sword which is maybe

278
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
length so a sword which is maybe
 

279
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,469
length so a sword which is maybe
something

280
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
something
 

281
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,909
something
back in the day that guys thought a lot

282
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
back in the day that guys thought a lot
 

283
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,990
back in the day that guys thought a lot
about having right that means that i

284
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
about having right that means that i
 

285
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,309
about having right that means that i
can't possibly get josh without taking

286
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
can't possibly get josh without taking
 

287
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,350
can't possibly get josh without taking
one more step and yet josh can get me so

288
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
one more step and yet josh can get me so
 

289
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,110
one more step and yet josh can get me so
if josh maintains his ma

290
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
if josh maintains his ma
 

291
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,710
if josh maintains his ma
i this i have to take two steps to get

292
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
i this i have to take two steps to get
 

293
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,909
i this i have to take two steps to get
josh

294
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
josh
 

295
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,029
josh
one i'm now in josh's danger zone still

296
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
one i'm now in josh's danger zone still
 

297
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,150
one i'm now in josh's danger zone still
can't get him still can't kick him two

298
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
can't get him still can't kick him two
 

299
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,469
can't get him still can't kick him two
and now finally i can get josh so i'm

300
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
and now finally i can get josh so i'm
 

301
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,189
and now finally i can get josh so i'm
going to give him

302
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
going to give him
 

303
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,990
going to give him
two beats of time in which he can hit me

304
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
two beats of time in which he can hit me
 

305
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,950
two beats of time in which he can hit me
and also

306
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
and also
 

307
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,189
and also
two beats of time which he can escape

308
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
two beats of time which he can escape
 

309
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,990
two beats of time which he can escape
from right

310
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
from right
 

311
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,150
from right
so if we're in our small my eye and i go

312
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
so if we're in our small my eye and i go
 

313
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,150
so if we're in our small my eye and i go
to get him he's just one steps all he

314
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
to get him he's just one steps all he
 

315
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,230
to get him he's just one steps all he
gets but with a longer weapon he gets

316
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
gets but with a longer weapon he gets
 

317
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,590
gets but with a longer weapon he gets
two steps so even if the weapon is not

318
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
two steps so even if the weapon is not
 

319
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,590
two steps so even if the weapon is not
um that dangerous to the other person

320
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
um that dangerous to the other person
 

321
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,830
um that dangerous to the other person
attacking it's still going to give you

322
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
attacking it's still going to give you
 

323
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,230
attacking it's still going to give you
more time and more attack potential

324
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
more time and more attack potential
 

325
00:06:48,240 --> 00:07:04,620
more time and more attack potential
for them to cover that distance

326
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:04,630

 

327
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:28,830

[Music]

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,550
all right guys so um that was what it
looks like with three different weapons

334
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
looks like with three different weapons
 

335
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,350
looks like with three different weapons
so

336
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
so
 

337
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,670

understand that that weapon is foam all
 

339
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,029
understand that that weapon is foam all
three of those weapons were foam

340
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
three of those weapons were foam
 

341
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,510
three of those weapons were foam
so there is natural flinch reaction

342
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
so there is natural flinch reaction
 

343
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,790
so there is natural flinch reaction
right so you could see especially the

is not ideal but that's might what have

422
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
is not ideal but that's might what have
 

423
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,269
is not ideal but that's might what have
to happen you're going to

424
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
to happen you're going to
 

425
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,790
to happen you're going to
make an escape so you get away from that

426
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
make an escape so you get away from that

happening right
 

433
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,470
happening right
so those those are different ways that

434
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
so those those are different ways that
