179
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,389
we're not it's not that we're doing this
he be he's coming in at me do you see

180
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
he be he's coming in at me do you see
 

181
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,430
he be he's coming in at me do you see
you get it there's a rotation so there's

182
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
you get it there's a rotation so there's
 

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,350
you get it there's a rotation so there's
a centrifugal and a cental energy

184
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,360
a centrifugal and a cental energy
 

185
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,269
a centrifugal and a cental energy
because of how where I move so I'm not

186
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
because of how where I move so I'm not
 

187
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,230
because of how where I move so I'm not
in other words as I throws the strike

188
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
in other words as I throws the strike
 

189
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,350
in other words as I throws the strike
I'm not going to go to the 45 and not

190
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
I'm not going to go to the 45 and not
 

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,710
I'm not going to go to the 45 and not
there's no rotation you see that I have

192
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
there's no rotation you see that I have
 

193
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,790
there's no rotation you see that I have
to move to the 45 to keep this thing

194
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:13,800
to move to the 45 to keep this thing
 

195
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,310
to move to the 45 to keep this thing
going so this time in order to keep it

196
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
going so this time in order to keep it
 

197
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,030
going so this time in order to keep it
going I had to go to the other 45 to

198
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
going I had to go to the other 45 to
 

199
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,110
going I had to go to the other 45 to
keep it going okay you guys understand

200
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
keep it going okay you guys understand
 

201
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,230
keep it going okay you guys understand
so that force is happening to us now

202
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
so that force is happening to us now
 

203
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,910
so that force is happening to us now
let's it's hard to talk

204
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
let's it's hard to talk
 

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,150
let's it's hard to talk
and and work with the actual centrifugal

206
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,160
and and work with the actual centrifugal
 

207
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,910
and and work with the actual centrifugal
energy and the cental energy

208
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
energy and the cental energy
 

209
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,310
energy and the cental energy
okay um so for but if we just walk

210
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,320
okay um so for but if we just walk
 

211
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,910
okay um so for but if we just walk
around just walk around normal you're

212
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
around just walk around normal you're
 

213
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,430
around just walk around normal you're
not you're not a Victor like you're

214
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:46,440
not you're not a Victor like you're
 

215
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,150
not you're not a Victor like you're
trying to grab me do you understand

216
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
trying to grab me do you understand
 

217
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,389
trying to grab me do you understand
you're trying to grab me okay if I just

218
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:51,399
you're trying to grab me okay if I just
 

219
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,150
you're trying to grab me okay if I just
keep his spine straight you could do any

220
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
keep his spine straight you could do any
 

221
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,910
keep his spine straight you could do any
number of things not

222
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,920
number of things not
 

223
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,310
number of things not
everything if I was in front of him he

224
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,320
everything if I was in front of him he
 

225
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,190
everything if I was in front of him he
could do everything at the angle he

226
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
could do everything at the angle he
 

227
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,069
could do everything at the angle he
could do more things if we're not moving

228
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
could do more things if we're not moving
 

229
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,030
could do more things if we're not moving
but when we're

230
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
but when we're
 

231
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,110
but when we're
moving he can do less things but still

232
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
moving he can do less things but still
 

233
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,750
moving he can do less things but still
quite a bit okay he can duck under he

234
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,760
quite a bit okay he can duck under he
 

235
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,550
quite a bit okay he can duck under he
can pull he can go around and a lot to

236
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:17,560
can pull he can go around and a lot to
 

237
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,910
can pull he can go around and a lot to
account for so that is why I don't just

238
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:22,920
account for so that is why I don't just
 

239
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,189
account for so that is why I don't just
stick and follow I always

240
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,199
stick and follow I always
 

241
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,629
stick and follow I always
tilt you have to tilt took away a lot of

242
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
tilt you have to tilt took away a lot of
 

243
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,990
tilt you have to tilt took away a lot of
things

244
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,000

 

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,150

okay so he's trying to hit your

246
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
okay so he's trying to hit your
 

247
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,509
okay so he's trying to hit your
chest and you don't want to just stick

248
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
chest and you don't want to just stick
 

249
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,389
chest and you don't want to just stick
you don't want to just hold he's not

250
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:45,399
you don't want to just hold he's not
 

251
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,189
you don't want to just hold he's not
much tilt you have to touch and tilt you

252
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,199
much tilt you have to touch and tilt you
 

253
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,829
much tilt you have to touch and tilt you
see then he has to do something to get

254
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:52,839
see then he has to do something to get
 

255
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,629
see then he has to do something to get
off of it and that's what opens up other

256
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:55,639
off of it and that's what opens up other
 

257
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,310
off of it and that's what opens up other
stuff

258
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,320

tilt where you're going to dis
 

263
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,069
tilt where you're going to dis
project but you should you have to

264
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
project but you should you have to
 

265
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,550
project but you should you have to
occupy with the Tilt every time he has

266
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:11,560
occupy with the Tilt every time he has
 

267
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,230
occupy with the Tilt every time he has
to get off of the

268
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,240

 

269
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,030

Tilt so not like this I know you can do

270
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
Tilt so not like this I know you can do
 

271
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,629
Tilt so not like this I know you can do
this but it's not what we do okay touch

Tilt see okay but I have to tilt you can
me pushes right you can yield you see i

294
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
me pushes right you can yield you see i
 

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,069
me pushes right you can yield you see i
y I got out of the way and then you can

296
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,079
y I got out of the way and then you can
 

297
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:21,760
y I got out of the way and then you can
pick

okay um also
remember mid-range grappling like I said

312
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:45,959
remember mid-range grappling like I said
 

313
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,910
remember mid-range grappling like I said
just now it's

314
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
just now it's
 

315
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,470
just now it's
here okay so this is The Edge just like

316
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
here okay so this is The Edge just like
 

317
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,870
here okay so this is The Edge just like
I don't want to use my elbow cuz I'm at

318
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
I don't want to use my elbow cuz I'm at
 

319
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,150
I don't want to use my elbow cuz I'm at
the edge of close range grappling the

320
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
the edge of close range grappling the
 

321
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,230
the edge of close range grappling the
border between the to same thing you get

322
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
border between the to same thing you get
 

323
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,389
border between the to same thing you get
on his elbows you're you're at that edge

324
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
on his elbows you're you're at that edge
 

325
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,389
on his elbows you're you're at that edge
okay so he gets on he gets on my elbows

326
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
okay so he gets on he gets on my elbows

508
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:37,559
circling the F you see that no that
 

509
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,149
circling the F you see that no that
angle's gone that angle's gone you see

510
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
angle's gone that angle's gone you see
 

511
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,070
angle's gone that angle's gone you see
you get it okay and you by circling I

512
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,080
you get it okay and you by circling I
 

513
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,750
you get it okay and you by circling I
now become reaction you stay here I'm

514
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:48,760
now become reaction you stay here I'm
 

515
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,789
now become reaction you stay here I'm
active you start circling I got to

516
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:51,799
active you start circling I got to
 

517
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,549
active you start circling I got to
enough turn you see so I lose initiative

518
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
enough turn you see so I lose initiative
 

519
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,669
enough turn you see so I lose initiative
you start cutting away some of my

520
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:58,679
you start cutting away some of my
 

521
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,630
you start cutting away some of my
potential angles of attack it's easier

522
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,640
potential angles of attack it's easier
 

523
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,070
potential angles of attack it's easier
to now defend yourself okay the

524
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
to now defend yourself okay the
 

525
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,909
to now defend yourself okay the
more I am away from one of the kazushi

526
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
more I am away from one of the kazushi
 

527
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,750
more I am away from one of the kazushi
patterns and you are away from one of

528
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
patterns and you are away from one of
 

529
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,789
patterns and you are away from one of
the shikaku

530
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:15,799
the shikaku
 

531
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,990
the shikaku
angles it's just a matter of time I'm

532
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,000
angles it's just a matter of time I'm
 

533
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,590
angles it's just a matter of time I'm
going to get you okay so that is

534
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
going to get you okay so that is
 

535
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,830
going to get you okay so that is
why when you're here like this she she

536
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:26,840
why when you're here like this she she
 

537
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,390
why when you're here like this she she
can do she has single angle and

538
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
can do she has single angle and
 

539
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,510
can do she has single angle and
combination so if you Pi she can make

540
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
combination so if you Pi she can make
 

541
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,269
combination so if you Pi she can make
every one of those 360s coming around

542
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:36,279
every one of those 360s coming around
 

543
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,669
every one of those 360s coming around
see okay she can go this way too and

544
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
see okay she can go this way too and
 

545
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,190
see okay she can go this way too and
this way she can do the diagonals you

546
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,200
this way she can do the diagonals you
 

547
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,149

with that it's like it's just a matter
 

551
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,390
with that it's like it's just a matter
of time okay so again the order is not

552
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
of time okay so again the order is not
 

553
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,110
of time okay so again the order is not
to be here

554

thing
so hard to do she look how much angles

584
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:44,679
so hard to do she look how much angles
 

585
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:45,870
so hard to do she look how much angles
that I have to

586

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,559
okay but what you do instead the order
 

595
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,029
okay but what you do instead the order
of operation is I touch

596
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:00,039
of operation is I touch
 

597
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:05,830
of operation is I touch
sees okay wear's her y energy

598
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
sees okay wear's her y energy
 

599

deviate right and start to tilt she'll

600
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
deviate right and start to tilt she'll
 

601
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,149

way you see so let's go back here we're

604
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
way you see so let's go back here we're
 

605
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,830
way you see so let's go back here we're
around this tilt and try to come around

606
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
around this tilt and try to come around
 

607
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,070
around this tilt and try to come around
the outside of this arm BR is bringing

608
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,080
the outside of this arm BR is bringing
 

609
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,029
the outside of this arm BR is bringing
her more into it so she would feel that

610
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:26,039
her more into it so she would feel that
 

611
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,310
her more into it so she would feel that
and any athlete would feel that that's

612
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
and any athlete would feel that that's
 

613
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,950
and any athlete would feel that that's
that's why she came around to the other

614
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:29,960
that's why she came around to the other
 

615
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,590
that's why she came around to the other
arm she's trying to flee the other arm

616
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:32,600
arm she's trying to flee the other arm
 

617
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,269
arm she's trying to flee the other arm
that's getting her but you keep now able

618
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
that's getting her but you keep now able
 

619
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,909
that's getting her but you keep now able
to keep using those little tiny angles I

620
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
to keep using those little tiny angles I
 

621
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,870
to keep using those little tiny angles I
don't know if the camera can see

622
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:41,880
don't know if the camera can see
 

623
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,350
don't know if the camera can see
it okay so here's the here's the seizure

624
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:46,360
it okay so here's the here's the seizure
 

625
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,230
it okay so here's the here's the seizure
right so let's say there's your Center

626
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,240
right so let's say there's your Center
 

627
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,870
right so let's say there's your Center
but I don't keep it in the Tilt she can

628
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:51,880
but I don't keep it in the Tilt she can
 

629
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,630
but I don't keep it in the Tilt she can
RIS roll around and she's free you see

630
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:55,640
RIS roll around and she's free you see
 

631
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,350
RIS roll around and she's free you see
but if I keep pulling and her little rib

632
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,360
but if I keep pulling and her little rib
 

633
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,029
but if I keep pulling and her little rib
this roll doesn't do anything okay so

634
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:02,039
this roll doesn't do anything okay so
 

635
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,590
this roll doesn't do anything okay so
you canceling out angles you guys

636
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:04,600
you canceling out angles you guys
 

637
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,430
you canceling out angles you guys
understand so right at touch you're

638
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,440
understand so right at touch you're
 

639
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,190
understand so right at touch you're
already moving there's little micro

640
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
already moving there's little micro
 

641
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,630

touching her and going but I'm not she's
 

649
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,190
touching her and going but I'm not she's
she's constantly micro adjusting and I'm

650
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
she's constantly micro adjusting and I'm
 

651
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,909
she's constantly micro adjusting and I'm
micro adjusting at the seizure Point

652
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
micro adjusting at the seizure Point
 

653
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,510
micro adjusting at the seizure Point
okay I don't have to move my hand to

654
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:28,520
okay I don't have to move my hand to
 

655
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,430
okay I don't have to move my hand to
adjust at the seizure point so if we if

656
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
adjust at the seizure point so if we if
 

657
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,269
adjust at the seizure point so if we if
we go slow and you agree to stay

658
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:34,279
we go slow and you agree to stay
 

659
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:41,149

off okay got it
so touch seize tilt okay now you now

664
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
so touch seize tilt okay now you now
 

665
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,830
so touch seize tilt okay now you now
you're taking away a lot of possible
