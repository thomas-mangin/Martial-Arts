1
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,510

you know kind of hard

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
you know kind of hard
 

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,870
you know kind of hard
so it's actually

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
so it's actually
 

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,070
so it's actually
it's showing that she's striking

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
it's showing that she's striking
 

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,870
it's showing that she's striking
actually

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880

 

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,269

that's kind of beside the point it's

10
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
that's kind of beside the point it's
 

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,390
that's kind of beside the point it's
basically

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
basically
 

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:38,229
basically
the rising strike here now often

14
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239

 

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,630

is

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640

 

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,630

so i like a bit more

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
so i like a bit more
 

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,750
so i like a bit more
uh

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
uh
 

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,150
uh
decisiveness in the movement because

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
decisiveness in the movement because
 

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,430
decisiveness in the movement because
we're going to intake we do something

24
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
we're going to intake we do something
 

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,790
we're going to intake we do something
called

26
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
called
 

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,310
called
the japanese or parts of the mountain

28
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
the japanese or parts of the mountain
 

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,189
the japanese or parts of the mountain
echo

30
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
echo
 

31
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:07,590
echo
so basically i throw this out

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600

 

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,030

one of the purposes of this technique

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
one of the purposes of this technique
 

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,670
one of the purposes of this technique
did you vanish if you did it right

36
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
did you vanish if you did it right
 

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,950
did you vanish if you did it right
so

38
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
so
 

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,870
so
you know the one thing that saw me they

40
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
you know the one thing that saw me they
 

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,149
you know the one thing that saw me they
were gonna

42
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
were gonna
 

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,149
were gonna
flash in front of you and you've got if

44
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
flash in front of you and you've got if
 

45
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,190
flash in front of you and you've got if
you get

46
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
you get
 

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,550
you get
occasionally you will get this on the

48
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
occasionally you will get this on the
 

49
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,030
occasionally you will get this on the
map as it comes in to enter

50
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
map as it comes in to enter
 

51
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,510
map as it comes in to enter
it's like what the hell you can't

52
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
it's like what the hell you can't
 

53
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,350
it's like what the hell you can't
actually see him

54
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
actually see him
 

55
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,270
actually see him
you know he's somewhere because and then

56
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
you know he's somewhere because and then
 

57
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,230
you know he's somewhere because and then
this

58
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
this
 

59
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,310
this
because he's behind me i can't

60
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
because he's behind me i can't
 

61
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,069
because he's behind me i can't
do anything about flat i can't really

62
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
do anything about flat i can't really
 

63
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,950
do anything about flat i can't really
see

64
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
see
 

65
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:49,910
see
so you need to be right behind

66
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920

 

67
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:05,749

is

68
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759

 

69
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:21,190

like

70
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200

 

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,550

all you've got to do you know it just

72
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
all you've got to do you know it just
 

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,470
all you've got to do you know it just
happens occasionally that's what it's

74
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
happens occasionally that's what it's
 

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,229
happens occasionally that's what it's
kind of full

76
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
kind of full
 

77
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,309
kind of full
so yeah so it comes in you'll make sure

78
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
so yeah so it comes in you'll make sure
 

79
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,470
so yeah so it comes in you'll make sure
you're going deep

80
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
you're going deep
 

81
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,110
you're going deep
okay

82
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120

 

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,830

that's pretty good i can't see

84
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840

 

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,390

this is not really good yeah

86
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
this is not really good yeah
 

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,550
this is not really good yeah
it's too vulnerable

88
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
it's too vulnerable
 

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,910
it's too vulnerable
all kinds of reason you know

90
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920

 

91
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,879

it's a long wave yeah
