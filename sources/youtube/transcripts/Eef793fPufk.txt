this situation let's grab both of my
shoulders i'm going to step off to a new
angle to a 45 degree angle here i'm
going to do that by switching my feet
making a triangle step i have timmy's
face this is all an attempt to get him
to leave me alone i'd like to just hit
him and be free
this is a tough guy so when i make that
movement it doesn't stop him instead of
trying to push back into mike i'm going
to split his arms in two this one's
going to go high this one's going to get
low i'm going to twist into him here
breaking his balance i step behind him
and finish him off with a coke nugget
one more time to speak
out
