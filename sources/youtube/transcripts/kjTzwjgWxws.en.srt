1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,190

and that strategy

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
and that strategy
 

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,910
and that strategy
is reactionary

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
is reactionary
 

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,430
is reactionary
that means that

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
that means that
 

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,470
that means that
you stand there and do that

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
you stand there and do that
 

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,349
you stand there and do that
and he comes to grab and then you do

10
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
and he comes to grab and then you do
 

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,509
and he comes to grab and then you do
your technique

12
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
your technique
 

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,710
your technique
okay every time he does a strike

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
okay every time he does a strike
 

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,030
okay every time he does a strike
you then do your technique

16
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040

 

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,430

so you're always after the fact you

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
so you're always after the fact you
 

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,630
so you're always after the fact you
understand that

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
understand that
 

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,830
understand that
he does a then you do b

22
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
he does a then you do b
 

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,790
he does a then you do b
right okay that's called reactionary

24
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
right okay that's called reactionary
 

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,910
right okay that's called reactionary
reactionary never works you will

26
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
reactionary never works you will
 

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,630
reactionary never works you will
if you wait your technique is not going

28
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
if you wait your technique is not going
 

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,350
if you wait your technique is not going
to work

30
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
to work
 

31
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,630
to work
no matter what art you're doing okay

32
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640

 

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,310

in aikido we don't do the

34
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
in aikido we don't do the
 

35
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,590
in aikido we don't do the
obvious one afterwards so

36
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
obvious one afterwards so
 

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,230
obvious one afterwards so
in other words i go he goes and i go

38
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
in other words i go he goes and i go
 

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,190
in other words i go he goes and i go
here

40
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
here
 

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,950
here
and then i try and do the technique so

42
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
and then i try and do the technique so
 

43
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,469
and then i try and do the technique so
i'll show you he's going to do the

44
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
i'll show you he's going to do the
 

45
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,190
i'll show you he's going to do the
action

46
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
action
 

47
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:24,870
action
ready

48
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880

 

49
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,350

do something

50
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360

 

51
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,429

every time when he tries to counter

52
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
every time when he tries to counter
 

53
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,590
every time when he tries to counter
because he's moving after me

54
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
because he's moving after me
 

55
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,710
because he's moving after me
i'm going to be able to do something

56
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
i'm going to be able to do something
 

57
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,749
i'm going to be able to do something
else okay it looks like it worked for

58
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
else okay it looks like it worked for
 

59
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:39,990
else okay it looks like it worked for
you

60
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
you
 

61
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,310
you
in your training because what the

62
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
in your training because what the
 

63
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,350
in your training because what the
attacker did was they stopped

64
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
attacker did was they stopped
 

65
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,069
attacker did was they stopped
you see you see how i stopped i only did

66
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
you see you see how i stopped i only did
 

67
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,429
you see you see how i stopped i only did
one

68
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
one
 

69
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,710
one
but when i'm really attacking

70
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
but when i'm really attacking
 

71
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,069
but when i'm really attacking
i keep attacking got it

72
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
i keep attacking got it
 

73
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,069
i keep attacking got it
so you go okay that doesn't work so what

74
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
so you go okay that doesn't work so what
 

75
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,190
so you go okay that doesn't work so what
i'm going to do

76
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
i'm going to do
 

77
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,429
i'm going to do
is i'm going to attack first i'll be the

78
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
is i'm going to attack first i'll be the
 

79
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,510
is i'm going to attack first i'll be the
attacker every time

80
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
attacker every time
 

81
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,030
attacker every time
okay do you understand that so

82
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
okay do you understand that so
 

83
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,109
okay do you understand that so
he's he's gonna i'm just gonna attack

84
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
he's he's gonna i'm just gonna attack
 

85
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,510
he's he's gonna i'm just gonna attack
and then i'm gonna do

86
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
and then i'm gonna do
 

87
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,869
and then i'm gonna do
it see how that works and it looks like

88
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
it see how that works and it looks like
 

89
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,910
it see how that works and it looks like
it's pretty good

90
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
it's pretty good
 

91
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,150
it's pretty good
every time boom i just did

92
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,160
every time boom i just did
 

93
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,710
every time boom i just did
yeah okay

94
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
yeah okay
 

95
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,550
yeah okay
but that kind of makes you the aggressor

96
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
but that kind of makes you the aggressor
 

97
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,990
but that kind of makes you the aggressor
doesn't it

98
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
doesn't it
 

99
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,030
doesn't it
that makes you the bad guy in many ways

100
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
that makes you the bad guy in many ways
 

101
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:45,830
that makes you the bad guy in many ways
that's not what we do in aikido

102
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840

 

103
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,830

so i'm going to feel his intention

104
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840

 

105
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,790

and then at the level of intention

106
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
and then at the level of intention
 

107
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,830
and then at the level of intention
so in reaction i go ahead

108
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
so in reaction i go ahead
 

109
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,070
so in reaction i go ahead
and move at the level of physical

110
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
and move at the level of physical
 

111
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:16,869
and move at the level of physical
manifestation

112
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879

 

113
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,190

okay so all we're going to do

114
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
okay so all we're going to do
 

115
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,390
okay so all we're going to do
is stand in range and when he's thinking

116
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
is stand in range and when he's thinking
 

117
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,830
is stand in range and when he's thinking
i'm just going to put my hand in his

118
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

119
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,309

face

120
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
face
 

121
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,030
face
okay and he has to change it so he can't

122
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
okay and he has to change it so he can't
 

123
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,789
okay and he has to change it so he can't

it's a rhythm because then he's just

132
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
it's a rhythm because then he's just
 

133
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,990
it's a rhythm because then he's just
following

134
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
following
 

135
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,710

140
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
you're leaning backwards already your
 

141
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,229
you're leaning backwards already your
reaction

142
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
reaction
 

143
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,830
reaction

147
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,870

change the rhythm don't do a single

148
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880

okay so again i in english you can

160
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
okay so again i in english you can
 

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,230
okay so again i in english you can
you can call this a stockhead that's the

162
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
you can call this a stockhead that's the
 

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,510
you can call this a stockhead that's the
strategy i'm using okay so when

164
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
strategy i'm using okay so when
 

165
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,510
strategy i'm using okay so when
as he's about to strike you gotta slow

i'm hitting him i'm stopping his hit
got it it's called the stop hit all

174
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
got it it's called the stop hit all
 

175

right

176
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
right
 

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,070
right
and you could do it with anything

178
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

 

179
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,230

okay it does it's just about

180
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
okay it does it's just about
 

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,430
okay it does it's just about
interrupting

182
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
interrupting
 

183
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,430
interrupting
his intention so that i interrupt his

184
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
his intention so that i interrupt his
 

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,029
his intention so that i interrupt his
right socket got it yes

186
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
right socket got it yes
 

187
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,550
right socket got it yes
okay so when i do a stop hit i'm trying

188
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
okay so when i do a stop hit i'm trying
 

189
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,189
okay so when i do a stop hit i'm trying
to operate at the level of intention

190
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
to operate at the level of intention
 

191
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,710
to operate at the level of intention
i am trying not to be reactionary

192
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
i am trying not to be reactionary
 

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,629
i am trying not to be reactionary
okay so i don't lean back

194
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
okay so i don't lean back
 

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,909
okay so i don't lean back
and do it at the same time

196
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
and do it at the same time
 

197
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,070
and do it at the same time
obviously i don't let it get to the

198
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
obviously i don't let it get to the
 

199
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,909
obviously i don't let it get to the
level of manifestation

200
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
level of manifestation
 

201
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,749
level of manifestation
and then do it that's not going to work

202
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
and then do it that's not going to work
 

203
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,629
and then do it that's not going to work
so how much more difficult did i make it

204
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
so how much more difficult did i make it

juan you're not relaxed enough

232
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
juan you're not relaxed enough
 

233
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,469
juan you're not relaxed enough
if you're not relaxed enough you cannot

234
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
if you're not relaxed enough you cannot
 

235
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,749
if you're not relaxed enough you cannot
sense your own intuition

236
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
sense your own intuition
 

237
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,230
sense your own intuition
okay because you are in your tension

238
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
okay because you are in your tension
 

239
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,350
okay because you are in your tension
not actually here you are

240
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
not actually here you are
 

241
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,230
not actually here you are
in the last rep or you're in the future

in the last rep or you're in the future
red

244

red
 

245
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,670
red
so you cannot respond to what's actually

246
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
so you cannot respond to what's actually
 

247
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,869
so you cannot respond to what's actually
happening

248

when i come in i got his balance going

342
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
when i come in i got his balance going
 

343
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,190
when i come in i got his balance going
okay and i can do my things

i don't know where you're gonna feel it

356
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
i don't know where you're gonna feel it
 

357
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,710
i don't know where you're gonna feel it
but when you feel it don't start

358
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:03,720
but when you feel it don't start
 

359
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,710
but when you feel it don't start
intellectualizing it got it don't go is

360
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
intellectualizing it got it don't go is
 

361
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,069
intellectualizing it got it don't go is
that it is that it is that not

362

that it is that it is that not
 

363
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,829
that it is that it is that not
it if you feel it boom you go

364
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
it if you feel it boom you go
 

365
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,590

have the intention
you throw the stride even if their hand

372
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
you throw the stride even if their hand
 

373
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,990
you throw the stride even if their hand
is in your face

374
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
is in your face
 

375
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,310
is in your face
you got it okay let's go so

376
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
you got it okay let's go so
 

377
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,750
you got it okay let's go so
i always couple my angle of attack right

378
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
i always couple my angle of attack right
 

379
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,310
i always couple my angle of attack right
angle of defense and my angle of defense

380
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
angle of defense and my angle of defense
 

381
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,550
angle of defense and my angle of defense
is always made up of two things

382
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
is always made up of two things
 

383
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,750
is always made up of two things
okay an angle of deflection

384
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
okay an angle of deflection
 

385
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,389
okay an angle of deflection
got it so he comes in i'll bring the

386
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
got it so he comes in i'll bring the
 

387
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,310
got it so he comes in i'll bring the
punch to the outside

388
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
punch to the outside
 

389
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,310
punch to the outside
but my hands going to the inside

390
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320

 

391
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,430

so angle of deflection with the stop hit

392
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
so angle of deflection with the stop hit
 

393
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,389
so angle of deflection with the stop hit
so the two things are go the angle

394
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
so the two things are go the angle
 

395
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,230
so the two things are go the angle
deflection and you see the angle

396
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
deflection and you see the angle
 

397
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,990
deflection and you see the angle
deviation on my head i move it

398
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
deviation on my head i move it
 

399
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,949
deviation on my head i move it
out of the way forward into the side as

400
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
out of the way forward into the side as
 

401
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,829
out of the way forward into the side as
needed

402
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
needed
 

403
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,829
needed
if i don't need to if the angle of

404
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
if i don't need to if the angle of
 

405
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,030
if i don't need to if the angle of
deflection is enough

406
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
deflection is enough
 

407
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,710
deflection is enough
i will barely move my head

408
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720

 

409
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:26,829

so he goes boom

410
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

411
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,670

oh
 

413
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,150
oh
okay let's try so even though we're

414
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
okay let's try so even though we're
 

415
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,710
okay let's try so even though we're
working on the stocking strategy

416
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
working on the stocking strategy

here
 

581
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,230
here
see this comes on a second here

582
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240

 

583
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,670

stop hit

584
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680

don't lay on him your
your energy goes on the elbow

588
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
your energy goes on the elbow
 

589
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,550
your energy goes on the elbow
you understand not on you know i'm not

590
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
you understand not on you know i'm not

keeping him down
with that base i'm controlling his

594
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
with that base i'm controlling his
 

595
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,550

at the elbow okay if he tries to get up
my feet are usable

600
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
my feet are usable
 

601
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,990
my feet are usable
you see so you don't have your feet like

602
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
you see so you don't have your feet like
 

603
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,429

so this leg is here this leg is here
 

609
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,669
so this leg is here this leg is here
okay to base out

610
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679

 

611
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,230

strike to the face guess what's gonna
 

631
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,390
strike to the face guess what's gonna
happen here

632
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
happen here
 

633
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,830
happen here
okay you guys are going like this

634
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
okay you guys are going like this
 

635
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,669
okay you guys are going like this
i'm going to use the rokyo

636
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
i'm going to use the rokyo
 

637
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,270
i'm going to use the rokyo
to hit his face on the ground

638
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
to hit his face on the ground
 

639
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,549
to hit his face on the ground
okay

640
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559

 

641
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,150

what try and watch for that angle i'm

642
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
what try and watch for that angle i'm
 

643
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,909
what try and watch for that angle i'm
gonna do a little bit but i can't slam

644
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
gonna do a little bit but i can't slam
 

645
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,510
gonna do a little bit but i can't slam
his face to the ground

646
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
his face to the ground
 

647
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,990
his face to the ground
and uke's job is to not point his nose

648
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
and uke's job is to not point his nose
 

649
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,350
and uke's job is to not point his nose
at the ground

650
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
at the ground
 

651
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,310
at the ground
right so he doesn't get his nose broken

652
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
right so he doesn't get his nose broken
 

653
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,549
right so he doesn't get his nose broken
and he can kind of use that hand

654
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
and he can kind of use that hand
 

655
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,710
and he can kind of use that hand
and the counterweighting of his feet to

656
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
and the counterweighting of his feet to
 

657
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,310
and the counterweighting of his feet to
slow down the energy on his

658
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
slow down the energy on his
 

659
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,270
slow down the energy on his
face so between those those come that

660
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
face so between those those come that
 

661
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,470
face so between those those come that
combination of

662
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
combination of
 

663
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,230
combination of
i'm going to reduce the angle at the

664
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
i'm going to reduce the angle at the
 

665
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,630
i'm going to reduce the angle at the
last second he's going to turn his head

666
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
last second he's going to turn his head
 

667
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,310
last second he's going to turn his head
he's going to use his hand and he's

668
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
he's going to use his hand and he's
 

669
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,990
he's going to use his hand and he's
going to counterweight his head

670
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
going to counterweight his head
 

671
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,110
going to counterweight his head
we can do this technique

672
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
we can do this technique
 

673
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:22,549
we can do this technique
relatively safe

674
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559

 

675
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,270

that's what i'm doing you guys have this

676
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
that's what i'm doing you guys have this
 

677
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,150
that's what i'm doing you guys have this
weird

678
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160

 

679
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,710

okay so your angle is different than
