55
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,590
understand what this one context that we
think a lot about is and what what's

56
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:04,600

of controls going into this one
 

75
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,469
of controls going into this one
situation this makes for great

76
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479

the people are evenly matched and that's
 

87
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,630
the people are evenly matched and that's
what you see a lot in modern mixed

88
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:33,640
what you see a lot in modern mixed
 

89
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,830
what you see a lot in modern mixed
martial arts is this uh desire to make

90
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
martial arts is this uh desire to make
 

91
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,350

things equal and similar um in iido we

92
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
things equal and similar um in iido we
 

93
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,069
things equal and similar um in iido we
don't really look at that at all so

94
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:41,079
don't really look at that at all so
 

95
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,950
don't really look at that at all so
trying to understand iido from this

96
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
trying to understand iido from this
 

97
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,429
trying to understand iido from this
perspective is impossible and while

98
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:44,439
perspective is impossible and while
 

99
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,069
perspective is impossible and while
mixed martial arts gave us a lot it

100
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
mixed martial arts gave us a lot it
 

101
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,429
mixed martial arts gave us a lot it
doesn't really help us understand iido a

102
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:48,439
doesn't really help us understand iido a
 

103
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,630
doesn't really help us understand iido a
lot of times you'll see people from the

104
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
lot of times you'll see people from the
 

105
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,870
lot of times you'll see people from the
mixed martial arts world or sport

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,350
competitive World want to take iido and
put it into their context and then see

110
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
put it into their context and then see
 

111
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,870
put it into their context and then see
if iido is any good uh so for example we

112
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
if iido is any good uh so for example we
 

113
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,990
if iido is any good uh so for example we
have an MMA fight you tell an Niko guy

114
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,000
have an MMA fight you tell an Niko guy
 

115
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,270
have an MMA fight you tell an Niko guy
okay we'll go into the MMA ring and see

116
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
okay we'll go into the MMA ring and see
 

117
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,270
okay we'll go into the MMA ring and see
if uh your your stuff is valid against

118
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,280
if uh your your stuff is valid against
 

119
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,309
if uh your your stuff is valid against
this other guy who's a real good MMA uh

120
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
this other guy who's a real good MMA uh
 

121
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,430
this other guy who's a real good MMA uh
Fighter um this is not fair and not

122
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
Fighter um this is not fair and not
 

123
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,350
Fighter um this is not fair and not
reasonable um for example if I took an

124
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,360
reasonable um for example if I took an
 

125
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,229
reasonable um for example if I took an
MMA fighter and I took him to a a a

126
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,239
MMA fighter and I took him to a a a
 

127
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,750
MMA fighter and I took him to a a a
modern war situation and I had a soldier

128
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
modern war situation and I had a soldier
 

129
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,670
modern war situation and I had a soldier
who's been training for years in combat

130
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
who's been training for years in combat
 

131
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,790
who's been training for years in combat
situations I said okay you two go after

132
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800
situations I said okay you two go after
 

133
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,430
situations I said okay you two go after
each other and hear some guns um the MMA

134
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,440
each other and hear some guns um the MMA
 

135
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,910
each other and hear some guns um the MMA
fighter is almost certainly going to

136
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
fighter is almost certainly going to
 

137
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,830
fighter is almost certainly going to
lose to a seasoned War veteran um and

138
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840
lose to a seasoned War veteran um and
 

139
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,790
lose to a seasoned War veteran um and
when I say that story you you quickly

140
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
when I say that story you you quickly
 

141
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,550
when I say that story you you quickly
say oh well of course but if we took the

142
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,560
say oh well of course but if we took the
 

143
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,710
say oh well of course but if we took the
the war veteran and we put him in a ring

144
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:35,720
the war veteran and we put him in a ring
 

145
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,710
the war veteran and we put him in a ring
with an MMA fighter he's going to lose

146
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:37,720
with an MMA fighter he's going to lose
 

147
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,630
with an MMA fighter he's going to lose
and that's also correct because each

148
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
and that's also correct because each
 

149
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,030
and that's also correct because each
person in their own context is doing

150
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,040
person in their own context is doing
 

151
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,390
person in their own context is doing
very very well they're they're very

152
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,400
very very well they're they're very
 

153
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,110
very very well they're they're very
capable within their own context so if

154
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
capable within their own context so if
 

155
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,309
capable within their own context so if
you take a person outside of their

156
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,319
you take a person outside of their
 

157
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,589
you take a person outside of their
context and put them in someone else's

158
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
context and put them in someone else's
 

159
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,190
context and put them in someone else's
context they're not going to do very

160
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
context they're not going to do very
 

161
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,470
context they're not going to do very
good but within their own context

162
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,480
good but within their own context
 

163
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,390
good but within their own context
they'll do very very well so if you take

164
