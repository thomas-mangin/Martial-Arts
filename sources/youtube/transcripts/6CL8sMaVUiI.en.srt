1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,489
I was interested in doing a martial art

2
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,000
and my first teacher, Terry Ezra, came to my

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
high school and he did a demonstration

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,799
and from the moment I saw it I just

5
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,930
thought "Yeah, this is great this is what

6
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,240
I want to do". I thought it was wonderful

7
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,299
Even though I was very young, the

8
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,610
movements and the philosophy and how it

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,679
was presented to me seemed very natural

10
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,509
and very logical

11
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,690
so as a kid it really appealed me.

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,600
My first teacher was a guy called Stephen Parn

13
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,880
I really should mention him because

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,869
he ran my local dojo in Chester.

15
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,400
He was 4th Kyu. Can you believe it he was 4th Kyu...

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,400
But in those days a lot of people were 4th Kyu,

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,500
if you were 3rd kyu you were senior grade, you know.

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
They were no 3rd Dan around

19
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,490
It was actually just post Chiba Sensei.

20
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,000
Chiba Sensei had left about a year or two before,

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
this was 1980.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,869
So it was very much the aftermath of

23
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,820
Chiba sensei being there.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
Kanetsuka Sensei was the technical director

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,759
he became the technical director

26
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,549
of the British Aikido Federation at that time.

27
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,670
But there was still a strong influence

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,800
from the time that Chiba Sensei was there.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,980
And these two influences started

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,200
to diverge at that time.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,800
So I was more

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,260
towards the Kanetsuka Seinsei side :

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,200
he became the technical director,

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,300
so he was the technical director that I knew.

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,000
I did not know Chiba Sensei from the 1980's.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,080
Saying that in 1982 or 83,

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Chiba Seinsei came back to the UK

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
and he taught to summer school in Lancaster,

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
and that was the first time I'd seen him.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
And I went to San Diego after that.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,769
When I was 16, I went for a couple of weeks

42
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,300
to train with him then.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,500
So that was my first exposure to Chiba Sensei

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,200
So I'd only done Aikido

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
for maybe five years

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
and I suddenly went to this dojo...

47
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
I couldn't understand it at all...

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was a very strange experience for me

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
to be in that environment

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
You know I'd come from a small town in England

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
with my local dojo...

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and then suddenly going to

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,200
a dojo that was called the pressure cooker.

54
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,000
And Chiba Sensei was very intense and very...

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,400
I mean he was at the height of his power.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I was just a visitor

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,800
and it was like sightseeing, you know.

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,100
So, he was very nice to me

59
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,669
but still saying that, I was very wary of him

60
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,250
because... the sense

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,849
of power and energy around him was scary,

62
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,620
and also I could see what he was doing

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,760
with his students and and his daughter.

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,800
At that time she was very young

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,000
she was training...

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,239
I was protected, really,

67
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,430
because I was just a visitor.

68
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,590
Yes I was living in England then.

69
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,000
A couple years later I moved down to London

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,060
to train with Kanetsuka Sensei.

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,200
I stayed there for about a year.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
And then I moved to Japan

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,700
I went to japan when I was 20

74
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,700
Yes, Ken was one of my first teachers actually.

75
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
He lived near Chester

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
he was not far from Chester

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and he used to come down.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,200
Every friday evening we used to have a class

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
which would rotate the teachers

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
and Ken was one of those teachers.

81
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
So he would come down

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
Of course, we were very excited...

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,100
We were kids, you know,

84
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
and we were very excited that this man had tea

85
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,900
with O Sensei...

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
and he used to tell us stories and that was great.

87
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,500
He was a lovely guy.

88
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
Actually, before I came to Japan I went to his house

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,700
and he gave me lots of advice about living in Japan.

90
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,000
I'd wanted to go to Japan since I was about 16

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because I'd heard about Hombu Dojo.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
We didn't know a lot about Hombu Dojo in England then,

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,700
we weren't told very much about it.

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,259
But I had this goal

95
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,000
that I really wanted to go there

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and train at Hombu Dojo.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,419
A young japanese man came to England - Tanaka San

98
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,400
He was from Humbo Dojo

99
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,459
He said "Yes you should go

100
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,159
definitely it's a great experience".

101
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,100
In England we knew Shibata Sensei

102
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,609
who had been over,

103
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,369
we'd also seen Yamaguchi Sensei,

104
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:47,000
at that time I think Yokota Sensei

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,389
had also been to England...

106
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,889
So we've had some influences and some contact

107
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,000
with Humbu Dojo Shihan at that time.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
So I went.

109
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,910
Yes. I mean, I went for Aikido.

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,200
I was planning to teach English,

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,800
that was going to be what I was going to do to survive.

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,900
But it wasn't so easy in the beginning :

113
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,690
it took me awhile to get a job.

114
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,000
But eventually I got a job,

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,760
so I tried to revolve my job around my training.

116
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
It depended when I was working :

117
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,300
I would train the morning

118
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
if I was working in the afternoon,

119
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,550
if I was working in the morning

120
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,700
I trained in the afternoon...

121
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,250
So I would just fit it in around my work

122
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,000
But, I mean, most mornings I would try to go

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
to Waka Sensei 's class

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
6:30 am class at the dojo

125
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,000
and then maybe an evening or an afternoon class also...

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,500
As much as I could...

127
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,171
Not at all. I tried to go to everybody.

128
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
I didn't discriminate at all.

129
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,100
The only teachers I couldn't go with

130
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,600
it was when I was working.

131
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,600
And I feel very sad now

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
that I never went to Arikawa's

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
- I think I went to one of Arikawa Sensei -

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,219
because I was working.

135
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:20,500
Sometimes it was just hard to get to them all,

136
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,700
but I tried to go as much as possible

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,800
to see as many as possible

138
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,500
I used to train a lot with Kuribayashi Sensei,

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Kanazawa Sensei, Etsuji Horii Sensei,

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Sugawara Sensei and Kobayashi Sensei.

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,360
They were not Ushi Deshi at that time,

142
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
they already started to teach,

143
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,100
so they weren't in Hombu Dojo.

144
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
They would come to Osawa Sensei's class

145
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,230
on the thursday morning.

146
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,000
Yoko Okamoto Sensei was there

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
and I would try to train with Yoko.

148
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,040
That was the period that she was raising her family,

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,980
she had her babies then...

150
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,500
And there was two foreign Uchi Deshi at that time

151
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,600
in Hombu Dojo :

152
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,500
Yahe Solomon and Rosso Fernandez

153
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,000
from New Zealand.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
They were living there for a few years

155
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,900
Yes, I found it very very strange.

156
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,500
And I had a very difficult time outside the dojo.

157
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
There weren't many foreigners around

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
generally in Japan at that time.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We were very exotic, the people were very curious

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I was scrutinized a lot

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think as a young foreign woman to, you know

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,690
So sometimes it was very hard,

163
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,810
it was kind of tiring, it was very tiring

164
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,000
to have that constantly.

165
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,070
I'm sure it did, definitely.

166
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,200
I mean, for or me that was my experience.

167
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
I can't say about the other women who were there

168
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,500
- they were quite a lot of american women there -

169
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,900
I don't know if they had the same experiences

170
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
but I know from my point of view

171
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,000
I had some in kind of difficult times.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,070
And it was also very lonely

173
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,340
I mean, you had this sort of solitary existence where

174
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,500
you're going to the dojo

175
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,610
you're going to work

176
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,700
and, you know, you're tired a lot of the time

177
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,000
and you know you are being looked at...

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's very lonely, that kind of life

179
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,000
I was there three and a half years

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,110
and at the end I was ready to go

181
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,500
I wanted to leave.

182
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,100
I think for most people then they didn't consider

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,000
that it was a place they would live

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,690
it was a transient place you'd stay for 2-3 years

185
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,000
and then you would go

186
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,800
I never had any plan to do that.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,100
I think that sounds really good

188
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,800
and I should have had that plan,

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
but I didn't,

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,500
which was a mistake.

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,700
So now, it wasn't part of a great plan I had but

192
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,500
that just seemed to be the finite time that I stayed there.

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,610
I never thought about the future

194
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,200
I never even thought about being in Japan

195
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,900
as being good for my resume,

196
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,900
or good in the sense that when or if

197
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,840
I become an Aikido teacher this would

198
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,800
look good that I was in Japan...

199
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
I never even considered that,

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
I just wanted to train it was all about.

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,800
It was very day to day.

202
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
And even going to San Diego

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,670
- I went to San Diego straightaway after japan -

204
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,820
it was only it with the thought that

205
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't want my daily Aikido to stop,

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,570
and I knew if I went back to the UK

207
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,460
it would stop.

208
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,900
So that's why I went to San Diego :

209
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,600
merely just to continue my daily Aikido life.

210
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,360
I had a good friend in Japan, Yahe Solomon,

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,900
and he recommended that I go to Chiba Sensei.

212
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,330
I'd already had some contact with

213
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,350
Chiba Sensei,

214
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,000
so, that was what I did. I went back there.

215
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,000
I didn't, I didn't take part.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
I didn't want to do it

217
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,500
because I think my Aikido

218
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
was quite formed at that stage :

219
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,889
I was already 3rd Dan,

220
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,139
I've been training for quite a long time

221
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,600
since I was very young,

222
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,000
and I felt it wasn't really what I wanted to do.

223
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,600
Then I went back to the UK.

224
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
My father got very sick and he died,

225
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
so I went back to the UK

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and I stayed there for three years.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Then I try to do some other stuff not just Aikido.

228
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,800
I had a very small group there in the UK.

229
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,400
That was in Chester.

230
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,200
But that was interesting,

231
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,660
It was an interesting experience to suddenly

232
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,500
have gone from those very intensive years of training

233
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
to suddenly not intense,

234
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,400
and having people that I had to teach...

235
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,850
And I was really stuck

236
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,399
I became really stuck in translating

237
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,000
what I've been doing into teaching.

238
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,510
When you actually stop

239
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,200
your daily training and try to open a dojo,

240
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,700
the reality is quite depressing.

241
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,260
It can be quite disappointing and

242
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,800
depressing, you know.

243
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
From the start you get students

244
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,100
who are just not as enthusiastic as you.

245
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,400
That's the first reality check you get.

246
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
So, if you believe that you're going to get students

247
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,000
come through the door who just think

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,410
you're great because you did Aikido

249
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,100
for 3-4 hours a day...

250
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,200
And I know a lot of teachers find this,

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
they get sick of teaching beginners

252
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,200
they just want to teach Yudansha,

253
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
or they just want to teach Ko Kyu Nage or...

254
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
But of course the majority of your teaching is

255
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
teaching somebody how to fall,

256
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,800
how to stand up, how to turn...

257
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,500
That's 90% of the job :

258
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,800
where you put your foot, where you put your hand...

259
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,700
That's it.

260
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,400
And unless you love that

261
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
then you're not going to enjoy teaching.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,770
And also, you know,

263
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,900
I think it's a good experience

264
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,870
to have your own dojo and to be creating

265
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,970
your own students :

266
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,500
it makes you a different Aikidoka, I think.

267
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,000
I think the primary thing

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,160
that I personally got from Chiba Sensei

269
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,500
was how to run a dojo,

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,400
how to relate to people.

271
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,400
That was a huge part of his teaching as well :

272
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,700
he was good at giving you an idea

273
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,000
of what your responsibilities were

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,500
as an Aikidoka.

275
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
I think, depending what I'm doing,

276
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,700
I take different aspects

277
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,100
of the various teachers that I trained with.

278
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,180
Teaching beginners,

279
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,269
very often, I look to who I trained with

280
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,689
as a beginner, how I learned and

281
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,000
what spoke to me as a beginner.

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
So therefore my first Aikido teachers

283
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
were my biggest influences.

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If I'm training with people who are a little bit more advanced

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,200
then I take something from

286
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,500
a teacher I trained with

287
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,600
when I was more advanced.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
If I'm trying to give some

289
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,000
maybe a slightly deeper feeling of Aikido or...

290
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,800
then I would relate to another teacher

291
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,000
that I used to train with, you know...

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So it very much depends on what I'm doing.

293
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,000
For me, of course, my situation's slightly different ;

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm married to somebody who has a job.

295
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I mean, this makes everything quite different.

296
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:10,800
But probably if you ask somebody who

297
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,700
is supporting a family through doing Aikido

298
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,500
then I think that it is a very precarious life...

299
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,400
It's not so good to be like that.

300
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,700
So I don't even know if it's possible

301
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,220
that somebody can actually

302
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,700
be purely professional in that sense, you know.

303
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,400
I think you have to be very flexible,

304
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,069
you have to be very open,

305
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:37,900
you have to drop a lot of your expectations...

306
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,500
Maybe you have to be more inclusive in what you do...

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,500
It's very hard to take a hard line as a teacher

308
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,350
Well, you could look at it

309
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,200
as dropping your standards, but...

310
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,970
I think you don't necessarily have to drop

311
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,800
your technical standards, but maybe

312
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,100
you just have to accept

313
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
that you're going to get people to come to your dojo

314
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
who are not going to be able to move

315
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,490
in the way you want :

316
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,600
they're going to be old,

317
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
they're going to be overweight,

318
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
they're going to be predominantly older actually

319
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,680
because not many young people come to Aikido...

320
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,200
So, in that way, you have to

321
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
adapt your standards to what's in front of you,

322
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
rather than drop your standards.

323
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,700
I think possibly... It's maybe a combination

324
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
of a few things :

325
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
As teachers get older, they tend to

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,160
not attract younger people, I think this is a factor.

327
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,600
And also I think it's people

328
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,400
remaining in power

329
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,100
when they should be disseminating power, really,

330
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,500
and delegating power to others,

331
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
and getting younger people to teach,

332
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,800
getting younger people to teach in the dojo.

333
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,700
I mean, we see that in Greece :

334
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,230
younger people teaching in the dojo

335
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,600
you bring younger people in.

336
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,060
I mean they don't want to necessarily have

337
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,000
a 50 years old woman like me teaching them.

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,500
That's a fact, so...

339
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,600
I think it's a bit troubling,

340
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,400
but I think if people try to hold on

341
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,900
to this sort of fantasy

342
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,700
that they are going to be the Sensei

343
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
or the teacher for ever,

344
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,600
I think this is quite damaging

345
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,700
to Aikido, and they fear letting go of something.

346
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,300
There needs to be some flexibility around

347
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,300
teaching or

348
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,700
getting young people more involved

349
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,100
in the teaching process.

350
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,700
And also empowering them to feel

351
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,200
that they have a future in Aikido.

352
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,100
I think it's very stacked against them,

353
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,220
you know : they come and it's the same people

354
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,500
again and again...

355
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,000
I think it's very calcifying for Aikido.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,609
But, of course, it's kind of mixed

357
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:12,600
with a traditional element of Japan

358
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
which has a strong hierarchy.

359
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,049
But it doesn't lend itself

360
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,800
to much dynamism, I think.

361
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,200
I think that is important.

362
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,300
And people... white belts who are impacted by Aikido :

363
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,800
how is Aikido impacting their lives ?

364
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
As kyu grade, as a white belt ?

365
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,400
Because they're important !

366
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,500
We always concentrate on the Yudansha

367
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
or the teachers,

368
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,900
but without those people we were not here !

369
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,400
That's the fact.

370
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,500
And so, if we continually ignore them

371
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,400
then, in 20 years there's not gonna be anybody left

372
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
to teach.

373
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
You know, we might not be - well, you'll be around, you're young -

374
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
but I might no longer be around in 20 years,

375
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,100
and if you're continually sidelining

376
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,419
the beginners or white belts or...

377
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,900
I think it's a grave mistake, really,

378
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
and we'll pay the price,

379
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,900
we will really pay the price, you know.

380
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,100
A lot of classes, I think,

381
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,500
could be more geared towards lower grades.

382
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,430
Posture, Tai Sabaki... simple stuff that

383
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,200
we tend to lose sight of, you know.

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,100
We're flinging people around and we're looking great...

385
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,300
But you lose sight of

386
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
what's really fundamental

387
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,200
and what makes people think they're learning something.

388
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,000
I feel that from in my own dojo,

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
that people have to feel that they are

390
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,400
starting from somewhere and they are

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,230
progressing and getting better

392
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,570
and they have a base, they have a strong base.

393
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,200
I think that's important.

394
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,800
So maybe that's something that could be looked at,

395
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,930
that there's a fundamental class

396
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,750
there's a basics class for people.

397
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,700
Because, I think if you miss that part of the training

398
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,300
and the development,

399
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
then you never get that back,

400
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,140
you just learn techniques and they're just arbitrary

401
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,300
techniques that you're learning

402
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,000
but you have no base or foundation.

403
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, I think more men do Aikido than women,

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,369
I mean generally. That's a fact.

405
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,739
And I'm not exactly sure why either,

406
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:40,900
maybe men are a little bit more ambitious

407
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,500
than women to teach...

408
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,090
They have a stronger will to power than women,

409
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,400
I think women don't naturally take

410
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,900
an authoritative position,

411
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,100
it's not in their nature...

412
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm not saying it's not in all-women's nature's but mostly,

413
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,900
I make a generalization, you know...

414
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,000
But I'm not really sure why.

415
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
I guess it's just a proportion thing

416
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
that there are more men around

417
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
than women.

418
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,200
And I think there's a strong lack of

419
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,100
maybe self-confidence with women :

420
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,200
they are not as powerful,

421
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,729
they're not as physically strong as men, you know...

422
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:21,500
Of course you get small men and big women...

423
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,400
but generally,

424
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,700
women are not as physically powerful.

425
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,500
And I think that maybe makes them less confident,

426
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,700
that they don't feel that they can be teachers

427
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,200
or have any authority, you know.

428
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Saying that, when I was in America,

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
there were many senior women

430
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,200
who were very good teachers

431
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,400
and very confident and very able to teach.

432
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
So I think it depends on the country

433
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,500
I think there's a big cultural element, yes.

434
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,100
In America the women are maybe...

435
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,780
they're more equal and they're more accepting

436
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,000
and their expectations of themselves are different,

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,100
they are very different.

438
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,900
But in America, definitely, there is

439
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,100
much more gender equality, I think.

440
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,200
And I think probably Yamada Sensei

441
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,500
and also Chiba Sensei when he was alive he did a lot

442
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,100
to promote women,

443
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
and they're very open to women teaching.

444
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,500
There are so many different sides to that...

445
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,600
What's going on the mat with men and women ?

446
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,500
I just think it's not a simple as

447
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,100
women not being encouraged or

448
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,800
men being encouraged or...

449
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,900
I think there's just a lot going on, you know.

450
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,200
This is not simple to answer this about...

451
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Obviously there are issues that you see...

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,500
But, I personally have not been greatly affected by them any,

453
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
it's quite lucky.

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,900
But maybe I have been but haven't known about it.

455
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,300
I do think women have to be twice as good as men

456
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,900
to be rated the same. They really do.

457
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,830
I think you have to be exceptional as a woman...

458
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,600
You know, I've seen a lot of guys who are quite mediocre

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,300
and they get teaching positions

460
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,600
because they're strong,

461
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
they can throw people.

462
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,900
So that becomes the bottom line, you know.

463
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,500
But it's the wrong bottom line

464
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,700
I think probably that's the most common

465
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,490
complaint I've heard from women,

466
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,900
it's that they're constantly corrected by men.

467
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,190
Whatever the ability of the man is

468
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,899
they're just constantly corrected.

469
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,600
It's an assumption that the woman is not as good

470
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,200
as good as the man.

471
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,000
And I think that one is very strange :

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
what kind of man does that ?

473
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,000
I think it's very strange...

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, I will say that

475
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,710
the gender issue was missing tonight [during the seminar] (laugher)

476
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,300
because that is a complaint I've heard

477
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,400
many times from women.

478
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I mean, this is everywhere for women,

479
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,529
this kind of thing,

480
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,159
this aggression or, you know, undercutting,

481
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
and things like telling women what to do...

482
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
I mean that's just everywhere.

483
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,580
But I think that's how it manifests on the mat

484
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,200
and it's physical and it's not very pleasant,

485
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
it can be very upsetting, very very upsetting.

486
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,200
I don't know how that could change.

487
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,000
I really don't know

488
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,800
how that issue can be brought forward and be opened.

489
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,900
I mean, for me, as a female teacher,

490
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,100
what is red rag to my bull

491
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,200
is a man who does not take Ukemi for a woman.

492
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,400
And the man can be

493
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
much worse technically

494
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,700
than the woman

495
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
but he will just not take Ukemi for her.

496
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
And I've seen that on a number of occasions,

497
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,100
and I have to say that's one thing

498
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,300
that can get me really angry.

499
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,000
I can get very angry when I see that.

500
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,500
I think that's the sign of a healthy dojo

501
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,000
when there's a good percentage of the dojo with women.

502
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
If it's just all men...

503
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
When I'm recommending somebody to go to a dojo

504
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,700
I always say :

505
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,800
"Make sure there's a lot of women in the dojo".

506
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
Because if it is not,

507
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,600
then something not going right in that dojo.

508
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,500
It's usually a sign that something isn't going right,

509
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
definitely.

510
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,600
One thing I always do which, I think, helps

511
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,800
diminish this, definitely in my dojo

512
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,200
- and I think in a lot of dojos - is

513
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,100
I always focus on Ukemi.

514
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,200
When I get beginners coming in - men -

515
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
I always focus on the Ukemi

516
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,000
rather than the technique.

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
So they have an understanding

518
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,500
that they are falling and receiving a movement :

519
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,800
whatever that movement is,

520
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,039
how good or bad,

521
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,100
their job is to fall.

522
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,500
And I think when you emphasize that

523
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,200
it really changes the dynamic.

524
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,700
And I get them to fall by themselves,

525
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,580
I don't make them fall, you know.

526
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,500
That solo practice of Ukemi,

527
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,100
I think it helps them understand, you know :

528
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,909
you're not waiting necessarily to be thrown,

529
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:45,400
that is a practicing of itself.

530
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,000
Not intentionally, no.

531
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,900
Whether people perceive something else ?

532
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't know. Maybe they do, maybe they don't...

533
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,900
It's very difficult to judge what you transmit

534
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,000
when you are teaching...

535
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,900
I mean, I don't talk about anything esoteric

536
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,600
or anything like that...

537
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,100
Sometimes I talk about "internal expansion",

538
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,600
"moving from the centre"...

539
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,000
But I don't talk about any "spirituality"

540
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,500
or, you know, any "meditative stage"

541
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,000
Well, you know, as a teacher you always like to see

542
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
somebody behaving well

543
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,100
and doing not only good Aikido

544
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,000
but doing Aikido in a good responsible way

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
and in a caring way

546
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
- looking after the Uke -

547
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,800
making sure that they're doing not only clear technique

548
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,100
but they're showing good character.

549
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,400
I mean, I think that's very important,

550
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,400
and quite often you don't always see those two together...

551
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Somebody can be very very good at Aikido

552
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,500
but not necessarily display good character

553
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,900
Quite often it manifest physically.

554
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,500
If mentally they're not there

555
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,400
it will manifest.

556
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:30,000
So, it is quite hard, actually, to just separate those two

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,070
...

558
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,000
No, I don't think it does...

559
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,500
It can...

560
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,600
but it doesn't just by doing it.

561
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,000
I think if you practice well and with sincerity

562
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,400
and really care about your partner,

563
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
then it makes you a better person.

564
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
But just the act of doing Aikido,

565
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
arbitrarily no, it doesn't just make you a better person.

566
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,200
I think that's the dream, but it doesn't.

567
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,800
I knew my husband from when I was 16.

568
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,700
He used to come over from Dublin

569
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,900
with the Irish Aikido group

570
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,200
to the BAF summer schools and I knew him from there.

571
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,000
And I met him again in 1995 in America,

572
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,300
because I'd gone back to America

573
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,400
for a couple of weeks and he was

574
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,100
going to stay there for six months.

575
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,419
So I met him and he invited me to come Greece

576
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,301
to teach a seminar.

577
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,900
So that's how it happened : I came

578
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,800
and then I moved to Greece to be with him.

579
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,300
He already had a dojo in Greece, and a group

580
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,500
And then I came over and we ran it together.

581
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:03,400
It's gone, I would say, from being a very small activity

582
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,900
to suddenly mushrooming in the last six-seven years

583
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,800
So now there are tens and tens of dojos around...

584
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,700
We try as best as we can to collaborate on to

585
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,800
this potential IAF recognition, if you call it that

586
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,200
we are we're all working together to achieve this

587
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
which is great we're all on board with that.

588
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,500
There's a lot of different seminars

589
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,700
that happen in Greece

590
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,900
so, you know, we try to support

591
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
as many seminars as we can.

592
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,700
We have Sugawara Sensei or Kobayashi Sensei

593
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,800
come over from Hombu Dojo

594
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,100
so this is a joined seminar

595
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,500
with all of the Hombu recognize groups within Greece,

596
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,000
we all are inviting those teachers...

597
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,800
I feel exactly the same.

598
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,000
I will always be a student of Hombu Dojo.

599
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,149
For me that hasn't changed at all...

600
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,779
It makes no difference

601
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,940
Like I'd always think :

602
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,300
"could I take good Ukemi for Sugawara Sensei"

603
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,400
"could I take good Ukemi for Kobayashi Sensei"...

604
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,800
That would always be my primary thought.
