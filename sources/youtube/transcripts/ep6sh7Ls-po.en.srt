because once she feels an adhesion she's
 

147
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,749
because once she feels an adhesion she's
going to try to get out of it like

then what else you noticed is your
 

321
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,909
then what else you noticed is your
joints got all locked look how weird

322
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
joints got all locked look how weird
 

323
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,790
joints got all locked look how weird
you're look at your weird body right now

324
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
you're look at your weird body right now
 

325
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,630
you're look at your weird body right now
okay so stay there if you can I'll find

326
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
okay so stay there if you can I'll find
 

327
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,430
okay so stay there if you can I'll find
you again but you're like this you see

328
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
you again but you're like this you see
 

329
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,990
you again but you're like this you see
whereas in the beginning look how

330
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,000
whereas in the beginning look how
 

331
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,230
whereas in the beginning look how
comfortable you are you're you know you

332
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
comfortable you are you're you know you

can move all your joints but boom and
 

335
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,710
can move all your joints but boom and
we're here again the joints get locked

336
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
we're here again the joints get locked
 

337
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,870
we're here again the joints get locked
okay and then pay attention to your

338
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
okay and then pay attention to your
 

339
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,710
okay and then pay attention to your
posture you're in a lean as opposed to

340
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:57,720
posture you're in a lean as opposed to
 

341
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,670
posture you're in a lean as opposed to
here okay so as as soon as I touch where

342
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
here okay so as as soon as I touch where
 

343
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,750
here okay so as as soon as I touch where
however I touch so however I touch I

344
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:04,760
however I touch so however I touch I
 

345
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,030
however I touch so however I touch I
want those joints locked and I want your

346
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,040
want those joints locked and I want your
 

347
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,870
want those joints locked and I want your
posture compromised okay and um you'll

348
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:13,880
posture compromised okay and um you'll
 

349
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,230
posture compromised okay and um you'll
do whatever cuz if you don't then I'm

350
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
do whatever cuz if you don't then I'm
 

351
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,829
do whatever cuz if you don't then I'm
going to get you do you

352
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
going to get you do you
 

353
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,630
going to get you do you
see so she'll do whatever she got out of

354
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,640
see so she'll do whatever she got out of
 

355
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,069
see so she'll do whatever she got out of
it but I just rolled that in so let's go

356
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:24,079
it but I just rolled that in so let's go
 

357
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,470
it but I just rolled that in so let's go
over here okay so she's trying to do

358
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
over here okay so she's trying to do
 

359
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,190
over here okay so she's trying to do
this

360
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
this
 

361
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,870
this
counter go around it like you did do you

362
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
counter go around it like you did do you
 

363
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,630
counter go around it like you did do you
see okay only we're in this

364
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,640
see okay only we're in this
 

365
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,910
see okay only we're in this
tilt so when she goes around it and then

366
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:36,920
tilt so when she goes around it and then
 

367
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,230
tilt so when she goes around it and then
I take it more into the Tilt do you see

368
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
I take it more into the Tilt do you see
 

369
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,110
I take it more into the Tilt do you see
and then the joints are more

370
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,120
and then the joints are more
 

371
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,710
and then the joints are more
locked and that's that follow part okay

372
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
locked and that's that follow part okay
 

373
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,710
locked and that's that follow part okay
so here's the joints and the posture you

374
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
so here's the joints and the posture you
 

375
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,710
so here's the joints and the posture you
try to get out of it and I followed it

376
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,720
try to get out of it and I followed it
 

377
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,110
try to get out of it and I followed it
to the next adhesion point so I'm going

378
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,120
to the next adhesion point so I'm going
 

379
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,710
to the next adhesion point so I'm going
to let go of this side even though it

380
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
to let go of this side even though it
 

381
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,750
to let go of this side even though it
helps with the adhesion and this is what

382
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
helps with the adhesion and this is what
 

383
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,870
helps with the adhesion and this is what
I mean you see how it

384
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
I mean you see how it
 

385
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,630
I mean you see how it
it has a pulling energy to it okay has a

386
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:03,640
it has a pulling energy to it okay has a
 

387
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,630
it has a pulling energy to it okay has a
pulling energy right clearly but if you

388
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:07,640
pulling energy right clearly but if you
 

389
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,870
pulling energy right clearly but if you
went over here go ahead and get out of

390
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:09,880
went over here go ahead and get out of
 

391
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,030
went over here go ahead and get out of
it get out of it and push on my hand NOP

392
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,040
it get out of it and push on my hand NOP
 

393
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,430
it get out of it and push on my hand NOP
push on my hand this way and you see

394
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:16,440
push on my hand this way and you see
 

395
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,630
push on my hand this way and you see
that it had that wall effect too you

396
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,640
that it had that wall effect too you
 

397
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,150
that it had that wall effect too you
see okay so I reach for you and I get

398
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,160
see okay so I reach for you and I get
 

399
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,110
see okay so I reach for you and I get
you in that

400
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
you in that
 

401
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,110
you in that
same thing you see it's right there even

402
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
same thing you see it's right there even
 

403
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,829
same thing you see it's right there even
your breathing has stopped

404
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
your breathing has stopped
 

405
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,269
your breathing has stopped
okay so then you would get around it

406
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:32,279
okay so then you would get around it
 

407
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,230
okay so then you would get around it
however and I take it into the next one

408
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,240

 

409
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,670

again so it looks like khole in a way if

410
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:40,680
again so it looks like khole in a way if
 

411
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,230
again so it looks like khole in a way if
you grab you grab it looks like khole in

412
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
you grab you grab it looks like khole in
 

413
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,710
you grab you grab it looks like khole in
that as soon as you touch you can do it

414
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
that as soon as you touch you can do it
 

415
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,670
that as soon as you touch you can do it
but you can't tell in the camera that

416
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
but you can't tell in the camera that
 

417
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,670
but you can't tell in the camera that
she was trying to get around in all

418
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:50,680
she was trying to get around in all
 

419
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,430
she was trying to get around in all
these different ways okay so what I like

420
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
these different ways okay so what I like
 

421
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,750
these different ways okay so what I like
to do is give you chances to get out you

422
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,760
to do is give you chances to get out you
 

423
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,629
to do is give you chances to get out you
see so I'll like hold you here and let

424
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:58,639
see so I'll like hold you here and let
 

425

the other thing I'll do is

428
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
the other thing I'll do is
 

429
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,670
the other thing I'll do is
uh start it like and I'll pull I I like

430
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,680
uh start it like and I'll pull I I like
 

431
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,190
uh start it like and I'll pull I I like
to feel CU I'm trying to cultivate those

432
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
to feel CU I'm trying to cultivate those
 

433
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,150
to feel CU I'm trying to cultivate those
skills right there's no need to to pull

434
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,160
skills right there's no need to to pull
 

435
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,230
skills right there's no need to to pull
you but you could feel that great

436
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,240
you but you could feel that great
 

437
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,509
you but you could feel that great
friction on your hand right and so that

438
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519
friction on your hand right and so that
 

439
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,150
friction on your hand right and so that
is the IC feel like I'm going to emit

440
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
is the IC feel like I'm going to emit
 

441
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,790
is the IC feel like I'm going to emit
the Y

442
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:33,800
the Y
 

443
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,590
the Y
value equal to the hand

444
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
value equal to the hand
 

445
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,910
value equal to the hand
contact like there's no point in

446
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:38,920
contact like there's no point in
 

447
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,829
contact like there's no point in
martially to do that but in terms of

448
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
martially to do that but in terms of
 

449
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,949
martially to do that but in terms of
cultivating the skill I am cultivating

450
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:43,959
cultivating the skill I am cultivating
 

451
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,150
cultivating the skill I am cultivating
it you see so sometimes I do that uh

452
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,160
it you see so sometimes I do that uh
 

453
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,150
it you see so sometimes I do that uh
sometimes I know I have you here but I

454
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,160
sometimes I know I have you here but I
 

455
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,710
sometimes I know I have you here but I
pull you back into into the technique

456
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
pull you back into into the technique
 

457
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,629
pull you back into into the technique
again to give you another

458
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639

 

459
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,710

chance this is this one's all go back

460
00:11:59,710 --> 00:11:59,720
chance this is this one's all go back
 

461
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,110
chance this is this one's all go back
here she goes around it that's all

462
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,120
here she goes around it that's all
 

463
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,670
here she goes around it that's all
following there but as we as she follow

464
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
following there but as we as she follow
 

465
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,629
following there but as we as she follow
as I follow I take it right into the

466
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
as I follow I take it right into the
 

467
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:16,509
as I follow I take it right into the
connection again you see it's right

468
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:16,519

 

469
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,910

here then the next thing I do is um I

470
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
here then the next thing I do is um I
 

471
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,110
here then the next thing I do is um I
have to resist the

472
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
have to resist the
 

473
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,790
have to resist the
temptation to contrast you to contest

474
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:29,800
temptation to contrast you to contest
 

475
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,430
temptation to contrast you to contest
you okay so and that's what allows me to

476
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:32,440
you okay so and that's what allows me to
 

477
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,350
you okay so and that's what allows me to
get in Crazy situations and have fun

478
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
get in Crazy situations and have fun
 

479
