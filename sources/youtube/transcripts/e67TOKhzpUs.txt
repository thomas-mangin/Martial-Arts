so mike's grabbing my shoulder in this
before he has a chance to hit me i'm
going to attack his face here so i was
just trying to knock him off of me
but he blocks and he's right with me as
i remove my hand mike stays right with
me so if i pulled it to my center mike
would be right on top of me so what i do
is make a solo warrior movement
as i pull my hand free mike sticks
straight to my hand and i use this
chance i use this opportunity to take
advantage of the balance i can take from
him i'm going to step through here
grabbing his hand and turn as i come
through here i'll apply this
and push it down
one more time
