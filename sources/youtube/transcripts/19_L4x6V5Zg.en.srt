going flat on this circle I don't want
 

199
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,390
going flat on this circle I don't want
to do that because I'm going to activate

in and my my arm is continually to try

206
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,280
in and my my arm is continually to try
 

207
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,510

to turn that

208
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
to turn that
 

209
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,670
to turn that
way go back a little bit it's not that I

210
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
way go back a little bit it's not that I
 

211
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,710
way go back a little bit it's not that I
started and then I try to bring this out

with my outer Delta I'm trying not
 

215
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:27,430
with my outer Delta I'm trying not
to okay so it starts to turn and I keep

00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
it was always doing so to go up and
 

267
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,029
it was always doing so to go up and
in I'm going to come come up Palm

up Palm
up and then there's your iners

272
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199

 

273
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,469

spiral so you watch my two hands this

274
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:13,479
spiral so you watch my two hands this
 

275
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,510
spiral so you watch my two hands this
one was going this

276
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
one was going this
 

277
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,390
one was going this
way this one's going that way they move

278
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,400
way this one's going that way they move
 

279
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,830
way this one's going that way they move
his whole body

280
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

281
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,270

together so it goes

282
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
together so it goes
 

283
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,629
together so it goes
up and I want to focus

284
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
up and I want to focus
 

285
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,070
up and I want to focus
well let me just have you try that first

286
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080
well let me just have you try that first
 

287
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,190
well let me just have you try that first
the two arms move together so think

288
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,200
the two arms move together so think
 

289
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:58,190
the two arms move together so think
about this still doing what it was

290
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200

 

291
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,550

doing

292
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560

 

293
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,069

all right two hands moving together

294
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:06,079
all right two hands moving together
 

295
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:06,870
all right two hands moving together
let's

296
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
let's
 

297
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,630
let's
try now your ego trip typ mind is going

298
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
try now your ego trip typ mind is going
 

299
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,230
try now your ego trip typ mind is going
to go oh arm arm break here you get it

300
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
to go oh arm arm break here you get it
 

301
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,310
to go oh arm arm break here you get it
so you're thinking hyper extension you

302
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
so you're thinking hyper extension you
 

303
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,190
so you're thinking hyper extension you
feel that and then either he goes or I'm

304
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,200
feel that and then either he goes or I'm
 

305
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,430
feel that and then either he goes or I'm
going to break his arm right so you go

306
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:24,440
going to break his arm right so you go
 

307
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,350
going to break his arm right so you go
like you're thinking

308
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,360
like you're thinking
 

309
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,069
like you're thinking
that do you understand that's not

310
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,079
that do you understand that's not
 

311
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,269
that do you understand that's not
you can't throw someone with a joint

312
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:34,279
you can't throw someone with a joint
 

313
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,710
you can't throw someone with a joint
thread you might break it now you're not

314
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
thread you might break it now you're not
 

315
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,990
thread you might break it now you're not
throwing them does that make sense okay

316
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
throwing them does that make sense okay
 

317
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,230
throwing them does that make sense okay
so you're not trying to break the

318
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,240
so you're not trying to break the
 

319
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,630
so you're not trying to break the
arm what I'm going to

320
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:45,640
arm what I'm going to
 

321
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,509
arm what I'm going to
do if you pay

322
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519

 

323
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,269

attention you go in here his elbow is

324
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
attention you go in here his elbow is
 

325
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,990
attention you go in here his elbow is
now on

326
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,000
now on
 

327
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,110
now on
top you get that and there's my angle of

328
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120
top you get that and there's my angle of
 

329
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,590
top you get that and there's my angle of
cancellation so we have this angle

330
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
cancellation so we have this angle
 

331
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,310
cancellation so we have this angle
cancellation where I create a zone of s

332
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
cancellation where I create a zone of s
 

333
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,750
cancellation where I create a zone of s
around this

334
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
around this
 

335
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,230
around this
corner right and then you have this

336
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
corner right and then you have this
 

337
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,230
corner right and then you have this
angle look same thing on this side okay

338
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
angle look same thing on this side okay
 

339
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,710
angle look same thing on this side okay
so his elbow's on top It's Not

340
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
so his elbow's on top It's Not
 

341
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,230
so his elbow's on top It's Not
underneath so when I come around I'm not

342
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
underneath so when I come around I'm not
 

343
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,990
underneath so when I come around I'm not
even on the elbow you see that okay

344
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
even on the elbow you see that okay
 

345
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,310
even on the elbow you see that okay
because what I'm trying to do is get

346
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
because what I'm trying to do is get
 

347
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,110
because what I'm trying to do is get
around on the in inside and trying to

348
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
around on the in inside and trying to
 

349
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,829
around on the in inside and trying to
get around on the inside

350
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
get around on the inside
 

351
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,230
get around on the inside
which will happen once this arm

352
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
which will happen once this arm
 

353
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,870
which will happen once this arm
continues to do it I'm going to get on

354
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
continues to do it I'm going to get on
 

355
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,389
continues to do it I'm going to get on
the inside feel feel okay and now

356
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
the inside feel feel okay and now
 

357
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,310
the inside feel feel okay and now
because this arm had to end up down

358
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
because this arm had to end up down
 

359
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,310
because this arm had to end up down
that's where that spiral creates the

360
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
that's where that spiral creates the
 

361
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,389
that's where that spiral creates the
adhesion do you see and so this this

362
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
adhesion do you see and so this this
 

363
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,030
adhesion do you see and so this this
adhesion is going to lower his

364
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040

 

365
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,949

head

366
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:01,959

 

367
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,430

boom I'm trying to get to the

368
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
boom I'm trying to get to the
 

369
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,550
boom I'm trying to get to the
inside and that spiral is going to lower

370
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
inside and that spiral is going to lower
 

371
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,790
inside and that spiral is going to lower
his head so don't I'm not going to

372
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
his head so don't I'm not going to
 

373
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,629
his head so don't I'm not going to
project you okay and I'll go slow and

374
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:13,639
project you okay and I'll go slow and
 

375
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,870
project you okay and I'll go slow and
you'll feel what I'm talking about okay

376
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:15,880
you'll feel what I'm talking about okay
 

377
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,430
you'll feel what I'm talking about okay
so you can see there's no I'm not on

378
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
so you can see there's no I'm not on
 

379
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,550
so you can see there's no I'm not on
your joint can you tell that okay so

380
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
your joint can you tell that okay so
 

381
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,310
your joint can you tell that okay so
we'll do it

382
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
we'll do it
 

383
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,430
we'll do it
slow okay and with this arm here I'm

384
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,440
slow okay and with this arm here I'm
 

385
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,590
slow okay and with this arm here I'm
going to aim his head down try to get

386
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
going to aim his head down try to get
 

387
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,030
going to aim his head down try to get
back up

388
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040

 

389
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,230

I told you not to

390
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240

 

391
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:55,670

roll one two I want this

392
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680

 

393
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,990

down don't roll you're so trained

394
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000

 

395
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,550

you shouldn't roll because I didn't do

396
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,560
you shouldn't roll because I didn't do
 

397
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,870
you shouldn't roll because I didn't do
the tops of Turvy I didn't kick over the

398
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
the tops of Turvy I didn't kick over the
 

399
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,470
the tops of Turvy I didn't kick over the
top you

400
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,480
top you
 

401
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,230
top you
understand I'm not going so fast that

402
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
understand I'm not going so fast that
 

403
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,910
understand I'm not going so fast that
you have to reconcile the

404
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:18,920

 

405
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:27,870

M lift up come back lift

406
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880

 

407
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:46,949

up

408
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959

 

409
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,269

try so uh now what I have to do is well

410
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:52,279
try so uh now what I have to do is well
 

411
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,590
try so uh now what I have to do is well
let's just we'll do one more on the on

412
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:54,600
let's just we'll do one more on the on
 

413
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,030
let's just we'll do one more on the on
the other arm okay so as you're coming

414
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
the other arm okay so as you're coming
 

415
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,790
the other arm okay so as you're coming
in there was a dow to it but the spiral

416
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
in there was a dow to it but the spiral
 

417
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,030
in there was a dow to it but the spiral
has an inwardness too so you want some

418
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,040
has an inwardness too so you want some
 

419
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,470
has an inwardness too so you want some
inwardness as we get to the fourth part

420
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:09,480
inwardness as we get to the fourth part
 

421
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,189
inwardness as we get to the fourth part
that's going to prove relevant okay so

422
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:12,199
that's going to prove relevant okay so
 

423
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,430
that's going to prove relevant okay so
we'll do one more on

424
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:14,440
we'll do one more on
 

425
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,269
we'll do one more on
this I know I'm going to have down I

426
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
this I know I'm going to have down I
 

427
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,790
this I know I'm going to have down I
know I'm not trying to break his arm in

428
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:19,800
know I'm not trying to break his arm in
 

429
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,509
know I'm not trying to break his arm in
fact I'm trying to get inside where

430
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
fact I'm trying to get inside where
 

431
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,350
fact I'm trying to get inside where
there is no joint okay and I know that's

432
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,360
there is no joint okay and I know that's
 

433
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,310
there is no joint okay and I know that's
aiming down but it has some some

434
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,320
aiming down but it has some some
 

435
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,110
aiming down but it has some some
inwardness to it because it is the

436
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
inwardness to it because it is the
 

437
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:40,430
inwardness to it because it is the
inward spiral

438
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,440

 

439
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,990

okay so if if I if I took this

440
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
okay so if if I if I took this
 

441
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,910
okay so if if I if I took this
out and just hooked

442
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
out and just hooked
 

443
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,030
out and just hooked
here boom and slamed someone down Bo

444
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,040
here boom and slamed someone down Bo
 

445
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,269
here boom and slamed someone down Bo
he's not going to roll but IO person

446
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:56,279
he's not going to roll but IO person
 

447
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,910
he's not going to roll but IO person
rolls do you get it

448
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
rolls do you get it
 

449
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,269
rolls do you get it
because the the the throwing geometry is

450
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:02,279
because the the the throwing geometry is
 

451
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,990
because the the the throwing geometry is
not there there's no Topsy turby element

452
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,000
not there there's no Topsy turby element
 

453
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,110
not there there's no Topsy turby element
there's just a downward element okay so

454
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,120
there's just a downward element okay so
 

455
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,189
there's just a downward element okay so
you have to remember don't start

456
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:10,199
you have to remember don't start
 

457
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,509
you have to remember don't start
emphasizing only the what you think is

458
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:12,519
emphasizing only the what you think is
 

459
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,350
emphasizing only the what you think is
the Y arm because at the end this

460
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360
the Y arm because at the end this
 

461
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,670
the Y arm because at the end this
becomes the young arm okay so you're

462
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
becomes the young arm okay so you're
 

463
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:27,670
becomes the young arm okay so you're
in P

464
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680

 

465
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,189

pop

466
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:30,199
pop
 

467
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,629
pop
you can you feel the downward now

468
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639

 

469
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,670

you all right let's we got to take a

470
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
you all right let's we got to take a
 

471
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,670
you all right let's we got to take a
step back so we already talked about the

472
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,680
step back so we already talked about the
 

473
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,509
step back so we already talked about the
uh inward

474
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:42,519
uh inward
 

475
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,870
uh inward
kazushi um and I'm going to go back to

476
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:45,880
kazushi um and I'm going to go back to
 

477
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,710
kazushi um and I'm going to go back to
it on the fourth on the fourth element

478
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
it on the fourth on the fourth element
 

479
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,069
it on the fourth on the fourth element
okay but on all of your throwing

480
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
okay but on all of your throwing
 

481
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,550
okay but on all of your throwing
architectures you should get what what I

482
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
architectures you should get what what I
 

483
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,910
architectures you should get what what I
now call a body lock okay um so let's do

484
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
now call a body lock okay um so let's do
 

485
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,749
now call a body lock okay um so let's do
this hand and I'll take that inward

486
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:02,759
this hand and I'll take that inward
 

487
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,350
this hand and I'll take that inward
spiral okay you see and I'm not going to

488
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,360
spiral okay you see and I'm not going to
 

489
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,629
spiral okay you see and I'm not going to
step

490
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:07,639
step
 

491
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,700
step
here and then accelerate him

492
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:11,710
here and then accelerate him
 

493
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,110
here and then accelerate him
[Music]

494
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
[Music]
 

495
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,389
[Music]
backwards there's going to be a

496
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
backwards there's going to be a
 

497
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,790
backwards there's going to be a
part where between this pressure you see

498
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
part where between this pressure you see
 

499
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,829
part where between this pressure you see
and this enter here I have him locked in

500
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
and this enter here I have him locked in
 

501
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,590
and this enter here I have him locked in
place

502
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
place
 

503
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:42,550
place
okay

504
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560

 

505

enter there you see that so I can't
enter where I

674
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
enter where I
 

675
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,110
enter where I
was it's somewhere over here

676
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
was it's somewhere over here
 

677
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,510
was it's somewhere over here
okay and then you would keep the

678
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
okay and then you would keep the
 

679
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,750
okay and then you would keep the
continuous so I want you to think about

680
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
continuous so I want you to think about
 

681
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,630
continuous so I want you to think about
that and then the other thing is as he's

682
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
that and then the other thing is as he's
 

683
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,950
that and then the other thing is as he's
pushing on me he's pushing on

684
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
pushing on me he's pushing on
 

685
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,870
pushing on me he's pushing on
me that push I keep going

686
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
me that push I keep going
 

687
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,909
me that push I keep going
around you understand don't stop

688
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:14,919
around you understand don't stop
 

689
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,269
around you understand don't stop
it don't go here then it waits for you

690
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:18,279
it don't go here then it waits for you
 

691
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,269
it don't go here then it waits for you
so you can

692
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:20,279
so you can
 

693
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,590
so you can
enter the the push just keeps flowing

694
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,600
enter the the push just keeps flowing
 

695
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,230
enter the the push just keeps flowing
around you get it so use those two

696
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,240
around you get it so use those two
 

697
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:41,110
around you get it so use those two
things so you can get who disc

698
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120

 

699
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,230

continuous continuous motion okay let's

700
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
continuous continuous motion okay let's
 

701
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,669
continuous continuous motion okay let's
try common

702
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
try common
 

703
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,710
try common
mistake and it really stems from being

704
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
mistake and it really stems from being
 

705
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,070
mistake and it really stems from being
attached to the 126 line and it might

706
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
attached to the 126 line and it might
 

707
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,510
attached to the 126 line and it might
carry over into this actual front

708
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:54,520
carry over into this actual front
 

709
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,710
carry over into this actual front
kazushi pattern okay and that is uh your

710
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
kazushi pattern okay and that is uh your
 

711
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,710
kazushi pattern okay and that is uh your
ten

712
00:21:59,710 --> 00:21:59,720
ten
 

713
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,870
ten
con do you're going like this and then

714
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
con do you're going like this and then
 

715
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,470
con do you're going like this and then
you would enter because you need all

716
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:05,480
you would enter because you need all
 

717
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,750
you would enter because you need all
that acceleration to get them to go

718
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
that acceleration to get them to go
 

719
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,470
that acceleration to get them to go
forward

720
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
forward
 

721
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,110
forward
okay you get it so you're here like this

722
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
okay you get it so you're here like this
 

723
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,310
okay you get it so you're here like this
you do kind of turn here he falls there

724
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
you do kind of turn here he falls there
 

725
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,549
you do kind of turn here he falls there
and then you come in but that's not

726
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
and then you come in but that's not
 

727
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,950
and then you come in but that's not
going to work for this one cuz cuz

728
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
going to work for this one cuz cuz
 

729
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,390
going to work for this one cuz cuz
you're not you're not generating a

730
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,400
you're not you're not generating a
 

731
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,830
you're not you're not generating a
single pivot point so he can't go around

732
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
single pivot point so he can't go around
 

733
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,750
single pivot point so he can't go around
you okay so

734
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:28,760
you okay so
 

735
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,390
you okay so
so then the other common mistake is on

736
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
so then the other common mistake is on
 

737
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,830
so then the other common mistake is on
an a choreograph you is you would

738
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
an a choreograph you is you would
 

739
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,269
an a choreograph you is you would
enter 10 con and then you get 6 in of

740
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:41,279
enter 10 con and then you get 6 in of
 

741
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,190
enter 10 con and then you get 6 in of
EDI and then he would throw himself

742
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200

 

743
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,789

okay ten con does not

744
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:51,799
okay ten con does not
 

745
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,990
okay ten con does not
mean enter and then being comma over

746
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
mean enter and then being comma over
 

747
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,390
mean enter and then being comma over
here that's not what ten conies ten comp

748
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
here that's not what ten conies ten comp
 

749
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,110
here that's not what ten conies ten comp
means just to change to change the

750
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
means just to change to change the
 

751
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,950
means just to change to change the
relationship okay

752
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
relationship okay
 

753
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,710
relationship okay
so right now my right hip's my front hip

754
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
so right now my right hip's my front hip
 

755
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,909
so right now my right hip's my front hip

757
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,789
you see so when I turn now my left hip's
my front hip that's ten con okay that if

758
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:15,799
my front hip that's ten con okay that if
 

759
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,310
my front hip that's ten con okay that if
you're like I can't let go ten con and

760
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,320
you're like I can't let go ten con and
 

761
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,350
you're like I can't let go ten con and
this is how to better understand it okay

762
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,360
this is how to better understand it okay
 

763
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,190
this is how to better understand it okay
so now I I put my other foot in the box

764
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
so now I I put my other foot in the box
 

765
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,909
so now I I put my other foot in the box
with this hip forward some of you have

766
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
with this hip forward some of you have
 

767
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,830
with this hip forward some of you have
your foot right in the back and you're

768
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
your foot right in the back and you're
 

769
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,390
your foot right in the back and you're
not in this but you're over here and

770
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:35,400
not in this but you're over here and
 

771
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,830
not in this but you're over here and
this is not a clear front hip so it's

772
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
this is not a clear front hip so it's
 

773
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,750
this is not a clear front hip so it's
very hard now to cross across this hip

774
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:40,760
very hard now to cross across this hip
 

775
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,149
very hard now to cross across this hip
okay this hip has to go in the back do

776
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:43,159
okay this hip has to go in the back do
 

777
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:49,190
okay this hip has to go in the back do
you see and then I can make my circle

778
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200

 

779
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,870

around so as I'm going you see it's

780
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880

 

781
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,190

easyy watching my feet

782
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
easyy watching my feet
 

783
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,070
easyy watching my feet
boom okay then now my this hip is

784
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
boom okay then now my this hip is
 

785
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,070
boom okay then now my this hip is
clearly forward this hip is back and now

786
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,080
clearly forward this hip is back and now
 

787
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,430
clearly forward this hip is back and now
I can enter on my usual curve on all of

788
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:10,440
I can enter on my usual curve on all of
 

789
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,630
I can enter on my usual curve on all of
my techniques right so it's over

790
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:13,640
my techniques right so it's over
 

791
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,350
my techniques right so it's over
here okay got it so let's clean up that

792
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
here okay got it so let's clean up that
 

793
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,000
here okay got it so let's clean up that
ten con go
