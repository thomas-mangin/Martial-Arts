87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,240

so what when you do dude you have one

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,250
so what when you do dude you have one
 

89
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:40,760
so what when you do dude you have one
animal it's horizontal the more you can

animal it's horizontal the more you can
 

91
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,850
animal it's horizontal the more you can
stick in so here I have my angle

92
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:43,860
stick in so here I have my angle
 

93
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,390
stick in so here I have my angle
translation by angle disturbance my

94
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
translation by angle disturbance my
 

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,850
translation by angle disturbance my
double power my body movement

96
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:49,860
double power my body movement
 

97
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,890

here's my tiny step of evening and I get

98
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
here's my tiny step of evening and I get
 

99
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:02,240
here's my tiny step of evening and I get
a lot of reaction out of it and then I

a lot of reaction out of it and then I
 

101
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:18,339
a lot of reaction out of it and then I
go up to chewed on turn my wrist I

102

I have the singing elbow in tension

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,260

 

133
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,210

it's all in my elbow power you get your

134
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,220
it's all in my elbow power you get your
 

135
00:08:46,220 --> 00:09:32,249
it's all in my elbow power you get your
attention

136
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:32,259

 

137
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:38,829

so each one whatever you're doing some

so each one whatever you're doing some
 

139
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:55,710
so each one whatever you're doing some
of them are different I have to learn to

140
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
of them are different I have to learn to
 

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,049
of them are different I have to learn to
blend with the closing of this fingers

142
00:09:59,049 --> 00:09:59,059
blend with the closing of this fingers
 

143
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,579
blend with the closing of this fingers
and the initial intention which cannot

144
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:03,589
and the initial intention which cannot
 

145
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:07,660
and the initial intention which cannot
happen with my hands still in space my

146
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,670
happen with my hands still in space my
 

147
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,739
happen with my hands still in space my
hands still in space right is a point of

148
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:11,749
hands still in space right is a point of
 

149
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:14,290
hands still in space right is a point of
contention that's setting up the problem

150
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,300
contention that's setting up the problem
 

151
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,389
contention that's setting up the problem
of the technique so if I don't do

152
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
of the technique so if I don't do
 

153
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,869
of the technique so if I don't do
anything to my hand then I'm going to

154
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:19,879
anything to my hand then I'm going to
 

155
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,129
anything to my hand then I'm going to
have that clock

156
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:21,139
have that clock
 

157
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,819
have that clock
you know I understand that so my hand

158
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:24,829
you know I understand that so my hand
 

159
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,519
you know I understand that so my hand

00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:03,859
learning it right in there
 

175
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,869
learning it right in there
when you do it like this

176

okay

180
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,450

 

181
00:11:48,450 --> 00:12:47,990

you

182
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000

 

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,829

oh my it's got to have enough connection

184
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,839
oh my it's got to have enough connection

where he will condition my body
 

187
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:00,650
where he will condition my body
so if people's let's that disconnects

188
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:00,660
so if people's let's that disconnects
 

189
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,110
so if people's let's that disconnects
that you don't get you're not gonna get

190
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
that you don't get you're not gonna get
 

191
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:25,000
that you don't get you're not gonna get
it

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,010

 

193
00:13:25,010 --> 00:14:10,200

you

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,210

 

195
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,210

you should not take a parallel angle

196
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,220
you should not take a parallel angle
 

197
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,820
you should not take a parallel angle
where you're moving that way and he's

198
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,830
where you're moving that way and he's
 

199
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,280
where you're moving that way and he's
moving that way and then you're going to

200
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,290
moving that way and then you're going to
 

201
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,090
moving that way and then you're going to
catch up to him that's not what's

202
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,100
catch up to him that's not what's
 

203
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,190
catch up to him that's not what's
happening so here you have already a

204
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,200
happening so here you have already a
 

205
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,160
happening so here you have already a
variation on that he's not going that

206
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,170
variation on that he's not going that
 

207
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,310
variation on that he's not going that
way you understand he's going that way

208
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,320
way you understand he's going that way
 

209
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,410
way you understand he's going that way
so as I come around like that then I

210
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:38,420
so as I come around like that then I
 

211
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,910
so as I come around like that then I
don't go that way

212
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
don't go that way
 

213
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,060
don't go that way
he's going that way and I go this way

214
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,070
he's going that way and I go this way
 

215
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:50,460
he's going that way and I go this way
and then I miss him he's going around me

216
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:50,470
and then I miss him he's going around me
 

217
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,440
and then I miss him he's going around me
so I have to go around that leave center

218
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,450
so I have to go around that leave center
 

219
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,050
so I have to go around that leave center
point you understand that so I'm not

220
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,060
point you understand that so I'm not
 

221
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,360
point you understand that so I'm not
going here we're going around on the

222
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,370
going here we're going around on the
 

223
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,630
going here we're going around on the
point in space about there okay right

224
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:04,640
point in space about there okay right
 

225
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,690
point in space about there okay right
where this Kazushi angle is that's where

226
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:07,700
where this Kazushi angle is that's where
 

227
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,860
where this Kazushi angle is that's where
we're going

228
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:10,870

 

229
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,440

so I'm attacking him I'm not deviating

230
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,450
so I'm attacking him I'm not deviating
 

231
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,880
so I'm attacking him I'm not deviating
and hoping to catch him

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:18,890
and hoping to catch him
 

233
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,360
and hoping to catch him
I am aggressive motion which goes back

234
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,370
I am aggressive motion which goes back
 

235
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:39,820
I am aggressive motion which goes back
to my front foot so home okay let's

236
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:39,830

 

237
