call leading okay um um and the way that

32
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
call leading okay um um and the way that
 

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,750
call leading okay um um and the way that
I Define all of this is that's an that's

34
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
I Define all of this is that's an that's
 

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,469
I Define all of this is that's an that's
an an an example of the choreography and

36
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
an an an example of the choreography and
 

37
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,190
an an an example of the choreography and
then the way I Define

38
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
then the way I Define
 

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,870
then the way I Define
choreography is that the reconciling of

40
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
choreography is that the reconciling of
 

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,510
choreography is that the reconciling of
Yin and yangong is placed upon UK uh

42
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
Yin and yangong is placed upon UK uh
 

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,550
Yin and yangong is placed upon UK uh
that is not how we train here the

44
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
that is not how we train here the
 

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,270
that is not how we train here the
reconciling of

46
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
reconciling of
 

47
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,270
reconciling of
yinong is placed upon nag okay so um if

48
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,280
yinong is placed upon nag okay so um if
 

49
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,749

this is my UK and I am trying to apply a

50
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:34,759
this is my UK and I am trying to apply a
 

51
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,149
this is my UK and I am trying to apply a
technique on them that requires them to

52
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,159
technique on them that requires them to
 

53
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,830
technique on them that requires them to
be moved from position a to position

54
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
be moved from position a to position
 

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,670
be moved from position a to position
B um I'll give you the examples

56
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
B um I'll give you the examples
 

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,310
B um I'll give you the examples
abstractly of the modern UK who

58
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
abstractly of the modern UK who
 

59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,670
abstractly of the modern UK who
reconciles the energy okay so here's

60
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
reconciles the energy okay so here's
 

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,510
reconciles the energy okay so here's
position a and I want to move him to

62
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,520
position a and I want to move him to
 

63
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,630
position a and I want to move him to
position b a meter over to his right

64
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
position b a meter over to his right
 

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,630
position b a meter over to his right
so some of the things that we do is he's

66
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
so some of the things that we do is he's
 

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,309
so some of the things that we do is he's
going to follow my hand you see um we

68
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
going to follow my hand you see um we
 

69
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,509
going to follow my hand you see um we
don't want that we don't we

70
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:13,519
don't want that we don't we
 

71
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:18,309
don't want that we don't we
don't um lead UK they don't

72
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
don't um lead UK they don't
 

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,869
don't um lead UK they don't
fill the yin space they they don't do

74
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:21,879
fill the yin space they they don't do
 

75
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,309
fill the yin space they they don't do
that okay

76
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
that okay
 

77
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,390
that okay
uh that's just wrong okay then but

78
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
uh that's just wrong okay then but
 

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,550
uh that's just wrong okay then but
however uh the the other one

80
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
however uh the the other one
 

81
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,110
however uh the the other one
is um UK also does not let's

82
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,120
is um UK also does not let's
 

83
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,190
is um UK also does not let's
say that I'm pushing

84
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
say that I'm pushing
 

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,070
say that I'm pushing
him right I'll do it

86
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,080
him right I'll do it
 

87
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,470
him right I'll do it
okay he has the intention of pushing me

88
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
okay he has the intention of pushing me
 

89
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,229
okay he has the intention of pushing me
over there I don't also don't just go

90
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:53,239
over there I don't also don't just go
 

91
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,390
over there I don't also don't just go
okay so walk walk me over there walk me

92
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
okay so walk walk me over there walk me
 

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,470
okay so walk walk me over there walk me
I'm not doing this okay

94
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm not doing this okay
 

95
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,990
I'm not doing this okay
I and what I'm doing here is uh if you

96
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,000
I and what I'm doing here is uh if you
 

97
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,270
I and what I'm doing here is uh if you
pay attention as he's walking me over

98
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
pay attention as he's walking me over
 

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,750
pay attention as he's walking me over
I'm walking to keep that

100
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm walking to keep that
 

101
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,430
I'm walking to keep that
okay what would what would normally

102
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
okay what would what would normally
 

103
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,789
okay what would what would normally
happen is if I leave my feet here and he

104
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:19,799
happen is if I leave my feet here and he
 

105
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,190
happen is if I leave my feet here and he
pushed above my center of gravity my

106
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
pushed above my center of gravity my
 

107
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,589
pushed above my center of gravity my
head would tilt go ahead and you would

108
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
head would tilt go ahead and you would
 

109
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,670
head would tilt go ahead and you would
see that instead okay

110
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:30,680
see that instead okay
 

111
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,750
see that instead okay
um as opposed to he's walking me over

112
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
um as opposed to he's walking me over
 

113
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,550
um as opposed to he's walking me over
and I'm walking like that that that is

114
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
and I'm walking like that that that is
 

115
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,229
and I'm walking like that that that is
me still

116
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
me still
 

117
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,030
me still
reconciling the uh Yang energy

118
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040

 

119
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,589

okay but we also so I don't want my UK

120
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599
okay but we also so I don't want my UK
 

121
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,830
okay but we also so I don't want my UK
doing that I don't want them reconciling

122
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
doing that I don't want them reconciling
 

123
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,429
doing that I don't want them reconciling
the yin and yang either way positively

as he's trying to push doing this stuff

130
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:06,760
as he's trying to push doing this stuff
 

131
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,670
as he's trying to push doing this stuff
okay um I don't want them changing the

132

okay um I don't want them changing the
 

133
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,229
okay um I don't want them changing the
force equation that is given in the in

134
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:13,239
force equation that is given in the in
 

135
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,030
force equation that is given in the in
the moment uh at all so I don't want

136
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
the moment uh at all so I don't want
 

137
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,950
the moment uh at all so I don't want
them generating higher Y and also he's

138
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
them generating higher Y and also he's
 

139
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,510
them generating higher Y and also he's
trying to push me I don't want them to

140
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,520
trying to push me I don't want them to

do

142
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,440
do
 

143
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,510
do
that change changing the force value

144
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
that change changing the force value
 

145
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,710
that change changing the force value
that's what that is do you see uh and he

146
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
that's what that is do you see uh and he
 

147
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,430
that's what that is do you see uh and he
goes and I don't want to doing this I

148
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,440
goes and I don't want to doing this I
 

149
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,350
goes and I don't want to doing this I
don't want them to change the force

150
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,360
don't want them to change the force
 

151
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,230
don't want them to change the force
value if you pay

152
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,240
value if you pay
 

153
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,189
value if you pay
attention in my first

154
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,199
attention in my first
 

155
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,469
attention in my first
example this is his Force value and UK

156
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
example this is his Force value and UK
 

157
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,070
example this is his Force value and UK
is changing the force

158
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
is changing the force
 

159
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,909
is changing the force
value if UK does not change the force

160
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:56,919
value if UK does not change the force
 

161
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,870
value if UK does not change the force
value nothing happens you

162
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
value nothing happens you
 

163
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,590
value nothing happens you

protocol um because either way that's

268
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:52,159
protocol um because either way that's
 

269
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,070
protocol um because either way that's
the problem we don't do that

270
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,080
the problem we don't do that
 

271
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,270
the problem we don't do that
okay um

272
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
okay um
 

273
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,909
okay um
so if you're do doing for example koku

274
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:02,919
so if you're do doing for example koku
 

275
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,270
so if you're do doing for example koku
ho okay and uh he's coming

276
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
ho okay and uh he's coming
 

277
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,070
ho okay and uh he's coming
in and here we have this force in the

278
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
in and here we have this force in the
 

279
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,589
in and here we have this force in the
ferite so here here the ferite already

here I he has some tilts but as he goes
 

293
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,470
here I he has some tilts but as he goes
backwards I'm here and I don't have to

294
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
backwards I'm here and I don't have to
 

295
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,470
backwards I'm here and I don't have to
change the energy he he just runs into

change the energy he he just runs into
 

297
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,910
change the energy he he just runs into
that energy do I look like I'm trying

298
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
that energy do I look like I'm trying
 

299
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,150
that energy do I look like I'm trying
I'm not trying but I'm stand handy

300
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
I'm not trying but I'm stand handy
 

301
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,870

that's all that's
 

303
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,310
that's all that's
happening what the fedorite UK will

304
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,320
happening what the fedorite UK will
 

305
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,910
happening what the fedorite UK will
do is at the pressure coming back they

306
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:08,920
do is at the pressure coming back they
 

307
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,389
do is at the pressure coming back they
will do

308
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399

 

309
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,230

that if he's going

310
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
that if he's going
 

311

see but we we wouldn't change the
 

317
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,670
see but we we wouldn't change the
pressure so as meaning this is my

318
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,680
pressure so as meaning this is my
 

319
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,230
pressure so as meaning this is my
relationship as he goes to

body so that's the result okay it's very

328
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
body so that's the result okay it's very
 

329
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,590
body so that's the result okay it's very
similar to

330
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600

 

331
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,430

this if I want to move him that one m i

332
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
this if I want to move him that one m i
 

333
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,389
this if I want to move him that one m i
pick him

334
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399

 

335
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,470

up and I moved him a meter he did not

336
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
up and I moved him a meter he did not
 

337
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,350
up and I moved him a meter he did not
have to try he did not fight it right so

338
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
have to try he did not fight it right so
 

339
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,310
have to try he did not fight it right so
he didn't drop his weight and make it

340
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
he didn't drop his weight and make it
 

341
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,870
he didn't drop his weight and make it
extra hard for me but I moved him a

342
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:17,880
extra hard for me but I moved him a
 

343
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,470
extra hard for me but I moved him a
meter

344
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,480
meter
 

345
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,110
meter
okay so as you guys are trying our

346
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
okay so as you guys are trying our
 

347
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,630
okay so as you guys are trying our
techniques you have to be careful of

348
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
techniques you have to be careful of
 

349
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,870
techniques you have to be careful of
your old style of Emi

350
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:29,880
your old style of Emi
 

351
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,590
your old style of Emi
where he goes and then you're

352
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:34,600
where he goes and then you're
 

353
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,590
where he goes and then you're
this okay because if the UK does that

354
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
this okay because if the UK does that
 

355
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,269
this okay because if the UK does that
you will not see the need for what we do

356
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
you will not see the need for what we do
 

357
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,629
you will not see the need for what we do
instead and so you won't do what we do

358
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:46,639
instead and so you won't do what we do
 

359
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,350
instead and so you won't do what we do
instead and you're still practicing

360
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
instead and you're still practicing
 

361
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,829
instead and you're still practicing
something that is fake

362
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
something that is fake
 

363
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,910
something that is fake
okay um fakeness is not as innocent as

364
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
okay um fakeness is not as innocent as
 

365
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,230
okay um fakeness is not as innocent as
we think it's not the problem with

366
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
we think it's not the problem with
 

367
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,870
we think it's not the problem with
fakeness isn't that your art is not

368
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:03,880
fakeness isn't that your art is not
 

369
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,550
fakeness isn't that your art is not
Marshal the problem with fakeness is

370
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:09,560
Marshal the problem with fakeness is
 

371
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,790
Marshal the problem with fakeness is
the role that delusion plays in the

372
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:13,800
the role that delusion plays in the
 

373
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,269
the role that delusion plays in the
construction of self and you are in a

374
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
construction of self and you are in a
 

375
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,509
construction of self and you are in a
practice that is involving the

376
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
practice that is involving the
 

377
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,509
practice that is involving the
deconstruction of self so you cannot

378
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
deconstruction of self so you cannot
 

379
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,870
deconstruction of self so you cannot
separate um the deconstruction of self

380
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
separate um the deconstruction of self
 

381
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,030
separate um the deconstruction of self
from The Pursuit Of Truth

382
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,040
from The Pursuit Of Truth
 

383
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,350
from The Pursuit Of Truth
if you are doing something superficial

384
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
if you are doing something superficial
 

385
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,790
if you are doing something superficial
masquerade fraudulent

386
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:35,800
masquerade fraudulent
 

387
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,150
masquerade fraudulent
faral uh the self is always going to be

388
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
faral uh the self is always going to be
 

389
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,350
faral uh the self is always going to be
the driving force for the shape that

390
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
the driving force for the shape that
 

391
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,470
the driving force for the shape that
takes and therefore the self is being

392
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
takes and therefore the self is being
 

393
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,910
takes and therefore the self is being
reified and constructed through farce

394
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:46,920
reified and constructed through farce
 

395
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,590
reified and constructed through farce
through fabrication through

through fabrication through
 

397
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,550
through fabrication through
superficiality okay so it's not so

398
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
superficiality okay so it's not so
 

399
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,870
superficiality okay so it's not so
innocent when we stop our Pursuit Of

400
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:55,880
innocent when we stop our Pursuit Of
 

401
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,069
innocent when we stop our Pursuit Of
Truth and we start doing something else

402
00:11:59,069 --> 00:11:59,079
Truth and we start doing something else
 

403
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,269
Truth and we start doing something else
okay okay that's the real problem so uh

404
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
okay okay that's the real problem so uh
 

405
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,230
okay okay that's the real problem so uh
when I do this and uh again I got to

406
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,240
when I do this and uh again I got to
 

407
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,829
when I do this and uh again I got to
show what to do um when you feel that

408
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:10,839
show what to do um when you feel that
 

409
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,590
show what to do um when you feel that
pressure he bent his back and you see

410
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:14,600
pressure he bent his back and you see
 

411
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,990
pressure he bent his back and you see
this Bo in his back we that is a sign

412
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,000
this Bo in his back we that is a sign
 

413
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,790
this Bo in his back we that is a sign
that this is okay people do not

414
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
that this is okay people do not
 

415
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,230
that this is okay people do not
bow their backs that are attacking you

416
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,240
bow their backs that are attacking you
 

417
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,230
bow their backs that are attacking you
um they do everything they can to not

418
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
um they do everything they can to not
 

419
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,350
um they do everything they can to not
bend their backs okay so if you pay

420
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
bend their backs okay so if you pay
 

421
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,750
bend their backs okay so if you pay
attention in our throwing

422
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
attention in our throwing
 

423
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,750
attention in our throwing
architectures um their back stays

424
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
architectures um their back stays
 

425
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,230
architectures um their back stays
straight we don't try to bend their

426
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
straight we don't try to bend their
 

427
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,230
straight we don't try to bend their
backs okay so kinaga for example he

428
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
backs okay so kinaga for example he
 

429
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,990
backs okay so kinaga for example he
doesn't Bend his back

430
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,000
doesn't Bend his back
 

431
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,870
doesn't Bend his back
please he doesn't do that uh and then I

432
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:53,880
please he doesn't do that uh and then I
 

433
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,350
please he doesn't do that uh and then I
get my mechanical leverage to throw him

434
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
get my mechanical leverage to throw him
 

435
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,470
get my mechanical leverage to throw him
uh so if you you and this is something

436
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
uh so if you you and this is something
 

437
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,710
uh so if you you and this is something
that's easily observable as you're

438
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
that's easily observable as you're
 

439
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,629
that's easily observable as you're
practicing uh did my UK bend their back

440
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:07,639
practicing uh did my UK bend their back
 

441
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,910
practicing uh did my UK bend their back
in that bow shape or bent forward in

442
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:10,920
in that bow shape or bent forward in
 

443
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,430
in that bow shape or bent forward in
that bow shape then chances are they

444
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
that bow shape then chances are they
 

445
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,430
that bow shape then chances are they
reconciled the uh technique then chances

446
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
reconciled the uh technique then chances
 

447
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,829
reconciled the uh technique then chances
are I'm doing a different geometry a

448
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:22,839
are I'm doing a different geometry a
 

449
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,870
are I'm doing a different geometry a
different throwing architecture than

450
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
different throwing architecture than
 

451
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,030
different throwing architecture than
what Dave is doing okay so um and here's

452
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,040
what Dave is doing okay so um and here's
 

453
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,230
what Dave is doing okay so um and here's
why if you pay attention and you go here

454
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
why if you pay attention and you go here
 

455
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,269
why if you pay attention and you go here
there's no freaking mechanical advantage

456
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
there's no freaking mechanical advantage
 

457
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,910
there's no freaking mechanical advantage
here um I I can't do

458
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920
here um I I can't do
 

459
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,389
here um I I can't do
 against him there's no way but if

460
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
against him there's no way but if
 

461
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,910
against him there's no way but if
he bends his back enough then then I can

462
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:48,920
he bends his back enough then then I can
 

463
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,749
he bends his back enough then then I can
I can get that going okay um can you can

464
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:53,759
I can get that going okay um can you can
 

465
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,269
I can get that going okay um can you can
you do that can you just spend your back

466
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:56,279
you do that can you just spend your back
 

467
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,550
you do that can you just spend your back
okay so I I I touch you back and then

468
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
okay so I I I touch you back and then
 

469
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,749
okay so I I I touch you back and then
and now I feel like I'm I am so doing do

470
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:07,759
and now I feel like I'm I am so doing do
 

471
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,829
and now I feel like I'm I am so doing do
you see um but it's not as far as

472
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
you see um but it's not as far as
 

473
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,350
you see um but it's not as far as
self-construct uh it's okay

474
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
self-construct uh it's okay
 

475
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,629
self-construct uh it's okay
what we do

476
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
what we do
 

477
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,829
what we do
instead is I get a tilt and that is the

478
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
instead is I get a tilt and that is the
 

479
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,790
instead is I get a tilt and that is the
contention point and so that's that's

480
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
contention point and so that's that's
 

481
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,389
contention point and so that's that's
what I have to turn this straight line I

482
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,399
what I have to turn this straight line I
 

483
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,110
what I have to turn this straight line I
have to spiral rotate this um tonden and

484
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,120
have to spiral rotate this um tonden and
 

485
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,870
have to spiral rotate this um tonden and
not push back and not expect him to bow

486
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:37,880
not push back and not expect him to bow
 

487
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,629
not push back and not expect him to bow
for me okay and we have this same thing

488
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:41,639
for me okay and we have this same thing
 

489
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,269
for me okay and we have this same thing
so uh

490
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
so uh
 

491
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,150
so uh
uh this is rampid in every video

492
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
uh this is rampid in every video
 

493
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,389
uh this is rampid in every video
everyone sending me but um because you

494
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,399
everyone sending me but um because you
 

495
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,870
everyone sending me but um because you
guys were kind enough to send them uh

496
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:53,880
guys were kind enough to send them uh
 

497
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,790
guys were kind enough to send them uh
Karen and Noah I would look for that and

498
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
Karen and Noah I would look for that and
 

499
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,230
Karen and Noah I would look for that and
then uh Kathy and Ivan I would I would

500
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,240
then uh Kathy and Ivan I would I would
 

501
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,590
then uh Kathy and Ivan I would I would
look for it too okay uh and again if

502
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:02,600
look for it too okay uh and again if
 

503
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,150
look for it too okay uh and again if
you're trying to learn the architectures

504
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,160
you're trying to learn the architectures
 

505
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,110
you're trying to learn the architectures
if he

506
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,120
if he
 

507
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,790
if he
bows then you throw this one but we

508
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:09,800
bows then you throw this one but we
 

509
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,550
bows then you throw this one but we
don't do that I have to spiral rotate

510
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
don't do that I have to spiral rotate
 

511
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,990
don't do that I have to spiral rotate
the

512
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000

270°
 

515
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,749
270°
um in in my throwing architectures which

516
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:18,759
um in in my throwing architectures which
 

517
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,990
um in in my throwing architectures which
I have to do to get that tonden turning

518
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
I have to do to get that tonden turning
 

519
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,030
I have to do to get that tonden turning
to change my Consciousness okay

520
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,040
to change my Consciousness okay
 

521
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,509
to change my Consciousness okay
um EO is something else like here here I

522
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:32,519
um EO is something else like here here I
 

523
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,030
um EO is something else like here here I
go right and you see how he's bending

524
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,040
go right and you see how he's bending
 

525
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,590
go right and you see how he's bending
forward like that okay and we'll take it

526
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
forward like that okay and we'll take it
 

527
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,350
forward like that okay and we'll take it
because it put the elbow so low that I

528
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,360
because it put the elbow so low that I
 

529
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,509
because it put the elbow so low that I
can get on top of it and use gravity to

530
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:48,519
can get on top of it and use gravity to
 

531
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,030
can get on top of it and use gravity to
make that work

532
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
make that work
 

533
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,829
make that work
okay um and you don't that's not what

534
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
okay um and you don't that's not what
 

535
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,189
okay um and you don't that's not what
you're trying to do in the technique so

536
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,199
you're trying to do in the technique so
 

537
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,309
you're trying to do in the technique so
if you pay attention on tensin I just

538
00:15:59,309 --> 00:15:59,319
if you pay attention on tensin I just
 

539
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,870
if you pay attention on tensin I just
that tilt that's it that's all I need to

540
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:01,880
that tilt that's it that's all I need to
 

541
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,389
that tilt that's it that's all I need to
start spiral rotating his Center into

542
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
start spiral rotating his Center into
 

543
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,150
start spiral rotating his Center into
the throws that you saw in that recent

544
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
the throws that you saw in that recent
 

545
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,509
the throws that you saw in that recent
video so I don't need his so compromised

546
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:10,519
video so I don't need his so compromised
 

547
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,110
video so I don't need his so compromised
to throw and

548
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
to throw and
 

549
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,430
to throw and
likewise when I'm in his Center this

550
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
likewise when I'm in his Center this
 

551
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,430
likewise when I'm in his Center this
elbow isn't going to get all the way

552
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
elbow isn't going to get all the way
 

553
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,870
elbow isn't going to get all the way
down to where I can get on top of it

554
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
down to where I can get on top of it
 

555
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,870
down to where I can get on top of it
okay so don't sit here and try to get

556
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:27,880
okay so don't sit here and try to get
 

557
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,550
okay so don't sit here and try to get
that to to wear it's down like

558
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:31,560
that to to wear it's down like
 

559
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,309
that to to wear it's down like
that you're going to generate the same

560
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
that you're going to generate the same
 

561
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,030
that you're going to generate the same
turn the same tilt in his body so look

562
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040
turn the same tilt in his body so look
 

563
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,550
turn the same tilt in his body so look
how high it is so don't try you don't

564
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:41,560
how high it is so don't try you don't
 

565
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,350
how high it is so don't try you don't
try to shove this down same way but from

566
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
try to shove this down same way but from
 

567
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,030
try to shove this down same way but from
the front I have to spiral rotate this

568
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
the front I have to spiral rotate this
 

569
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,470
the front I have to spiral rotate this
Center so I don't push this out that way

570
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
Center so I don't push this out that way
 

571
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,309
Center so I don't push this out that way
I don't try to push it down I take it to

572
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:57,319
I don't try to push it down I take it to
 

573
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,269
I don't try to push it down I take it to

576
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
and it
 

577
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,590

lowers on its own

578
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
lowers on its own

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,070
walking I am changing
the force equations I just do the spinal

650
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
the force equations I just do the spinal
 

651
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,230
the force equations I just do the spinal
displacement again what's that look like

652
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
displacement again what's that look like
 

653
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,070
displacement again what's that look like
it looks like

654
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,080

 

655
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,830

this he does what he

656
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:20,840
this he does what he
 

657
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,350
this he does what he
does and this is where I

658
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360

 

659
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,710

am this is me trying to get control and

660
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
am this is me trying to get control and
 

661
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,950
am this is me trying to get control and
and change it and if you pay

662
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
and change it and if you pay
 

663
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,669
and change it and if you pay
attention while not as

664
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
attention while not as
 

665
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,110
attention while not as
extreme it's

666
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,120

 

667
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,430

there in the other

668
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:42,440
there in the other
 

669
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,270
there in the other
one my spine stays

670
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,280

 

671
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,390

straight which what happens in real

672
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,400
straight which what happens in real
 

673
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,070
straight which what happens in real
assaults okay

674
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080

 

675
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,390

um I think this is pling what we're

676
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,400
um I think this is pling what we're
 

677
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,430
um I think this is pling what we're
doing in tenin Ty heno and what we're

678
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
doing in tenin Ty heno and what we're
 

679
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,549
doing in tenin Ty heno and what we're
doing in EO okay think think about it a

680
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
doing in EO okay think think about it a
 

681
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,270
doing in EO okay think think about it a
little more rewatch the videos where

682
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
little more rewatch the videos where
 

683
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,710
little more rewatch the videos where
those were specifically

684
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
those were specifically
 

685
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,470
those were specifically
generated uh uh or address the

686
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
generated uh uh or address the
 

687
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,029
generated uh uh or address the
anatomical positioning and then um try

688
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
anatomical positioning and then um try
 

689
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,590
anatomical positioning and then um try
to not do anything anymore as UK you the

690
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:22,600
to not do anything anymore as UK you the
 

691
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,029
to not do anything anymore as UK you the
only thing you

692
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,039
only thing you
 

693
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,190
only thing you
do where you have agency as UK is the

694
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
do where you have agency as UK is the
 

695
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,350
do where you have agency as UK is the
initial

696
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,360
initial
 

697
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,950
initial
prescription that is it after that don't

698
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
prescription that is it after that don't
 

699
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,029
prescription that is it after that don't
positively or negatively affect the

700
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:38,039
positively or negatively affect the
 

701
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,549
positively or negatively affect the
force equations allow what's happening

702
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
force equations allow what's happening
 

703
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,909
force equations allow what's happening
to happen okay don't make things happen

704
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
to happen okay don't make things happen
 

705
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,190
to happen okay don't make things happen
don't assist things happen um no not not

706
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
don't assist things happen um no not not
 

707
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
