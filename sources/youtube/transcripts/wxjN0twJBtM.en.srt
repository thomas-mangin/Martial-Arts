00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,950
have to fill in the gap okay
so this is uh a drill on

46
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
so this is uh a drill on
 

47
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,030

the infinite kicking may be

50
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
the infinite kicking may be
 

51
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,230
the infinite kicking may be
something you use but it at the minimum

52
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
something you use but it at the minimum
 

53
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,190
something you use but it at the minimum
it's something that's

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
it's something that's
 

55
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,550
it's something that's
looming so a guy cannot just

what to do they have to press
 

63
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,910
what to do they have to press
because if they don't they have

because if they don't they have
 

65
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,670
because if they don't they have
infighting kicking to deal with just

66

infighting kicking to deal with just
 

67
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,429
infighting kicking to deal with just
like they would have infighting elbows

68
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
like they would have infighting elbows
 

69
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,469
like they would have infighting elbows
and infighting

and infighting
hand strikes okay so there's three of

72
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
hand strikes okay so there's three of
 

73
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:47,830
hand strikes okay so there's three of
them

74
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
them
 

75
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,109
them
that we're doing now

76
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119

 

77
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,550

and they're going to help meet that

78
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
and they're going to help meet that
 

79
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,870
and they're going to help meet that
in-fighting self-defense situation where

80
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
in-fighting self-defense situation where
 

81
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,789
in-fighting self-defense situation where
they're tactically looming or they're

82
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
they're tactically looming or they're
 

83
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,469
they're tactically looming or they're
being tactically deployed

being tactically deployed
 

85
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,149
being tactically deployed
they don't have to be deployed in this

86
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
they don't have to be deployed in this
 

87
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,510
they don't have to be deployed in this
order in fact i would

88
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
order in fact i would
 

89
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,429
order in fact i would
imagine they wouldn't be this is just a

90
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
imagine they wouldn't be this is just a
 

91
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,030
imagine they wouldn't be this is just a
drill and as

92
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
drill and as
 

93
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,430
drill and as
a drill it's working on the coordination

94
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
a drill it's working on the coordination
 

95
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,190
a drill it's working on the coordination
that many aikidoka don't have because

96
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
that many aikidoka don't have because
 

97
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,150
that many aikidoka don't have because
you just have a curriculum made up of

98
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
you just have a curriculum made up of
 

99
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,350
you just have a curriculum made up of
very limited

100
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
very limited
 

101
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,350
very limited
movements okay but to do those movements

102
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
movements okay but to do those movements
 

103
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,949
movements okay but to do those movements
correctly i'm supposed to have an

athletic coordination
 

107
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,270
athletic coordination
so i find this interesting for those two

108
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
so i find this interesting for those two
 

109
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,830
so i find this interesting for those two
reasons

110
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
reasons
 

111
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,470
reasons
self-defense and let's improve our

112
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
self-defense and let's improve our
 

113
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,830

okay so this drill doesn't really work

116
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
okay so this drill doesn't really work
 

117
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,110
okay so this drill doesn't really work
on a bag because the nature of the kicks

118
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
on a bag because the nature of the kicks
 

119
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,869
on a bag because the nature of the kicks
although we can do a knee kick

120
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
although we can do a knee kick
 

121
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,910
although we can do a knee kick
on a bag uh but the next two kicks they

122
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
on a bag uh but the next two kicks they
 

123
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,589
on a bag uh but the next two kicks they
don't work so well on the back so

124
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
don't work so well on the back so
 

125
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,670
don't work so well on the back so
he's not really fighting me he's just a

so your toenails and stuff don't get
 

131
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,790
so your toenails and stuff don't get
ripped

of them
 

137
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,509
of them
because it's good for him to feel some

138
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
because it's good for him to feel some
 

139

161
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,030

uh there's energy so here i have forward

162
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
uh there's energy so here i have forward
 

163
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,430
uh there's energy so here i have forward
energy into the knee thrust so i use

164
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
energy into the knee thrust so i use
 

165
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,390
energy into the knee thrust so i use
that to come

166
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
that to come
 

167
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,070
that to come
in when i hit i use that energy to

168
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
in when i hit i use that energy to
 

169
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,710
in when i hit i use that energy to
rotate

170
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
rotate
 

171
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,390
rotate
boom and when it hits down i use the

172
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
boom and when it hits down i use the
 

173
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,309
boom and when it hits down i use the

rebound to help turn me
 

175
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,550
rebound to help turn me
so i'm transferring energy just like

176
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
so i'm transferring energy just like
 

177
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,509
so i'm transferring energy just like
when i do a

178
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
when i do a
 

179
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,670
when i do a
you throw me i transfer the energy into

180
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
you throw me i transfer the energy into
 

181
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,630
you throw me i transfer the energy into
the forward roll

182
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
the forward roll
 

183
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,830
the forward roll
so i'm not letting energy stop

184
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
so i'm not letting energy stop
 

185
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,830
so i'm not letting energy stop
and a new movement and then a new

186
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
and a new movement and then a new
 

187
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,710

so through i'm out
 

195
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,480
so through i'm out
