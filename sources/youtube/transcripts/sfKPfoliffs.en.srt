go to because the spiral can be

how far do you yield when he hits zero

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,469
how far do you yield when he hits zero
okay so he hits zero

you see how I did that same time okay

could be this way
 

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,330
could be this way
you see

78
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:47,340
you see
 

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,170
you see
right it doesn't matter

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,250
you're fading
you're fading into the spiral that's

you're fading into the spiral that's
 

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,130
you're fading into the spiral that's
that's the footwork you want that's the

90
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,140
that's the footwork you want that's the
 

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,550
that's the footwork you want that's the
the uh Thai sabaki One how do I Fade

92
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
the uh Thai sabaki One how do I Fade
 

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,869
the uh Thai sabaki One how do I Fade
Into the spider

94
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
Into the spider
 

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,690
Into the spider
okay

96
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:14,700

 

97
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,110

um

98
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,120

 

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,229

then the second one you have is the

100
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:21,239
then the second one you have is the
 

101
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,530
then the second one you have is the
question is how far do I pay fake when

102
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
question is how far do I pay fake when
 

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,450
question is how far do I pay fake when
he hits zero

104
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
he hits zero
 

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,469
he hits zero
okay so in other words I'm here oh

106
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
okay so in other words I'm here oh
 

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,629
okay so in other words I'm here oh
that's not zero

108
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
that's not zero
 

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,129
that's not zero
okay

110
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,139
okay
 

111
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:41,090
okay
so fade until he hits zero

112
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100

 

113
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:50,270

baby so this is

114
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,280

 

115
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,450

you could be around

116
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:53,460
you could be around
 

117
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,110
you could be around
Point what just shy of zero do you

118
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
Point what just shy of zero do you
 

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,689
Point what just shy of zero do you
understand

120
00:04:59,689 --> 00:04:59,699

you're gonna go here there's his head
 

141

143
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,790

see that

144
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
see that
 

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,670
see that
and that way he go he's he's not going

146
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
and that way he go he's he's not going
 

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,290
and that way he go he's he's not going
backwards yet you see he's not going

148
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,300
backwards yet you see he's not going
 

149
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,210
backwards yet you see he's not going
backwards but when I take his head

150
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:35,220
backwards but when I take his head
 

151
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,570
backwards but when I take his head
around then he's going backwards

152
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:41,580

 

153
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,810

then I can enter because he's going that

154
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820
then I can enter because he's going that
 

155
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,270
then I can enter because he's going that
way and I'm going with him he goes that

156
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
way and I'm going with him he goes that
 

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,310
way and I'm going with him he goes that
way he has a you know

158
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,320
way he has a you know
 

159
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,710
way he has a you know
if I if he's still going forward when I

160
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:51,720
if I if he's still going forward when I
 

161
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,749
if I if he's still going forward when I
enter this is a clash and you're just

162
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
enter this is a clash and you're just
 

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,969
enter this is a clash and you're just
trying to overpower someone he has to be

164
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:55,979
trying to overpower someone he has to be
 

165
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,950
trying to overpower someone he has to be
going the other way so

166
00:05:59,950 --> 00:05:59,960

 

167
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,189

without the entry you see okay

168
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
without the entry you see okay
 

169
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,370
without the entry you see okay
so when I enter don't enter where he's

170
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,380
so when I enter don't enter where he's
 

171
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,310
so when I enter don't enter where he's
falling

172
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,320

 

173
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,590

and not entering that

174
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
and not entering that
 

175
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,550
and not entering that
but you could

176
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560

 

177
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,050

but we're doing the Xbox

178
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,060

 

179
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,930

okay so head goes one way

180
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:26,940
okay so head goes one way
 

181
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:40,010
okay so head goes one way
well there it is

182

441
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,030

but reconciling fear

442
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040

 

443
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,550

that's a real thing

444
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560

 

445
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,730

we use it's a Bruto so we use

446
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:31,740
we use it's a Bruto so we use
 

447
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,569
we use it's a Bruto so we use
the training of martial arts

448
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:35,579
the training of martial arts
 

449
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,250
the training of martial arts
and here's the one the part you don't

450
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,260
and here's the one the part you don't
 

451
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,310
and here's the one the part you don't
like we we use the training in martial

452
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
like we we use the training in martial
 

453
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,689
like we we use the training in martial
arts

454
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:41,699
arts
 

455
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,090
arts
to generate fear in you

456
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,100
to generate fear in you
 

457
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,870
to generate fear in you
so that you can reconcile fear

458
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
so that you can reconcile fear
 

459
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,769
so that you can reconcile fear
you can't work on what you don't put on

460
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:54,779
you can't work on what you don't put on
 

461
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,150
you can't work on what you don't put on
the workbench

462
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,160

 

463
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,790

do you understand

464
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
do you understand
 

465
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,949
do you understand
so we use that training

466
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959

 

467
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,290

but the goal is not the martial arts

468
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,300
but the goal is not the martial arts
 

469
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,730
but the goal is not the martial arts
training

470
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:13,740

 

471
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,009

and so for that reason

472
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:16,019
and so for that reason
 

473
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,250
and so for that reason
it's wherever you're facing fear

474
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,260
it's wherever you're facing fear
 

475
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,230
it's wherever you're facing fear
that is the training

476
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,240
that is the training
 

477
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,930
that is the training
not the technique

478
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:23,940
not the technique
 

479
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,990
not the technique
or not just the technique

480
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
or not just the technique
 

481
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,530
or not just the technique
so sometimes it's

482
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:30,540
so sometimes it's
 

483
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,629
so sometimes it's
