00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559

 

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,350

Okay. So, I'm trying to do the same

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
Okay. So, I'm trying to do the same
 

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,070
Okay. So, I'm trying to do the same
thing in suadiwasa. I'm not going to do

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
thing in suadiwasa. I'm not going to do
 

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,109
thing in suadiwasa. I'm not going to do
another different thing. Okay. Your

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
another different thing. Okay. Your
 

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,910
another different thing. Okay. Your
angles because I'm not crossing as much

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
angles because I'm not crossing as much
 

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,830
angles because I'm not crossing as much
terrain. Your all your angles are going

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
terrain. Your all your angles are going
 

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,349
terrain. Your all your angles are going
to be shorter. Okay. Maybe even sharper,

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
to be shorter. Okay. Maybe even sharper,
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,950
to be shorter. Okay. Maybe even sharper,
smaller. Try try not to do like these

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
smaller. Try try not to do like these
 

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,590
smaller. Try try not to do like these
big things. See, it got soft. You see?

18
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
big things. See, it got soft. You see?
 

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,389
big things. See, it got soft. You see?
And then this is something else. Okay.

20
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
And then this is something else. Okay.
 

21
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,709
And then this is something else. Okay.
And now I'm chasing him because I went

22
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
And now I'm chasing him because I went
 

23
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,270
And now I'm chasing him because I went
too long on that angle. Do Do you

24
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,280
too long on that angle. Do Do you
 

25
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,790
too long on that angle. Do Do you
understand? Okay. So, I'm here.

26
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:47,800
understand? Okay. So, I'm here.
 

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:01:05,910
understand? Okay. So, I'm here.
Boom. Technique done.

28
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920

 

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,990

Just want you to free your mind. Stop

30
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
Just want you to free your mind. Stop
 

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,149
Just want you to free your mind. Stop
traveling all over the mat.

32
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
traveling all over the mat.
 

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,670
traveling all over the mat.
Okay. Same thing here. I'm not moving

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
Okay. Same thing here. I'm not moving
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,350
Okay. Same thing here. I'm not moving
way out here. I just need Go

36
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
way out here. I just need Go
 

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,070
way out here. I just need Go
back. I just need that flanking angle to

38
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
back. I just need that flanking angle to
 

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,550
back. I just need that flanking angle to
him. Okay, that's all I'm looking for.

40
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
him. Okay, that's all I'm looking for.
 

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:42,830
him. Okay, that's all I'm looking for.
Boom.

42
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840

 

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,990

Done. Next thing though, it's got to be

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
Done. Next thing though, it's got to be
 

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,389
Done. Next thing though, it's got to be
the same. Okay. So, a lot of you are

46
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:49,399
the same. Okay. So, a lot of you are
 

47
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,230
the same. Okay. So, a lot of you are
here and you're pushing and he goes to

48
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
here and you're pushing and he goes to
 

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,069
here and you're pushing and he goes to
lay down and you go for it. No, he has

50
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
lay down and you go for it. No, he has
 

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,510
lay down and you go for it. No, he has
to come around me. He He doesn't get to

52
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
to come around me. He He doesn't get to
 

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,749
to come around me. He He doesn't get to
go where he wants to go. Not

54
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:06,759
go where he wants to go. Not
 

55
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,389
go where he wants to go. Not
there. Okay. Make sense?

56
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
there. Okay. Make sense?
 

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,990
there. Okay. Make sense?
And then I still have the timing issues.

58
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
And then I still have the timing issues.
 

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,830
And then I still have the timing issues.
So,

60
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:14,840
So,
 

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,270
So,
his head has to keep moving the entire

62
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
his head has to keep moving the entire
 

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,150
his head has to keep moving the entire
time, which has nothing to do with

64
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,160
time, which has nothing to do with
 

65
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,790
time, which has nothing to do with
speed.

66
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
speed.
 

67
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,630
speed.
Okay. All right. So, the mic was muted

68
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
Okay. All right. So, the mic was muted
 

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,510
Okay. All right. So, the mic was muted
on the following clip. Uh, this is what

70
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
on the following clip. Uh, this is what
 

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,270
on the following clip. Uh, this is what
I was saying. Okay.

72
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
I was saying. Okay.
 

73
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,070
I was saying. Okay.
Uh, when we come

74
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,080
Uh, when we come
 

75
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,470
Uh, when we come
around

76
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
around
 

77
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,470
around
here, a lot of times the UK, especially

78
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
here, a lot of times the UK, especially
 

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,630
here, a lot of times the UK, especially
the Federite UK, they just want to lay

80
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
the Federite UK, they just want to lay
 

81
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,750
the Federite UK, they just want to lay
down.

82
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
down.
 

83
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,309
down.
and then you take

84
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,319

 

85
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,390

it. We don't want that.

86
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
it. We don't want that.
 

87
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,030
it. We don't want that.
Okay. He h I have to from the new

88
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
Okay. He h I have to from the new
 

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,430
Okay. He h I have to from the new
control

90
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,440
control
 

91
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,589
control
point make his center traverse the

92
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
point make his center traverse the
 

93
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,589
point make his center traverse the
sagittal plane. So when I just do this

94
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
sagittal plane. So when I just do this
 

95
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,990
sagittal plane. So when I just do this
when I'm just in this shoulder joint,

96
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
when I'm just in this shoulder joint,
 

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,149
when I'm just in this shoulder joint,
you could see his center doesn't really

98
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
you could see his center doesn't really
 

99
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,350
you could see his center doesn't really
traverse the mat. Okay. So when when I'm

100
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
traverse the mat. Okay. So when when I'm
 

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,830
traverse the mat. Okay. So when when I'm
here like this, I have to make him

102
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
here like this, I have to make him
 

103
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,670
here like this, I have to make him
traverse the sagittal

104
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680

 

105
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,030

plane. Not in the shoulder. I'm still

106
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
plane. Not in the shoulder. I'm still
 

107
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,830
plane. Not in the shoulder. I'm still
working with that. He still has to come

108
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
working with that. He still has to come
 

109
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,110
working with that. He still has to come
around

110
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,120
around
 

111
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,430
around
me. I'll give you a metric to look at.

112
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
me. I'll give you a metric to look at.
 

113
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,390
me. I'll give you a metric to look at.
When you're doing this other thing, his

114
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
When you're doing this other thing, his
 

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,190
When you're doing this other thing, his
spine stays on the same vector it was

116
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
spine stays on the same vector it was
 

117
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,309
spine stays on the same vector it was
before. When you're doing it

118
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,319
before. When you're doing it
 

119
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,630
before. When you're doing it
right, his

120
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:45,640
right, his
 

121
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,670
right, his
uh vector is going to

122
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:48,680
uh vector is going to
 

123
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,309
uh vector is going to
change. Do you

124
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:51,319
change. Do you
 

125
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,589
change. Do you
see? Okay. Was there another point I was

126
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,599
see? Okay. Was there another point I was
 

127
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,429
see? Okay. Was there another point I was
making? That's pretty much it. But was

128
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
making? That's pretty much it. But was
 

129
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,350
making? That's pretty much it. But was
there any

130
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,360
there any
 

131
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,190
there any
other clues I gave? You related it I

132
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
other clues I gave? You related it I
 

133
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,030
other clues I gave? You related it I
think it was a sweat. Oh, yeah. The

134
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
think it was a sweat. Oh, yeah. The
 

135
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,589
think it was a sweat. Oh, yeah. The
wrist. Okay. So, what happens here is

136
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
wrist. Okay. So, what happens here is
 

137
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,309
wrist. Okay. So, what happens here is
you do feel the yong aspect of his

138
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
you do feel the yong aspect of his
 

139
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,350
you do feel the yong aspect of his
center, but that's what you want. You

140
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
center, but that's what you want. You
 

141
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,069
center, but that's what you want. You
don't want to go around it and leave it

142
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
don't want to go around it and leave it
 

143
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,670
don't want to go around it and leave it
there and you're just in the shoulder

144
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
there and you're just in the shoulder
 

145
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,150
there and you're just in the shoulder
here. Okay? It's very similar to when

146
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,160
here. Okay? It's very similar to when
 

147
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,469
here. Okay? It's very similar to when
people

148
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:25,479
people
 

149
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,870
people
feel, oh, can't move, and then you take

150
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
feel, oh, can't move, and then you take
 

151
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,990
feel, oh, can't move, and then you take
away this. Okay?

152
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
away this. Okay?
 

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,909
away this. Okay?
the everything is

154
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:34,919
the everything is
 

155
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,670
the everything is
moving. There's that vector change on

156
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
moving. There's that vector change on
 

157
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,749
moving. There's that vector change on
his spine. Okay. Um don't go around Yong

158
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
his spine. Okay. Um don't go around Yong
 

159
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,710
his spine. Okay. Um don't go around Yong
aspect. Internalize Yong aspect. Okay.

160
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
aspect. Internalize Yong aspect. Okay.
 

161
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,629
aspect. Internalize Yong aspect. Okay.
That's what you're using to keep control

162
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
That's what you're using to keep control
 

163
00:04:46,639 --> 00:06:15,029
That's what you're using to keep control
of him from the limb.

164
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039

 

165
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,670

This part is very

166
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680

 

167
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,070

important.

168
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,080
important.
 

169
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,790
important.
Um, so I'll repeat what I was saying.

170
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
Um, so I'll repeat what I was saying.
 

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,110
Um, so I'll repeat what I was saying.
Okay. What I am

172
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay. What I am
 

173
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,189
Okay. What I am
doing

174
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,199
doing
 

175
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,830
doing
is trying to get that center into the

176
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
is trying to get that center into the
 

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,790
is trying to get that center into the
throw that we saw Andrew take on the

178
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
throw that we saw Andrew take on the
 

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,469
throw that we saw Andrew take on the
last video. Okay. So, here's the shift

180
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
last video. Okay. So, here's the shift
 

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,790
last video. Okay. So, here's the shift
in the difference. And now I start to

182
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
in the difference. And now I start to
 

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,189
in the difference. And now I start to
blend with the energy that's going that

184
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
blend with the energy that's going that
 

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,270
blend with the energy that's going that
way in the center. Okay.

186
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280

 

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,950

The only way his center at speed of life

188
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
The only way his center at speed of life
 

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,070
The only way his center at speed of life
is not going to be projected is he

190
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
is not going to be projected is he
 

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,430
is not going to be projected is he
counters with the yin yield. Do you see

192
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,440
counters with the yin yield. Do you see
 

193
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,870
counters with the yin yield. Do you see
that? When I feel what is the yin yield

194
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
that? When I feel what is the yin yield
 

195
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,189
that? When I feel what is the yin yield
is I would be

196
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:14,199
is I would be
 

197
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,670
is I would be
displacing through a higher yong value.

198
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
displacing through a higher yong value.
 

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,469
displacing through a higher yong value.
Do you see on his body? And what I feel

200
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:21,479
Do you see on his body? And what I feel
 

201
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,270
Do you see on his body? And what I feel
energetically in the counter is my yong

202
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
energetically in the counter is my yong
 

203
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,870
energetically in the counter is my yong
value is hugely decreasing like

204
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
value is hugely decreasing like
 

205
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,230
value is hugely decreasing like
okay and when I feel that I don't keep

206
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,240
okay and when I feel that I don't keep
 

207
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,950
okay and when I feel that I don't keep
pushing on that same center I don't keep

208
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
pushing on that same center I don't keep
 

209
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,430
pushing on that same center I don't keep
doing that. Okay. This the second I feel

210
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
doing that. Okay. This the second I feel
 

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,309
doing that. Okay. This the second I feel
I'm already going for the elbow. Do do

212
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
I'm already going for the elbow. Do do
 

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,830
I'm already going for the elbow. Do do
you get it?

214
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
you get it?
 

215
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,990
you get it?
Um, and each UK is

216
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,000
Um, and each UK is
 

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,189
Um, and each UK is
different. What I tend to do with you is

218
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
different. What I tend to do with you is
 

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,629
different. What I tend to do with you is
I will project your

220
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:57,639
I will project your
 

221
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,670
I will project your
center enough to

222
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,680
center enough to
 

223
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,070
center enough to
stimulate your own intuitive hyper yin

224
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
stimulate your own intuitive hyper yin
 

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,029
stimulate your own intuitive hyper yin
yield.

226
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:06,039
yield.
 

227
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,189
yield.
Okay? And then as soon as I feel the

228
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
Okay? And then as soon as I feel the
 

229
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,950
Okay? And then as soon as I feel the
yang value, the yang equation changing

230
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
yang value, the yang equation changing
 

231
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,390
yang value, the yang equation changing
value, like as soon, do you see? Like

232
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
value, like as soon, do you see? Like
 

233
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,589
value, like as soon, do you see? Like
let's say it was at 10, you were at six.

234
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
let's say it was at 10, you were at six.
 

235
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,230
let's say it was at 10, you were at six.
I'm going to displace you. As soon as I

236
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm going to displace you. As soon as I
 

237
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,990
I'm going to displace you. As soon as I
feel mine go to 9.9, I'm done on that.

238
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
feel mine go to 9.9, I'm done on that.
 

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,150
feel mine go to 9.9, I'm done on that.
I'm not going there anymore. The elbows

240
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm not going there anymore. The elbows
 

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,869
I'm not going there anymore. The elbows
open. That's the only way that happened.

242
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
open. That's the only way that happened.
 

243
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,110
open. That's the only way that happened.
Okay, that that's what I'm doing.

244
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
Okay, that that's what I'm doing.
 

245
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,110
Okay, that that's what I'm doing.
Um I'm not trying to throw

246
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,120
Um I'm not trying to throw
 

247
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,430
Um I'm not trying to throw
him. What you guys are doing is you

248
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
him. What you guys are doing is you
 

249
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,230
him. What you guys are doing is you
either go too far and now the elbow's

250
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
either go too far and now the elbow's
 

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,269
either go too far and now the elbow's
not there to catch. Okay, you you missed

252
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
not there to catch. Okay, you you missed
 

253
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,750
not there to catch. Okay, you you missed
the window of

254
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
the window of
 

255
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,710
the window of
opportunity. Or the worst

256
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:51,720
opportunity. Or the worst
 

257
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,030
opportunity. Or the worst
mistake is that you never project his

258
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
mistake is that you never project his
 

259
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,710
mistake is that you never project his
center and you're up in his shoulder

260
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
center and you're up in his shoulder
 

261
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,190
center and you're up in his shoulder
trying to get his body into that tilt.

262
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200
trying to get his body into that tilt.
 

263
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,430
trying to get his body into that tilt.
Okay? And what the point I'm making is

264
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
Okay? And what the point I'm making is
 

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,190
Okay? And what the point I'm making is
that only works

266
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
that only works
 

267
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,350
that only works
because he is choreographing the

268
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
because he is choreographing the
 

269
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,710
because he is choreographing the
maintenance of his grip. Okay? So for

270
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
maintenance of his grip. Okay? So for
 

271
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,710
maintenance of his grip. Okay? So for
example, I'll be the uk and let's

272
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
example, I'll be the uk and let's
 

273
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,630
example, I'll be the uk and let's
demonstrate. It's in my shoulder. You

274
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,640
demonstrate. It's in my shoulder. You
 

275
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,630
demonstrate. It's in my shoulder. You
see? Okay. If you pay

276
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:27,640
see? Okay. If you pay
 

277
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,829
see? Okay. If you pay
attention, we'll watch it again. And

278
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
attention, we'll watch it again. And
 

279
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,389
attention, we'll watch it again. And
you're going to watch my spine upright.

280
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
you're going to watch my spine upright.
 

281
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,470
you're going to watch my spine upright.
Upright. And now it starts to

282
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,480
Upright. And now it starts to
 

283
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,829
Upright. And now it starts to
go. He goes

284
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:38,839
go. He goes
 

285
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,670
go. He goes
upright. I felt his yong. Why don't I

286
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
upright. I felt his yong. Why don't I
 

287
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,190
upright. I felt his yong. Why don't I
just let go? Do do you

288
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,200
just let go? Do do you
 

289
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,389
just let go? Do do you
understand on the other one? Boom. Is

290
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
understand on the other one? Boom. Is
 

291
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,190
understand on the other one? Boom. Is
that's there. Okay. He did the spinal

292
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
that's there. Okay. He did the spinal
 

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,910
that's there. Okay. He did the spinal
displacement and I attack on the spinal

294
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
displacement and I attack on the spinal
 

295
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,790
displacement and I attack on the spinal
displacement. Do you see? And once the

296
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
displacement. Do you see? And once the
 

297
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,590
displacement. Do you see? And once the
energy is going that way, I keep the

298
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
energy is going that way, I keep the
 

299
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,990
energy is going that way, I keep the
inertia brings here and pull. I'm doing

300
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
inertia brings here and pull. I'm doing
 

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,630
inertia brings here and pull. I'm doing
that.

302
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
that.
 

303
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,750
that.
Okay. So, we're

304
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:08,760
Okay. So, we're
 

305
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,190
Okay. So, we're
like here, let's say.

306
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,200
like here, let's say.
 

307
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,670
like here, let's say.
Okay. And uh you're going to let

308
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
Okay. And uh you're going to let
 

309
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay. And uh you're going to let
go when I uh do the projection. Do you

310
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
go when I uh do the projection. Do you
 

311
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:31,790
go when I uh do the projection. Do you
understand?

312
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:31,800

 

313
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,790

Good. But you still saw it.

314
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:35,800
Good. But you still saw it.
 

315
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,990
Good. But you still saw it.
Okay.

316
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,000

 

317
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,550

Good. Good.

318
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
Good. Good.
 

319
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,470
Good. Good.
Okay. So, now we go in

320
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:47,480
Okay. So, now we go in
 

321
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,350
Okay. So, now we go in
motion. Not Not so good anymore. Do Do

322
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
motion. Not Not so good anymore. Do Do
 

323
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,509
motion. Not Not so good anymore. Do Do
you get

324
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:52,519
you get
 

325
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,829
you get
it? Why? Why would you say just

326
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:56,839
it? Why? Why would you say just
 

327
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,910
it? Why? Why would you say just
intuitively what

328
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:58,920
intuitively what
 

329
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,389
intuitively what
happened? Why did it work after after a

330
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
happened? Why did it work after after a
 

331
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,030
happened? Why did it work after after a
few reps? Why did it

332
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,040
few reps? Why did it
 

333
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,470
few reps? Why did it
work when I'm there? And why did it not

334
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
work when I'm there? And why did it not
 

335
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:21,190
work when I'm there? And why did it not
work this last?

336
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200

 

337
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,949

Yeah. Do you guys got it? So the

338
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:23,959
Yeah. Do you guys got it? So the
 

339
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,350
Yeah. Do you guys got it? So the
the basically the reactionary window is

340
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
the basically the reactionary window is
 

341
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,069
the basically the reactionary window is
way too it's way too freaking small.

342
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
way too it's way too freaking small.
 

343
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,150
way too it's way too freaking small.
Okay. I might not get EO I might not get

344
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
Okay. I might not get EO I might not get
 

345
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,470
Okay. I might not get EO I might not get
a full throw, but you're definitely not

346
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
a full throw, but you're definitely not
 

347
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,269
a full throw, but you're definitely not
going to be standing there looking at me

348
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
going to be standing there looking at me
 

349
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,829
going to be standing there looking at me
as if I was in the shoulder. Do do you

350
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
as if I was in the shoulder. Do do you
 

351
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,990
as if I was in the shoulder. Do do you
understand? And I would say I still did

352
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
understand? And I would say I still did
 

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,190
understand? And I would say I still did
that pretty slow right on the on the

354
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
that pretty slow right on the on the
 

355
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,509
that pretty slow right on the on the
throw part. It just was continuous as it

356
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
throw part. It just was continuous as it
 

357
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,269
throw part. It just was continuous as it
was going. Okay.

358
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:52,279
was going. Okay.
 

359
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,550
was going. Okay.
So he could let go and he did, but it

360
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
So he could let go and he did, but it
 

361
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,350
So he could let go and he did, but it
wasn't enough to stop the projection. Do

362
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
wasn't enough to stop the projection. Do
 

363
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,190
wasn't enough to stop the projection. Do
do you get it? In the other one, he was

364
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
do you get it? In the other one, he was
 

365
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,230
do you get it? In the other one, he was
upright the whole time until I got into

366
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
upright the whole time until I got into
 

367
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,069
upright the whole time until I got into
the shoulder and then pushed his head.

368
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
the shoulder and then pushed his head.
 

369
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,310
the shoulder and then pushed his head.
Well, what if he lets go in all that

370
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:15,320
Well, what if he lets go in all that
 

371
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,829
Well, what if he lets go in all that
until that you just have a guy that's

372
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
until that you just have a guy that's
 

373
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,990
until that you just have a guy that's
standing there? Okay, does that make

374
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
standing there? Okay, does that make
 

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,389
standing there? Okay, does that make
sense?

376
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:21,399
sense?
 

377
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,509
sense?
So careful. You you should be in this

378
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
So careful. You you should be in this
 

379
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,710
So careful. You you should be in this
technique. The way to do it as a nag is

380
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
technique. The way to do it as a nag is
 

381
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,629
technique. The way to do it as a nag is
that you feel you feel that. Do you get

382
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
that you feel you feel that. Do you get
 

383
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,670
that you feel you feel that. Do you get
it? You don't try to do

384
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:36,680
it? You don't try to do
 

385
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,430
it? You don't try to do
eil. Got it? You're like, I'm trying to

386
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
eil. Got it? You're like, I'm trying to
 

387
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,069
eil. Got it? You're like, I'm trying to
get his arm so I can get his elbow. You

388
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
get his arm so I can get his elbow. You
 

389
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,110
get his arm so I can get his elbow. You
don't try to do that. You feel the

390
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,120
don't try to do that. You feel the
 

391
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,509
don't try to do that. You feel the
energy. You'll feel the leakage. and the

392
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
energy. You'll feel the leakage. and the
 

393
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,990
energy. You'll feel the leakage. and the
elbow will be there. So instead of

394
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
elbow will be there. So instead of
 

395
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,350
elbow will be there. So instead of
training as I say architecturally like

396
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
training as I say architecturally like
 

397
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,590
training as I say architecturally like
an architect drew these blueprints on a

398
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
an architect drew these blueprints on a
 

399
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,670
an architect drew these blueprints on a
piece of paper, you're training

400
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
piece of paper, you're training
 

401
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,150
piece of paper, you're training
uh not in that kind of intellectual

402
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
uh not in that kind of intellectual
 

403
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,310
uh not in that kind of intellectual
capacity, but you're training in terms

404
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
capacity, but you're training in terms
 

405
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,470
capacity, but you're training in terms
of feeling the energy and experiencing

406
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
of feeling the energy and experiencing
 

407
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,389
of feeling the energy and experiencing
the energy. Okay? And you have to be

408
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:13,399
the energy. Okay? And you have to be
 

409
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,790
the energy. Okay? And you have to be
careful when I know you didn't push that

410
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
careful when I know you didn't push that
 

411
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,470
careful when I know you didn't push that

the mat and you're just in the shoulder

414
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
the mat and you're just in the shoulder
 

415
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,069
the mat and you're just in the shoulder
and you're unaware that he's only

416
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
and you're unaware that he's only
 

417
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,629
and you're unaware that he's only
holding on because of culture and not

418
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:27,639
holding on because of culture and not
 

419
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,790
holding on because of culture and not
because he has no time to not to. And

420
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
because he has no time to not to. And
 

421
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,590
because he has no time to not to. And
the best thing to do is to try to just

422
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
the best thing to do is to try to just
 

423
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,829
the best thing to do is to try to just
do that. Okay, got it. So pay attention.

424
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
do that. Okay, got it. So pay attention.
 

425
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
do that. Okay, got it. So pay attention.
