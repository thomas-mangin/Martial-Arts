absorbing so that was one question the

20
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,880
absorbing so that was one question the
 

21
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,230
absorbing so that was one question the
next question go

22
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
next question go
 

23
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,790
next question go

00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:37,079
because he's just blending with
 

29
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,830
because he's just blending with
me so there lies the question he's

30
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
me so there lies the question he's
 

31
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,590
me so there lies the question he's
blending with

32
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:42,600
blending with
 

33
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,470

so the question was I felt I felt

40

41
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,149
so the question was I felt I felt
