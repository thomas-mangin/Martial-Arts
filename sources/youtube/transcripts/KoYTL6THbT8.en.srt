that anyone learns an art and then you

12
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
that anyone learns an art and then you
 

13
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,390
that anyone learns an art and then you
study some art I think that's a

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
study some art I think that's a
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,189
study some art I think that's a
very academic point of view and when I

16
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
very academic point of view and when I
 

17
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,509
very academic point of view and when I
say academic I mean it's not truthful

18
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
say academic I mean it's not truthful
 

19
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,910
say academic I mean it's not truthful
it's not it's not accurate it's it's

20
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
it's not it's not accurate it's it's
 

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,830
it's not it's not accurate it's it's
made it's a point of view made for the

22
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
made it's a point of view made for the
 

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,630
made it's a point of view made for the
production of a discourse

24
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
production of a discourse
 

25
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,870
production of a discourse
and then that discourse goes on to serve

26
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
and then that discourse goes on to serve
 

27
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,069
and then that discourse goes on to serve
something so for example the idea as as

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,990
to know what ensei studied uh and then
they're picturing that you know he

with this kind of Harmony of the two or

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
with this kind of Harmony of the two or
 

51
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,469
with this kind of Harmony of the two or
some equal measure of the two that's not

what we

what we
do the ego tripartite mind goes around

56
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,680
do the ego tripartite mind goes around
 

57
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,550
do the ego tripartite mind goes around
and it structures

58
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
and it structures
 

59
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,230
and it structures
everything it it it takes

60
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
everything it it it takes
 

61
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,590
everything it it it takes
Parts it recognizes them as Parts but in

62
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
Parts it recognizes them as Parts but in
 

63
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,069
Parts it recognizes them as Parts but in
its recognition of Parts it takes other

64
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,079
its recognition of Parts it takes other
 

65
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,870
its recognition of Parts it takes other
aspects and makes holes okay

66
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
aspects and makes holes okay
 

67
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,870
aspects and makes holes okay
and those parts and those holes come to

68
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
and those parts and those holes come to
 

69
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,870
and those parts and those holes come to
uh construct our identity and so as you

70
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:37,880
uh construct our identity and so as you
 

71
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,069
uh construct our identity and so as you
study

72
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:39,079
study
 

73
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,069
study
something and you study multiple things

74
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
something and you study multiple things
 

75
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,709
something and you study multiple things
and you have multiple experiences there

76
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:44,719
and you have multiple experiences there
 

77
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,350
and you have multiple experiences there
are this radical process of parts and

78
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
are this radical process of parts and
 

79
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,709
are this radical process of parts and
holes being made that come to make up

80
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:51,719
holes being made that come to make up
 

81
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,469
holes being made that come to make up
you and when you get to the holes that

82
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:55,479
you and when you get to the holes that
 

83
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,550
you and when you get to the holes that
are

84
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,560
are
 

85
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,870
are
you there there's no distinguishable

86
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
you there there's no distinguishable
 

87
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,109
you there there's no distinguishable
Parts in

88
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,119
Parts in
 

89
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,029
Parts in
them so if someone says to me today are

90
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039
them so if someone says to me today are
 

91
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,630
them so if someone says to me today are
you doing

92
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:07,640
you doing
 

93

all I've been
 

107
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,710
all I've been
making okay uh because it's just

108
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:31,720
making okay uh because it's just
 

109
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,390
making okay uh because it's just
me it's just

110
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
me it's just
 

111
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,190
me it's just
me everything that I do gets filtered

112
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
me everything that I do gets filtered
 

113
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,910
me everything that I do gets filtered
through the me through the ego

114
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920
through the me through the ego
 

115
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,509
through the me through the ego
tripartite mind everything gets filtered

116
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
tripartite mind everything gets filtered
 

117
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,990
tripartite mind everything gets filtered
through

118
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,000

 

119
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,190

there what I do is me it's my

120
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
there what I do is me it's my
 

121
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,790
there what I do is me it's my
art what my mind calls it calls it Kempo

122
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
art what my mind calls it calls it Kempo
 

123
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,830
art what my mind calls it calls it Kempo
calls it AO but I know that's all

124
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:56,840
calls it AO but I know that's all
 

125
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,149
calls it AO but I know that's all
delusion so I don't care what you call

126
00:02:59,149 --> 00:02:59,159
delusion so I don't care what you call
 

127
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,910
delusion so I don't care what you call
it

128
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:02,920

 

129
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,350

this all gets compounded by the fact

130
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
this all gets compounded by the fact
 

131
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,550
this all gets compounded by the fact
that I know the ego tripartite mind is

132
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
that I know the ego tripartite mind is
 

133
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,229
that I know the ego tripartite mind is
not the whole of me there is another

134
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
not the whole of me there is another
 

135
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,830
not the whole of me there is another
aspect of me that transcends that mind

136
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:12,840
aspect of me that transcends that mind
 

137
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,190
aspect of me that transcends that mind
and therefore there is another aspect of

138
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
and therefore there is another aspect of
 

139
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,149
and therefore there is another aspect of
me that transcends both Kempo and iido

140
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:19,159
me that transcends both Kempo and iido
 

141
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,190
me that transcends both Kempo and iido
both the division both the communion

142
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
both the division both the communion
 

143
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,350
both the division both the communion
that so it doesn't matter at

144
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
that so it doesn't matter at
 

145
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,670
that so it doesn't matter at
all what you call

146
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
all what you call
 

147
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,390
all what you call
it it is both me and not

148
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400

 

149
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,229

me I'm both being described correctly

150
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:37,239
me I'm both being described correctly
 

151
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,509
me I'm both being described correctly
but also

152
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:40,519

 

153
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,630

incorrectly so taking that and coming a

154
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
incorrectly so taking that and coming a
 

155
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,070
incorrectly so taking that and coming a
little bit more down to earth I would

156
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
little bit more down to earth I would
 

157
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,509
little bit more down to earth I would
like to use a dichotomy that Mr Parker

158
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
like to use a dichotomy that Mr Parker
 

159
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,670
like to use a dichotomy that Mr Parker
used so I trained with Mr Parker he had

160
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
used so I trained with Mr Parker he had
 

161
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,910
used so I trained with Mr Parker he had
a huge influence on how I think about

162
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:00,920
a huge influence on how I think about
 

163
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,630
a huge influence on how I think about
a martial art

164
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:03,640
a martial art
 

165
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,030
a martial art
fighting which is the the Kinesiology of

166
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
fighting which is the the Kinesiology of
 

167
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,750
fighting which is the the Kinesiology of

333
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,629
soncho why I do that move like this and
not that move like that

334
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:27,639
not that move like that
 

335
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,070
not that move like that
okay um and I'll give you a a quick

336
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
okay um and I'll give you a a quick
 

337
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,550
okay um and I'll give you a a quick
example of how I changed Sono one part

338
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
example of how I changed Sono one part
 

339
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,790
example of how I changed Sono one part
one and how I saw people

340
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
one and how I saw people
 

341
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,350
one and how I saw people
struggling falsely

342
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
struggling falsely
 

343
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,350
struggling falsely
unnecessarily because they would not

344
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,360
unnecessarily because they would not
 

345
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,990
unnecessarily because they would not
free themselves from style and just move

346
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
free themselves from style and just move
 

347
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,590
free themselves from style and just move
into kinesiological soundness okay and

348
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
into kinesiological soundness okay and
 

349
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,829
into kinesiological soundness okay and
so because I have my form is different

350
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:56,839
so because I have my form is different
 

351
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,269
so because I have my form is different
not not just in its execution but even

352
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
not not just in its execution but even
 

353
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,110
not not just in its execution but even
in in its architecture from just one

354
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,120
in in its architecture from just one
 

355
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,030
in in its architecture from just one
generation above chibba sensei's form so

356
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
generation above chibba sensei's form so
 

357
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,230
generation above chibba sensei's form so
I'll show that now okay Sano one one uh

358
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,240
I'll show that now okay Sano one one uh
 

359
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,150
I'll show that now okay Sano one one uh
it begins with a ski so he

360
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
it begins with a ski so he
 

361
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,630
it begins with a ski so he
skis good okay and we change this SC

362
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:15,640
skis good okay and we change this SC
 

363
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,389
skis good okay and we change this SC
there you go all right that's where he

364
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,399
there you go all right that's where he
 

365
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,670
there you go all right that's where he
is and that's his mind and in the form

366
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
is and that's his mind and in the form
 

367
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,269
is and that's his mind and in the form
as it was originally shown and is still

368
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:24,279
as it was originally shown and is still
 

369
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,590
as it was originally shown and is still
done this way by a lot of people uh you

370
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
done this way by a lot of people uh you
 

371
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,269
done this way by a lot of people uh you
would do your normal K that gu which is

372
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:30,279
would do your normal K that gu which is
 

373
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,110
would do your normal K that gu which is
a three-step process so I would take my

374
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
a three-step process so I would take my
 

375
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,990
a three-step process so I would take my
left foot and I would take my right foot

376
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
left foot and I would take my right foot
 

377
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,110
left foot and I would take my right foot
get the angle and then finish with that

378
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
get the angle and then finish with that
 

379
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,870
get the angle and then finish with that
ten Con on the

380
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
ten Con on the
 

381
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,949
ten Con on the
angle it would looks something like

382
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:45,959

 

383
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:55,110

this and it all looks

384
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120

 

385
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,190

fine I so people do it over and over and

386
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
fine I so people do it over and over and
 

387
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,190
fine I so people do it over and over and
over okay

388
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,200
over okay
 

389
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,949
over okay
but if we look at

390
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:01,959
but if we look at
 

391
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,990
but if we look at
it and he has the right M which is there

392
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,000
it and he has the right M which is there
 

393
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,910
it and he has the right M which is there
he has full penetration of my torso okay

394
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:10,920
he has full penetration of my torso okay
 

395
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,190
he has full penetration of my torso okay
and then I take that step off the line

396
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,200
and then I take that step off the line
 

397
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,110
and then I take that step off the line
going forward or at least to the

398
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
going forward or at least to the
 

399
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,269
going forward or at least to the
90 and then I now take the other foot

400
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:20,279
90 and then I now take the other foot
 

401
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,470
90 and then I now take the other foot
and I'm moving the

402
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
and I'm moving the
 

403
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,910
and I'm moving the
K and now i t

404
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
K and now i t
 

405
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,870
K and now i t
con and now somehow I end up over here

406
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
con and now somehow I end up over here
 

407
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,590
con and now somehow I end up over here
okay so this is clearly not the right

408
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:32,600
okay so this is clearly not the right
 

409
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,350
okay so this is clearly not the right
mind and people start doing some weird

410
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
mind and people start doing some weird
 

411
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,430
mind and people start doing some weird
things to make that work or look to work

412
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:38,440
things to make that work or look to work
 

413
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,430
things to make that work or look to work
when it didn't work one of the most

414
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
when it didn't work one of the most
 

415
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,110
when it didn't work one of the most
common things is that you don't actually

416
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
common things is that you don't actually
 

417
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,190
common things is that you don't actually
ski with the right

418
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
ski with the right
 

419
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,389
ski with the right
penetration he was never going to hit me

420
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
penetration he was never going to hit me
 

421
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,790
penetration he was never going to hit me
anyways and now I could do that and you

422
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,800
anyways and now I could do that and you
 

423
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,269
anyways and now I could do that and you
can see I'm getting a little in the area

424
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:54,279
can see I'm getting a little in the area
 

425
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,629
can see I'm getting a little in the area
okay or I combine this under penetration

426
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:57,639
okay or I combine this under penetration
 

427
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,790
okay or I combine this under penetration
where he would never hit me

428
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
where he would never hit me
 

429
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,949
where he would never hit me
with a step that goes out this way you

430
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:03,959
with a step that goes out this way you
 

431
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,949
with a step that goes out this way you
see and exposing all of this area and

432
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
see and exposing all of this area and
 

433
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,670
see and exposing all of this area and
being very twisted if I didn't expose

434
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
being very twisted if I didn't expose
 

435
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,150
being very twisted if I didn't expose
it and then I come out and now I got in

436
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,160
it and then I come out and now I got in
 

437
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,389
it and then I come out and now I got in
the right area

438
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
the right area
 

439
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,590
the right area
okay but this makes no sense he goes

440
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:20,600
okay but this makes no sense he goes
 

441
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,150
okay but this makes no sense he goes
again to give my flank to him that's not

442
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
again to give my flank to him that's not
 

443
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,470
again to give my flank to him that's not
in a weapon fighting system now I would

444
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:29,480
in a weapon fighting system now I would
 

445
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,629
in a weapon fighting system now I would
never do that and you could go to your

446
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:32,639
never do that and you could go to your
 

447
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,550
never do that and you could go to your
to your Firearms he goes and I wouldn't

448
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
to your Firearms he goes and I wouldn't
 

449
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,829
to your Firearms he goes and I wouldn't
go like that this is a very difficult

450
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
go like that this is a very difficult
 

451
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,470
go like that this is a very difficult
shot to make no one would ever do

452
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,480
shot to make no one would ever do
 

453
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,670
shot to make no one would ever do
that I would keep my gun point it at him

454
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
that I would keep my gun point it at him
 

455
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,310
that I would keep my gun point it at him
pointed at him

456
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
pointed at him
 

457
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,910
pointed at him
okay even if I had to do that weird

458
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:52,920
okay even if I had to do that weird
 

459
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,910
okay even if I had to do that weird
twist there all right so eventually in

460
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,920
twist there all right so eventually in
 

461
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,310
twist there all right so eventually in
the K Class People realize this is all

462
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
the K Class People realize this is all
 

463
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,990
the K Class People realize this is all
kind of weird especially when cha and

464
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,000
kind of weird especially when cha and
 

465
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,750
kind of weird especially when cha and
they started having us uh do a double

466
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
they started having us uh do a double
 

467
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,030
they started having us uh do a double
ski a double ski attack boom and okay

468
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
ski a double ski attack boom and okay
 

469
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,949
ski a double ski attack boom and okay
that reveals something that I knew from

470
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:13,959
that reveals something that I knew from
 

471
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,509
that reveals something that I knew from
the sidelines as I was being told to do

472
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:16,519
the sidelines as I was being told to do
 

473
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,189
the sidelines as I was being told to do
this weird

474
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:18,199
this weird
 

475
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,990
this weird
step that I had three steps to his one

476
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
step that I had three steps to his one
 

477
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,030
step that I had three steps to his one
step and that never works in weapons

478
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,040
step and that never works in weapons
 

479
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,670
step and that never works in weapons
fighting so again he goes one step and I

480
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
fighting so again he goes one step and I
 

481
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,550
fighting so again he goes one step and I
was going to go one two three and that

482
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
was going to go one two three and that
 

483
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,069
was going to go one two three and that
just never works in weapons fighting and

484
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:33,079
just never works in weapons fighting and
 

485
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,069
just never works in weapons fighting and
the double ski reveals it he goes one

486
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
the double ski reveals it he goes one
 

487

489
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,069

time so what people did eventually in

490
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
time so what people did eventually in
 

491
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,150

San Diego was and like it's so weird
 

493
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,269

that you can't do it

494
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
that you can't do it
 

495
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,030
that you can't do it
okay is they did a little baby

496
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040

 

497
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,590

step this

498
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
step this
 

499
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,350
step this
thing oh good here one

500
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,360
thing oh good here one
 

501
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,670
thing oh good here one
two one

502
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680

 

503
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:18,189

two it makes for all this tension in the

504
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:18,199

 

505
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,750

body and it seemed like well I know I

506
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
body and it seemed like well I know I
 

507
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,829
body and it seemed like well I know I
got to have my right foot forward and my

508
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
got to have my right foot forward and my
 

509
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,030
got to have my right foot forward and my
right hand

510
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
right hand
 

511
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,470
right hand
forward and that that's what they were

512
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
forward and that that's what they were
 

513
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,670
forward and that that's what they were
doing

514
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680

 

515
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,829

but I'm not sure it helps the double

516
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:42,839

 

517
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,350

ski and that's why we went okay the four

518
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,360
ski and that's why we went okay the four
 

519
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,269
ski and that's why we went okay the four
wants my right foot forward my right

520
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,279
wants my right foot forward my right
 

521
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,990
wants my right foot forward my right
hand forward and that's why we

522
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,000
hand forward and that's why we
 

523
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,430
hand forward and that's why we
went with the sheto

524
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:54,440
went with the sheto
 

525
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,189
went with the sheto
tank and when you add his true

526
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
tank and when you add his true
 

527
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,310
tank and when you add his true
penetration

528
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,320

 

529
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,829

then the technique Works see

530
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
then the technique Works see
 

531
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,749
then the technique Works see
there whereas the other little baby

532
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:08,759
there whereas the other little baby
 

533
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,430
there whereas the other little baby
steps it works a little better but not

534
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
steps it works a little better but not
 

535
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,829
steps it works a little better but not
really I'm all jammed up and I'm open to

536
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
really I'm all jammed up and I'm open to
 

537
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,509
really I'm all jammed up and I'm open to
the Double C Okay C it's right

538
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:20,519
the Double C Okay C it's right
 

539
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,150
the Double C Okay C it's right
here is also why in our

540
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
here is also why in our
 

541
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,509
here is also why in our
form I don't block I don't block I don't

542
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
form I don't block I don't block I don't
 

543
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,269
form I don't block I don't block I don't
have to block because I'm not clearing

544
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
have to block because I'm not clearing
 

545
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,350
have to block because I'm not clearing
the

546
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
the
 

547
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,710
the
line inside the weapon Arc this is the

548
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
line inside the weapon Arc this is the
 

549
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,310
line inside the weapon Arc this is the
weapon Arc I'm not ever clearing the

550
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
weapon Arc I'm not ever clearing the
 

551
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,230

553
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,749
line inside the weapon
Arc do it

554
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:46,759
Arc do it
 

555
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,749
Arc do it
again or inside the radius I'm inside

556
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:50,759
again or inside the radius I'm inside
 

557
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,590
again or inside the radius I'm inside
the radius so I need some deflection so

558
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
the radius so I need some deflection so
 

559
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,310
the radius so I need some deflection so
he doesn't follow

560
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:57,320

 

561
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,949

me even on the other another

562
00:14:59,949 --> 00:14:59,959
me even on the other another
 

563
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,749
me even on the other another
one if he does true

564
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:02,759
one if he does true
 

565
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,990
one if he does true
penetration on inside the radius I need

566
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,000
penetration on inside the radius I need
 

567
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,910
penetration on inside the radius I need
something keeping it to the left as I

568
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:08,920
something keeping it to the left as I
 

569
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,350
something keeping it to the left as I
move to the

570
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
move to the
 

571
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,189
move to the
right on the ushido

572
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:14,199
right on the ushido
 

573
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,550
right on the ushido
Tenon true penetration I've got inside

574
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:17,560
Tenon true penetration I've got inside
 

575
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,269
Tenon true penetration I've got inside
the radius so I don't have to block

576
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
the radius so I don't have to block
 

577
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,590
the radius so I don't have to block
which is why when we go embryonic I'll

578
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
which is why when we go embryonic I'll
 

579
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,230
which is why when we go embryonic I'll
touch and hit

580
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,240
touch and hit
 

581
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,350
touch and hit
but when we go for real I'm hitting him

582
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,360
but when we go for real I'm hitting him
 

583
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,389
but when we go for real I'm hitting him
as he's hitting me okay and it's just a

584
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
as he's hitting me okay and it's just a
 

585
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,110
as he's hitting me okay and it's just a
defensive path of action it's not an

586
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
defensive path of action it's not an
 

587
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,670
defensive path of action it's not an
angle of deflection okay and now it

588
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:42,680
angle of deflection okay and now it
 

589
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,150
angle of deflection okay and now it
makes more sense you did one step I did

590
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,160
makes more sense you did one step I did
 

591
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,749
makes more sense you did one step I did
one step I hit you as you hit me that's

592
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
one step I hit you as you hit me that's
 

593
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,389
one step I hit you as you hit me that's
Marshall okay me doing three steps you

594
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,399
Marshall okay me doing three steps you
 

595
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,189
Marshall okay me doing three steps you
doing one step you not throwing anything

596
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:54,199
doing one step you not throwing anything
 

597
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,990
doing one step you not throwing anything
and waiting for me to finish those two

598
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
and waiting for me to finish those two
 

599
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,389
and waiting for me to finish those two
steps that's not Marshall that's sty

600
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
steps that's not Marshall that's sty
 

601
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,309
steps that's not Marshall that's sty
okay so we're going to look

602
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:03,319
okay so we're going to look
 

603
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,470
okay so we're going to look
at the

604
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:05,480
at the
 

605
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,110
at the
particulars from or the particulars of

particulars from or the particulars of
 

607
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,150
particulars from or the particulars of
the footwork and the hip angle and all

608
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
the footwork and the hip angle and all
 

609
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,910
the footwork and the hip angle and all
this kind of stuff to get rid of what I

610
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:12,920
this kind of stuff to get rid of what I
 

611
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,749
this kind of stuff to get rid of what I
to me always looks weird when IO people

612
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:16,759
to me always looks weird when IO people
 

613
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,910
to me always looks weird when IO people
are standing in what is clearly

614
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
are standing in what is clearly
 

615
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,069
are standing in what is clearly

620
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,399
kinesiological sound ways okay
 

621
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,110
kinesiological sound ways okay
okay so um stand in the beginning okay

622
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,120
okay so um stand in the beginning okay
 

623
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,030
okay so um stand in the beginning okay
cool stay there all

624
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040

 

625
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,790

right so Sean's been with me for a while

but he has lots of ferite iido in him

628
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:45,560
but he has lots of ferite iido in him
 

629
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,550
but he has lots of ferite iido in him
and this is

631
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,550

similar in that you don't have your dck

he he's not standing like this okay but
 

637
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,910
he he's not standing like this okay but
is still different enough

638
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
is still different enough
 

639
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,069
is still different enough
okay um Taylor what do you what can you

different um the back heel isn't up on
 

645
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,150
different um the back heel isn't up on
the rear on the rear foot okay so the

646
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
the rear on the rear foot okay so the
 

647
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,750
the rear on the rear foot okay so the
weight is uh kind of like

648
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
weight is uh kind of like
 

649
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,309
weight is uh kind of like
um it's not a very doesn't look like a

650
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
um it's not a very doesn't look like a
 

651
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,909
um it's not a very doesn't look like a
very athletic or

mobile stance from that point and so

654
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
mobile stance from that point and so
 

655
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,909
mobile stance from that point and so
often times when we begin the form like

656
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:26,919
often times when we begin the form like

692
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:21,880
bracing okay and so
 

693
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,390

this

696
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
this
 

697
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,590
this
case but not here because then it's

698
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,600
case but not here because then it's
 

699
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,750

going to be bracing yours is back more

700
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
going to be bracing yours is back more
 

701
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,750
going to be bracing yours is back more
so if you

702
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:36,760
so if you
 

703
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,990
so if you
look and you pick this arm up you have

704
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,000
look and you pick this arm up you have
 

705
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,470
look and you pick this arm up you have
this line This diagonal line and I would

706
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
this line This diagonal line and I would
 

707
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,789
this line This diagonal line and I would
like to see it straight on the midfoot

708
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:47,799
like to see it straight on the midfoot
 

709
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,870
like to see it straight on the midfoot
so you would have to bring this foot

710
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:49,880
so you would have to bring this foot
 

711
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,710
so you would have to bring this foot
in okay and that's going to make your

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,389
so very common
thing is you'll see the Deep stance

988
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:49,399
thing is you'll see the Deep stance
 

989
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,870
thing is you'll see the Deep stance
again okay and now as you're as you're

990
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
again okay and now as you're as you're
 

991
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,149
again okay and now as you're as you're
doing this you've made things worse

992
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:57,159
doing this you've made things worse
 

993
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:01,430
doing this you've made things worse
because weights out here weights out

994
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
because weights out here weights out
 

995
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,630
because weights out here weights out
here weights here where my butt is

996
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:05,640
here weights here where my butt is
 

997
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,669
here weights here where my butt is
whereas if my feet were closer the

998
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:08,679
whereas if my feet were closer the
 

999
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,630
whereas if my feet were closer the
weight's more here there's weight on my

1000
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
weight's more here there's weight on my
 

1001
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,870
weight's more here there's weight on my
feet weight on my feet weight on my butt

1002
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
feet weight on my feet weight on my butt
 

1003
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,830
feet weight on my feet weight on my butt
line and I'm closer to the Joe I'm now

1004
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
line and I'm closer to the Joe I'm now
 

1005
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,190
line and I'm closer to the Joe I'm now
spreading it out see and the Joe will

1006
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
spreading it out see and the Joe will
 

1007
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,389
spreading it out see and the Joe will
get

1008
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:20,399
get
 

1009
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,909
get
lighter boom gets lighter you see you

1010
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:24,919
lighter boom gets lighter you see you
 

1011
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,590
lighter boom gets lighter you see you
actually pick me back up okay so you see

1012
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:28,600
actually pick me back up okay so you see
 

1013
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,510
actually pick me back up okay so you see
a lot of people do this and there's no

1014
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
a lot of people do this and there's no
 

1015
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,029
a lot of people do this and there's no
real power in the weapon

1016
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:34,039
real power in the weapon
 

1017
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,549
real power in the weapon
okay so I have to stack my

1018
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:37,559
okay so I have to stack my
 

1019
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,710
okay so I have to stack my
bones and I'm going to

1020
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:39,720
bones and I'm going to
 

1021
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,149
bones and I'm going to
use H me again which is just Sheen time

1022
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:45,159
use H me again which is just Sheen time
 

1023
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:48,350
use H me again which is just Sheen time
okay so I'm going to drop

1024
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,360
okay so I'm going to drop
 

1025
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,430
okay so I'm going to drop
weight and once the weight can't drop

1026
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
weight and once the weight can't drop
 

1027
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,710
weight and once the weight can't drop
anymore over the midfoot line I bring it

1028
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:55,720
anymore over the midfoot line I bring it
 

1029
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,070
anymore over the midfoot line I bring it
over the Joe it weights on the Joe okay

1030
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
over the Joe it weights on the Joe okay
 

1031
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,190
over the Joe it weights on the Joe okay
so if you come over here get off on the

1032
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,200
so if you come over here get off on the
 

1033
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,230
so if you come over here get off on the
side I go

1034
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
side I go
 

1035
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,630
side I go
here Joe's out there or my weight's here

1036
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
here Joe's out there or my weight's here
 

1037
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,029
here Joe's out there or my weight's here
and you lift the Joe you'll feel

1038
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:14,039
and you lift the Joe you'll feel
 

1039
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,070
and you lift the Joe you'll feel
that there's no weight really on

1040
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,080
that there's no weight really on
 

1041
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,830
that there's no weight really on
it but if I were go ahead and grab it if

1042
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
it but if I were go ahead and grab it if
 

1043
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,070
it but if I were go ahead and grab it if
I'm pushing my weight over it you're

1044
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm pushing my weight over it you're
 

1045
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,230
I'm pushing my weight over it you're
going to feel my weight as you try to

1046
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,240
going to feel my weight as you try to
 

1047
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,430
going to feel my weight as you try to
lift up now I add my weight

1048
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
lift up now I add my weight
 

1049
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,070
lift up now I add my weight
dropping and you can see there's way

1050
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
dropping and you can see there's way
 

1051
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,870
dropping and you can see there's way
more weight on that thing so ground I'm

1052
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:37,880
more weight on that thing so ground I'm
 

1053
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,789
more weight on that thing so ground I'm
doing the same move and there's a lot of

1054
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
doing the same move and there's a lot of
 

1055
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,389
doing the same move and there's a lot of
weight on the

1056
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399

 

1057
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,310

weapon so a lot of people

1058
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,320
weapon so a lot of people
 

1059
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,870
weapon so a lot of people
think this is Marsh sound but it's not

1060
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:51,880
think this is Marsh sound but it's not
 

1061
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,190
think this is Marsh sound but it's not
this is

1062
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
this is
 

1063
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,310
this is
style Marley sound is

1064
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
style Marley sound is
 

1065
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,029
style Marley sound is
here okay here's where I want to be a

1066
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,039
here okay here's where I want to be a
 

1067
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,310
here okay here's where I want to be a
lot of people

1068
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,320
lot of people
 

1069
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,350
lot of people
think that you're pinned you're not

1070
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,360
think that you're pinned you're not
 

1071
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,149
think that you're pinned you're not
pinned you're not Pinn because you

1072
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
pinned you're not Pinn because you
 

1073
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,110
pinned you're not Pinn because you
really

1074
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
really
 

1075
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,630
really
haven't compromised your knee bend your

1076
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:11,640
haven't compromised your knee bend your
 

1077
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,430
haven't compromised your knee bend your
knee Bend doesn't go any further than

1078
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
knee Bend doesn't go any further than
 

1079
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,029
knee Bend doesn't go any further than
normal so as I doing the move you can

1080
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
normal so as I doing the move you can
 

1081
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,509
normal so as I doing the move you can
move you can move just as quickly okay

1082
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:23,519
move you can move just as quickly okay
 

1083
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:30,110
move you can move just as quickly okay
so we'll have you do that so you can see

1084
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,120

 

1085
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,669

just get into those different

1086
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:32,679
just get into those different
 

1087
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,149
just get into those different
positions good you're on the side so

1088
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,159
positions good you're on the side so
 

1089
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,509
positions good you're on the side so
they usually drop their butt lower they

1090
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:38,519
they usually drop their butt lower they
 

1091
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,750
they usually drop their butt lower they
think that's it and then you can see so

1092
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
think that's it and then you can see so
 

1093
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,830
think that's it and then you can see so
the resistance to the lift is how much

1094
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:46,840
the resistance to the lift is how much
 

1095
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,230
the resistance to the lift is how much
downward Force you would have in this

1096
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:49,240
downward Force you would have in this
 

1097
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,350
downward Force you would have in this
Oshi okay so we'll do that one more time

1098
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
Oshi okay so we'll do that one more time
 

1099
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,269
Oshi okay so we'll do that one more time
okay lower your butt like you got really

1100
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
okay lower your butt like you got really
 

1101
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,669
okay lower your butt like you got really
you went really low okay there's no

1102
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
you went really low okay there's no
 

1103
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,509
you went really low okay there's no
weight on it okay and that just gets

1104
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:00,519
weight on it okay and that just gets
 

1105
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,269
weight on it okay and that just gets
exponentially

1106
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:02,279
exponentially
 

1107
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,190
exponentially
worse at the distal end there's just no

1108
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
worse at the distal end there's just no
 

1109
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,389
worse at the distal end there's just no
weight on it you

1110
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
weight on it you
 

1111
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,789
weight on it you
see and now we'll have you go into find

1112
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:11,799
see and now we'll have you go into find
 

1113
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,350
see and now we'll have you go into find
chenai first cuz you're going to stack

1114
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:14,360
chenai first cuz you're going to stack
 

1115
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,029
chenai first cuz you're going to stack
the bones then find Han me you turn the

1116
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:18,039
the bones then find Han me you turn the
 

1117
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,830
the bones then find Han me you turn the
foot toward the angle there you go okay

1118
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
foot toward the angle there you go okay
 

1119
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,669
foot toward the angle there you go okay
and you

1120
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
and you
 

1121
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,149
and you
drop and what you're doing here is like

1122
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:27,159
drop and what you're doing here is like
 

1123
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,789
drop and what you're doing here is like
you're doing

1124
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
you're doing
 

1125
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,110
you're doing
your back squat feel that line that's

1126
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,120
your back squat feel that line that's
 

1127
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,830
your back squat feel that line that's
your posture the downward line there

1128
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:34,840
your posture the downward line there
 

1129
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,149
your posture the downward line there
which is the downward line of the Joe

1130
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:37,159
which is the downward line of the Joe
 

1131
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,669
which is the downward line of the Joe
okay actually turn there okay and then

1132
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
okay actually turn there okay and then
 

1133
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,750
okay actually turn there okay and then
it'll be impossible for me to lift that

1134
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
it'll be impossible for me to lift that
 

1135
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,789
it'll be impossible for me to lift that
thing up on you okay got it and again

1136
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:47,799
thing up on you okay got it and again
 

1137
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:50,350
thing up on you okay got it and again
you could see oh yeah that's way heavier

1138
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,360
you could see oh yeah that's way heavier
 

1139
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,389
you could see oh yeah that's way heavier
than the other one

1140
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
than the other one
 

1141
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,269
than the other one
okay make sense yes all right have you

1142
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:56,279
okay make sense yes all right have you
 

1143
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,590
okay make sense yes all right have you
guys play with that so here's here's

1144
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:58,600

do a Toshi and they have to step off the
 

1305
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,389
do a Toshi and they have to step off the
line This Way CH says they would have to

1306
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:53,399
line This Way CH says they would have to
 

1307
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,190
line This Way CH says they would have to
do that all the time and it's

1308
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,200
do that all the time and it's
 

1309
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,390
do that all the time and it's
because the

1310
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
because the
 

1311
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,470
because the
hip knee foot alignment is not there and

1312
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:03,480
hip knee foot alignment is not there and
 

1313
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,589
hip knee foot alignment is not there and
you start to now have horizontal forces

1314
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:06,599
you start to now have horizontal forces
 

1315
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,069
you start to now have horizontal forces
cutting across your stance okay where

1316
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:09,079
cutting across your stance okay where
 

1317
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,870
cutting across your stance okay where
you're not strong because you have kind

1318
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
you're not strong because you have kind

of adopted a tight loope stance you see
 

1321
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,470
of adopted a tight loope stance you see
because I'm now penetrating I gave a

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:19,480
because I'm now penetrating I gave a
 

1323
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,710
because I'm now penetrating I gave a
purpose to my stance and I'm going to

1324
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:21,720
purpose to my stance and I'm going to
 

1325
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,710
purpose to my stance and I'm going to
take advantage of my biomechanics for

1326
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
take advantage of my biomechanics for
 

1327
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,270
take advantage of my biomechanics for
that singular purpose in this case ad me

1328
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
that singular purpose in this case ad me
 

1329
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,829
that singular purpose in this case ad me
okay but within your Emi you're adapting

1330
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:30,839
okay but within your Emi you're adapting
 

1331
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,390
okay but within your Emi you're adapting
for the fact that your stance is narrow

1332
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,400
for the fact that your stance is narrow
 

1333
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,069
for the fact that your stance is narrow
and the way you do that is this qua

1334
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
and the way you do that is this qua
 

1335
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,710
and the way you do that is this qua
closes a little allowing the knee to

1336
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
closes a little allowing the knee to
 

1337
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,670
closes a little allowing the knee to
come and that requires the foot to be

1338
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:42,680
come and that requires the foot to be
 

1339
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,310
come and that requires the foot to be
slightly turned in there's the there's

1340
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:45,320
slightly turned in there's the there's
 

1341
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,630
slightly turned in there's the there's
no way around it so if you for example

1342
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
no way around it so if you for example
 

1343
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,230
no way around it so if you for example
turn your foot out

1344
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,240
turn your foot out
 

1345
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,430
turn your foot out
try right do you see let's even do

1346
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
try right do you see let's even do
 

1347
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,670
try right do you see let's even do
straight and you'll feel tension here

1348
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
straight and you'll feel tension here
 

1349
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,589
straight and you'll feel tension here
here do you see there's now tension

1350
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
here do you see there's now tension
 

1351
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,230
here do you see there's now tension
across the inner knee and as a result

1352
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
across the inner knee and as a result
 

1353
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,790
across the inner knee and as a result
you've had to unturn the hip and not

1354
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:05,800
you've had to unturn the hip and not
 

1355
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,190
you've had to unturn the hip and not
close the quaw and now there's no quaw

1356
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,200
close the quaw and now there's no quaw
 

1357
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,910
close the quaw and now there's no quaw
power into the ski you see that and

1358
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:10,920
power into the ski you see that and
 

1359
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,349
power into the ski you see that and
you're still injuring your knee if you

1360
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:13,359
you're still injuring your knee if you
 

1361
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,150
you're still injuring your knee if you
turn your foot out it's all this is now

1362
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,160
turn your foot out it's all this is now
 

1363
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,910
turn your foot out it's all this is now
Amplified even worse okay and strangely

1364
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
Amplified even worse okay and strangely
 

1365
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,030
Amplified even worse okay and strangely
you this line gets worse you see and

1366
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,040
you this line gets worse you see and
 

1367
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,710
you this line gets worse you see and
this that other line gets worse too okay

1368
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:29,720
this that other line gets worse too okay
 

1369
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,630
this that other line gets worse too okay
and it's strange because a lot of people

1370
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:31,640
and it's strange because a lot of people
 

1371
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,950
and it's strange because a lot of people
think that this is actually helping you

1372
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:34,960
think that this is actually helping you
 

1373
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,109
think that this is actually helping you
stay on that line but it's not because

1374
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:38,119
stay on that line but it's not because
 

1375
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,430
stay on that line but it's not because
you're generating this Force line right

1376
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
you're generating this Force line right
 

1377
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,030
you're generating this Force line right
and then the other one I'm not going to

1378
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
and then the other one I'm not going to
 

1379
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,470
and then the other one I'm not going to
say it's the the exact opposite is this

1380
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:45,480
say it's the the exact opposite is this
 

1381
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,390
say it's the the exact opposite is this
is the force line to the front do you

1382
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,400
is the force line to the front do you
 

1383
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,430
is the force line to the front do you
see that makes me want to fall that way

1384
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
see that makes me want to fall that way
 

1385
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,829
see that makes me want to fall that way
Who and the other one is more through

1386
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
Who and the other one is more through
 

1387
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,230
Who and the other one is more through
here it cuts through this line here and

1388
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,240
here it cuts through this line here and
 

1389
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,030
here it cuts through this line here and
it's going this way okay so why is that

1390
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
it's going this way okay so why is that
 

1391
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,990
it's going this way okay so why is that
important that second line it cuts

1392
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,000
important that second line it cuts
 

1393
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,750
important that second line it cuts
through here which is why when when I do

1394
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:04,760
through here which is why when when I do
 

1395
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,910
through here which is why when when I do
that you feel that okay all right why is

1396
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:06,920
that you feel that okay all right why is
 

1397
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,750
that you feel that okay all right why is
that important because when you do the

1398
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
that important because when you do the
 

1399
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,470
that important because when you do the
ski you see that that's what gets hit

1400
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:13,480
ski you see that that's what gets hit
 

1401
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,270
ski you see that that's what gets hit
okay and that's where now you're there's

1402
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:16,280
okay and that's where now you're there's
 

1403
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,950
okay and that's where now you're there's
no Mass penetrating the target it

1404
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
no Mass penetrating the target it
 

1405
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,950
no Mass penetrating the target it
bounces off in uh in that remainder of

1406
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:23,960
bounces off in uh in that remainder of
 

1407
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,230
bounces off in uh in that remainder of
inertia right uh Newton's uh law of of

1408
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
inertia right uh Newton's uh law of of
 

1409
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,150
inertia right uh Newton's uh law of of
opposite and equal and it now your

1410
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
opposite and equal and it now your
 

1411
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,230
opposite and equal and it now your
stance absorbs it going this way okay

1412
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
stance absorbs it going this way okay
 

1413
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,870
stance absorbs it going this way okay
all right so let's go back to the other

1414
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:37,880
all right so let's go back to the other
 

1415
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,589
all right so let's go back to the other
correct hip knee foot making that foot

1416
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
correct hip knee foot making that foot
 

1417
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,510
correct hip knee foot making that foot
slightly turned in okay and uh let's pay

1418
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:46,520
slightly turned in okay and uh let's pay
 

1419
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,790
slightly turned in okay and uh let's pay
attention to this angle here remember I

1420
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
attention to this angle here remember I
 

1421
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,790
attention to this angle here remember I
said you're too far forward on this

1422
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:52,800
said you're too far forward on this
 

1423
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,510
said you're too far forward on this
angle okay and let me show you when you

1424
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
angle okay and let me show you when you
 

1425
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,150
angle okay and let me show you when you
you start to apply

1426
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,160
you start to apply
 

1427
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,550
you start to apply
pressure and I want you to keep the

1428
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,560
pressure and I want you to keep the
 

1429
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,109
pressure and I want you to keep the
posture got it so I'm going to apply

1430
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:04,119
posture got it so I'm going to apply
 

1431
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,190
posture got it so I'm going to apply
pressure you're going to keep the

1432
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
pressure you're going to keep the
 

1433
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,109
pressure you're going to keep the
posture keep it hard use all your

1434
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
posture keep it hard use all your
 

1435
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,390
posture keep it hard use all your
muscles to keep it and you tell me where

1436
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:09,400
muscles to keep it and you tell me where
 

1437
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,309
muscles to keep it and you tell me where
you start to feel the pressure keep it

1438
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:11,319
you start to feel the pressure keep it
 

1439
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,030
you start to feel the pressure keep it
hard come on come on almost in my uh

1440
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
hard come on come on almost in my uh
 

1441

where do you feel it in the back yes you

1448
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,280
where do you feel it in the back yes you
 

1449
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,470
where do you feel it in the back yes you
see in the lower back okay which is very

1450
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:29,480
see in the lower back okay which is very
 

1451
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,670
see in the lower back okay which is very
very vulnerable okay so just your just

1452
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:32,680
very vulnerable okay so just your just
 

1453
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,910
very vulnerable okay so just your just
your lower

1454
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:33,920
your lower
 

1455
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,390
your lower
back is actually holding what we think

1456
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:37,400
back is actually holding what we think
 

1457
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,829
back is actually holding what we think
the leg is holding you see a lot of

1458
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:39,839

00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
range penetration do you get it it has
 

1617
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,549
range penetration do you get it it has
better range Integrity better I'm sorry

1618
00:42:57,549 --> 00:42:57,559
better range Integrity better I'm sorry
 

1619
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,630
better range Integrity better I'm sorry
penetration Integrity but does not have

1620
00:42:59,630 --> 00:42:59,640
penetration Integrity but does not have
 

1621
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,270
penetration Integrity but does not have
the same range capacity

1622
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,280
the same range capacity
 

1623
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,069
the same range capacity
okay your change that you made was I

1624
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:06,079
okay your change that you made was I
 

1625
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,549
okay your change that you made was I
didn't go as far out on my angle of

1626
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:08,559
didn't go as far out on my angle of
 

1627
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,390
didn't go as far out on my angle of
deflection angle deviation I adopted the

1628
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
deflection angle deviation I adopted the
 

1629
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,510
deflection angle deviation I adopted the
my for the

1630
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
my for the
 

1631
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,910
my for the
edmi you kept the same old angle

1632
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:18,920
edmi you kept the same old angle
 

1633
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,670
edmi you kept the same old angle
deflection angle deviation range my for

1634
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:22,680
deflection angle deviation range my for
 

1635
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,109
deflection angle deviation range my for
the old range

1636
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
the old range
 

1637
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,309
the old range
penetration capacity do do you get that

1638
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
penetration capacity do do you get that
 

1639
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,069
penetration capacity do do you get that
okay now

1640
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
okay now
 

1641
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,430
okay now
though let's go back and and realize

1642
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
though let's go back and and realize
 

1643
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,109
though let's go back and and realize
there's a reason for

1644
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
there's a reason for
 

1645
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,349
there's a reason for
that let's look at the technique okay go

1646
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:40,359
that let's look at the technique okay go
 

1647
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:44,750
that let's look at the technique okay go
slow and uh here we go what's that what

1648
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:44,760
slow and uh here we go what's that what
 

1649
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,349
slow and uh here we go what's that what
did you just

1650
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359

 

1651
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,670

do what did you just

1652
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
do what did you just
 

1653
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,670
do what did you just
do um what's that called A Clash that's

1654
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
do um what's that called A Clash that's
 

1655
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,549
do um what's that called A Clash that's
a block and there's no blocks in there's

1656
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:56,559
a block and there's no blocks in there's
 

1657
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,589
a block and there's no blocks in there's
no block in iido okay now if he F if he

1658
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:00,599
no block in iido okay now if he F if he
 

1659
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,510
no block in iido okay now if he F if he
full on through that

1660
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:02,520
full on through that
 

1661
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,190
full on through that
strike that little block isn't going to

1662
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
strike that little block isn't going to
 

1663
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,430
strike that little block isn't going to
stop that weapon do do you get it so I

1664
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:08,440
stop that weapon do do you get it so I
 

1665
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,990
stop that weapon do do you get it so I
don't want you to to kill him but kind

1666
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
don't want you to to kill him but kind
 

1667
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,910
don't want you to to kill him but kind
of give it some some energy do you see

1668
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
of give it some some energy do you see
 

1669
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,109
of give it some some energy do you see
okay what are you supposed to do so so

1670
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
okay what are you supposed to do so so
 

1671
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,870
okay what are you supposed to do so so
what kind of training are we doing

1672
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
what kind of training are we doing
 

1673
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,150
what kind of training are we doing
there um we're just working to be strong

1674
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,160
there um we're just working to be strong
 

1675
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,069
there um we're just working to be strong
strong no

1676
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
strong no
 

1677
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,069
strong no
that's we do do that training and it's

1678
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:31,079
that's we do do that training and it's
 

1679
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,990
that's we do do that training and it's
in you that's why you did it but the

1680
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
in you that's why you did it but the
 

1681
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,109
in you that's why you did it but the
understanding is not

1682
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:36,119
understanding is not
 

1683
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,870
understanding is not
accurate so in other words I do hold my

1684
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
accurate so in other words I do hold my
 

1685
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,109
accurate so in other words I do hold my
Joe up and he does touch

1686
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
Joe up and he does touch
 

1687
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,829
Joe up and he does touch
it but I'm not blocking it I'm not

1688
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
it but I'm not blocking it I'm not
 

1689
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,109
it but I'm not blocking it I'm not
trying to be strong you that's what

1690
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:47,119
trying to be strong you that's what
 

1691
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,030
trying to be strong you that's what
that's you understood that okay what are

1692
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,040
that's you understood that okay what are
 

1693
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,069
that's you understood that okay what are
we doing

1694
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
we doing
 

1695
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,109
we doing
instead we what's that training called

1696
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:56,119
instead we what's that training called
 

1697
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,670
instead we what's that training called
the other one is called called

00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:06,359
e EMB embryonic okay so what I'm doing
 

1705
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,069
e EMB embryonic okay so what I'm doing
in embryonic training is his weapon

1706
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
in embryonic training is his weapon

your Joe takes how it got
 

1727
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,750
your Joe takes how it got
there yes that's the same and the angle

1728
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:50,760
there yes that's the same and the angle
 

1729
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,710
there yes that's the same and the angle
that it comes into for the attack
