00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,080

forms are rituals that's how you use

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,090
forms are rituals that's how you use
 

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,839
forms are rituals that's how you use
them to tell tell you what you're doing

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:11,849
them to tell tell you what you're doing
 

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,289
them to tell tell you what you're doing
so let's say on at this point in time I

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:15,299
so let's say on at this point in time I
 

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,220
so let's say on at this point in time I
think oh and my arm comes in like this

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,230

 

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,800

well my arm came in like this because my

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:24,810
well my arm came in like this because my
 

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,560
well my arm came in like this because my
foot is there except over here this

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:27,570
foot is there except over here this
 

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,990
foot is there except over here this
pressure would've been there if I have

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,000
pressure would've been there if I have
 

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,920
pressure would've been there if I have
the other one right my mom is getting

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:36,930
the other one right my mom is getting
 

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,740
the other one right my mom is getting
pulled that way

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:38,750
pulled that way
 

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,440
pulled that way
it's because my foot step down so keep

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,450
it's because my foot step down so keep
 

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,220
it's because my foot step down so keep
the form and use his pressure so that he

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,230
the form and use his pressure so that he
 

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,350
the form and use his pressure so that he
doesn't push on door :

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360

 

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,200

yes difference as opposed to I I was

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,210
yes difference as opposed to I I was
 

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:12,120
yes difference as opposed to I I was
strong

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,130

 

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,109

at the same time James might it's not

30
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
at the same time James might it's not
 

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,429
at the same time James might it's not
that I'm soft

32
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,439
that I'm soft
 

33
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,639
that I'm soft
so James comes and pushes on the on the

34
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:21,649
so James comes and pushes on the on the
 

35
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,840
so James comes and pushes on the on the
integrity of it I'm not going anywhere

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,850
integrity of it I'm not going anywhere
 

37
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,959
integrity of it I'm not going anywhere
do you get that so it's not that there's

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,969
do you get that so it's not that there's
 

39
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:41,499
do you get that so it's not that there's
an integrity to it but I'm not it's just

40
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:41,509
an integrity to it but I'm not it's just
 

41
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:49,149
an integrity to it but I'm not it's just
there whoa okay let's go this is just

42
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:49,159
there whoa okay let's go this is just
 

43
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,479
there whoa okay let's go this is just
basic Chinese philosophy when you've

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:52,489
basic Chinese philosophy when you've
 

45
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,580
basic Chinese philosophy when you've
seen the world a little differently okay

46
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:54,590
seen the world a little differently okay
 

47

00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:58,069
I I create my intentions because I add
 

49
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:03,369
I I create my intentions because I add
to them but I'm not going to be just

50
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:03,379
to them but I'm not going to be just
 

51
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,059
to them but I'm not going to be just
fluffball

52
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:04,069
fluffball
 

53
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:06,190
fluffball
there's a lot of integrity of what I'm

54
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,200
there's a lot of integrity of what I'm
 

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,599
there's a lot of integrity of what I'm
doing so let's go back to this drill so

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:09,609
doing so let's go back to this drill so
 

57
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,629
doing so let's go back to this drill so
one hand inside one hand outside okay

58
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:13,639
one hand inside one hand outside okay
 

59
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,280
one hand inside one hand outside okay
and he's going to push he could do

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,290
and he's going to push he could do
 

61
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,650
and he's going to push he could do
whatever you could move your hand so he

62

whatever you could move your hand so he
 

63
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,180
whatever you could move your hand so he
could do like let's do let's do like

strikes okay then he goes to the strikes

66
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,329
strikes okay then he goes to the strikes
 

67
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:29,170
strikes okay then he goes to the strikes
and I'm going to yield these thing

68
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,180
and I'm going to yield these thing
 

69
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,509
and I'm going to yield these thing
there's a yielding but after there's a

70
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
there's a yielding but after there's a
 

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,400
there's a yielding but after there's a
center connection and now we're on a

72
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,410
center connection and now we're on a
 

73
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,379
center connection and now we're on a
project so I'm gonna practice the

74
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:35,389
project so I'm gonna practice the
 

75
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,229
project so I'm gonna practice the
yielding the yielding of this is just

76
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
yielding the yielding of this is just
 

77
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,120
yielding the yielding of this is just
like this distance to heal did you see

78
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,130
like this distance to heal did you see
 

79
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,030
like this distance to heal did you see
that but neither being too far out or

80
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
that but neither being too far out or
 

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,159
that but neither being too far out or
too far in there's a center connection

82
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,169
too far in there's a center connection
 

83
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,280
too far in there's a center connection
and then maintaining the

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,290
and then maintaining the
 

85
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,160
and then maintaining the
in my floor and because their centre

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,170
in my floor and because their centre
 

87
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,050
in my floor and because their centre
connection I take that integrity of my

88
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,060
connection I take that integrity of my
 

89
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,080
connection I take that integrity of my
for my posture and I penetrate him to

90
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,090
for my posture and I penetrate him to
 

91
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,819
for my posture and I penetrate him to
his center there's a displacement that

92
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:56,829
his center there's a displacement that
 

93
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,160
his center there's a displacement that
happens that's a projection you got it

94
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,170
happens that's a projection you got it
 

95
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,770
happens that's a projection you got it
okay so I don't want you guys to get

96
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:01,780
okay so I don't want you guys to get
 

97
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,750
okay so I don't want you guys to get
trigger so I don't want you to go fast

98
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
trigger so I don't want you to go fast
 

99
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,990
trigger so I don't want you to go fast
at this point I want you to feel it feel

100
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
at this point I want you to feel it feel
 

101
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,399
at this point I want you to feel it feel
it

102
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:07,409
it
 

103
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,240
it
boom if you lose your balance so great

104
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,250
boom if you lose your balance so great
 

105
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,580
boom if you lose your balance so great
Paul don't get stuck on what he's doing

106

Paul don't get stuck on what he's doing
 

107
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,199
Paul don't get stuck on what he's doing
don't get hurt okay

108
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,209
don't get hurt okay
 

109
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,119
don't get hurt okay
I don't go flying through the walls or

110
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:18,129
I don't go flying through the walls or
 

111
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,369
I don't go flying through the walls or
anything and again I don't want this to

112
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:20,379
anything and again I don't want this to
 

113
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,349
anything and again I don't want this to
be so intellectual or you're like wait

114
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:22,359
be so intellectual or you're like wait
 

115
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:42,200
be so intellectual or you're like wait
wait just make contact you push it right

116
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,210

 

117
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,610

when I go I'm not going to I don't want

118
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:47,620
when I go I'm not going to I don't want
 

119
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,640
when I go I'm not going to I don't want
to use the leverage of this levers to

120
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:50,650
to use the leverage of this levers to
 

121
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,060
to use the leverage of this levers to
get that so me where you are trying to

122
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,070
get that so me where you are trying to
 

123
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,160
get that so me where you are trying to
find this Center and you attack the

124
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,170
find this Center and you attack the
 

125
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:16,160
find this Center and you attack the
center so I don't want to shove my arm

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,170

 

127
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,910

okay let's so kind of understand there's

128
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:20,920
okay let's so kind of understand there's
 

129
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,910
okay let's so kind of understand there's
many many ways of creating a topsy-turvy

130
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:23,920
many many ways of creating a topsy-turvy
 

131
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,300
many many ways of creating a topsy-turvy
effect in this one but we were looking

132
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,310
effect in this one but we were looking
 

133
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,210
effect in this one but we were looking
for a particular one maybe not even a

134
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,220
for a particular one maybe not even a
 

135
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,460
for a particular one maybe not even a
topsy-turvy effect so let's say there's

136
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,470
topsy-turvy effect so let's say there's
 

137
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,710
topsy-turvy effect so let's say there's
many many ways of generating and pass

138
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
many many ways of generating and pass
 

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,020
many many ways of generating and pass
the force through his body

140
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,030
the force through his body
 

141
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,290
the force through his body
we're looking for a particular law that

142
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,300
we're looking for a particular law that
 

143
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,290
we're looking for a particular law that
particular one has added benefits that

144
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,300
particular one has added benefits that
 

145
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,910
particular one has added benefits that
other ones don't

146
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:44,920
other ones don't
 

147
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,150
other ones don't
so when he goes right he's going like

148
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
so when he goes right he's going like
 

149
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,060
so when he goes right he's going like
this do you see this Here I am I'm going

150
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,070
this do you see this Here I am I'm going
 

151
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,640
this do you see this Here I am I'm going
to use the leverage of his shoulder you

152
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,650
to use the leverage of his shoulder you
 

153
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,920
to use the leverage of his shoulder you
see that and I'm going to take his Lima

154
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,930
see that and I'm going to take his Lima
 

155
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,930
see that and I'm going to take his Lima
gravity outside of his base of support

156
00:04:59,930 --> 00:04:59,940
gravity outside of his base of support
 

157
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,510
gravity outside of his base of support
to create a fall but I would not say

158
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
to create a fall but I would not say
 

159
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,600
to create a fall but I would not say
that's a projection right so I could do

160
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,610
that's a projection right so I could do
 

161
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,310
that's a projection right so I could do
the same exact thing
