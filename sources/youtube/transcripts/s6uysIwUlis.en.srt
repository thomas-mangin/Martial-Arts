in order to better understand the
relationship of skills to assets let's

146
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
relationship of skills to assets let's
 

147
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,229
relationship of skills to assets let's
compare them to something you might have

a person who is good at managing money
 

161
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,949
a person who is good at managing money
can stretch a dollar a long way or even

looking back at our earlier analogy we

212
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
looking back at our earlier analogy we
 

213
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,430
