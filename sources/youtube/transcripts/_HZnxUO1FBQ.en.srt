00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
little review of the back brake ball I
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,870
little review of the back brake ball I
think we have a couple videos on it but

8
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:09,880
think we have a couple videos on it but
 

9
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,870
think we have a couple videos on it but
give go over it again maybe we'll get

10
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
give go over it again maybe we'll get
 

11
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,910
give go over it again maybe we'll get
better camera angles on it and then give

12
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
better camera angles on it and then give
 

13
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,029
better camera angles on it and then give
you some context for it

14
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:18,039
you some context for it
 

15
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,590
you some context for it
okay

16
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600

 

17
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,310

um the fall is going to utilize the same

18
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:29,320
um the fall is going to utilize the same

kazushi patterns only towards the rear
 

21
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,830
kazushi patterns only towards the rear
so you have a back outward and a back

22
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:36,840
so you have a back outward and a back
 

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,709
so you have a back outward and a back
inward kazushi pattern uh it's going to

00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
inward kazushi pattern uh it's going to
 

25
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,270
inward kazushi pattern uh it's going to
follow the same

26
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
follow the same
 

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,830
follow the same
rules of the x pattern going forward so

28
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
rules of the x pattern going forward so
 

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,069

iido throws but mid-range grappling okay

68
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
iido throws but mid-range grappling okay
 

69
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,230
iido throws but mid-range grappling okay
Judo to me is close range grappling um

70
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
Judo to me is close range grappling um
 

71
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,870
Judo to me is close range grappling um
and and Judo did have mid-range

72
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
and and Judo did have mid-range
 

73
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,749
and and Judo did have mid-range
grappling and in that sense it's just

74
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:54,759
grappling and in that sense it's just
 

75
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,389
grappling and in that sense it's just
like iido okay um but something

76
00:01:59,389 --> 00:01:59,399
like iido okay um but something
 

77
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,950
like iido okay um but something
particular to mid-range grappling is

78
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
particular to mid-range grappling is
 

79
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,190
particular to mid-range grappling is
that you try to throw them outside of

80
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
that you try to throw them outside of
 

81
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,949
that you try to throw them outside of
weapon retention issue that's usually

82
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
weapon retention issue that's usually
 

83
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,350
weapon retention issue that's usually
about 4 feet okay um so they shouldn't

84
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,360
about 4 feet okay um so they shouldn't
 

85
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,030
about 4 feet okay um so they shouldn't
touch the ground until they're 4T away

86
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
touch the ground until they're 4T away
 

87
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,790
touch the ground until they're 4T away
from you meaning you should not all

88
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
from you meaning you should not all
 

89
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,430
from you meaning you should not all
things being equal throw them underneath

90
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
things being equal throw them underneath
 

91
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,710
things being equal throw them underneath
you okay because if you throw them

92
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
you okay because if you throw them
 

93
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,869
you okay because if you throw them
underneath you you're in weapon

94
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
underneath you you're in weapon
 

95
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,630
underneath you you're in weapon
retention issue range um and that's not

96
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
retention issue range um and that's not
 

97
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,350
retention issue range um and that's not
good or they can grab you and you can't

98
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
good or they can grab you and you can't
 

99
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,550
good or they can grab you and you can't
extract yourself from the engagement

100
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
extract yourself from the engagement
 

101
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,630
extract yourself from the engagement
okay so it's very important that we

102
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:41,640
okay so it's very important that we
 

103
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,589
okay so it's very important that we
understand that in nag waza whether it's

104
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
understand that in nag waza whether it's
 

105
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,750
understand that in nag waza whether it's
forward or backwards uh UK should not

106
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
forward or backwards uh UK should not
 

107
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,550

at um another Factor should come in for
 

113
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,589
at um another Factor should come in for
why you're throwing them directly under

114
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
why you're throwing them directly under
 

115

um if we look
 

151
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,350
um if we look
at the nag UK relationship we know that

152
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
at the nag UK relationship we know that
 

153
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,309
at the nag UK relationship we know that
it's a three-dimensional spiral through

154
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
it's a three-dimensional spiral through
 

155
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,910
it's a three-dimensional spiral through
space it's not going to change whether

156
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:00,920
space it's not going to change whether
 

157
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,069

that's going forward or backwards
 

159
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,509

know
 

163
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,470
know
that the same line through here which

164
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,480
that the same line through here which
 

165
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,189
that the same line through here which
establishes that index line uh that is

166
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
establishes that index line uh that is

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
does who tries to stay on a single line
 

329
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,709
does who tries to stay on a single line
whether they do the back break fall or

330
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:33,719
whether they do the back break fall or
 

331
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,469
whether they do the back break fall or
the backwards roll you cannot do a

332
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
the backwards roll you cannot do a
 

333
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,469
the backwards roll you cannot do a
backwards roll unless your Center goes

334
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
backwards roll unless your Center goes
 

335
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,269
backwards roll unless your Center goes
backwards and down but we're not going

336
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:42,279
backwards and down but we're not going
 

337
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,790
backwards and down but we're not going
to let it go backwards and down first

338
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
to let it go backwards and down first
 

339
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,389
to let it go backwards and down first
per prescription you must finally

340
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
per prescription you must finally
 

341
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,870
per prescription you must finally
displace and then secondly we're going

342
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:49,880
displace and then secondly we're going
 

343
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,630
displace and then secondly we're going
to I seiz your Center to continue it

344
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:53,640
to I seiz your Center to continue it
 

345
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,470
to I seiz your Center to continue it
going forward you cannot do a backwards

346
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
going forward you cannot do a backwards
 

347
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,590
going forward you cannot do a backwards
roll or the straight line back back

348
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
roll or the straight line back back
 

349
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,829
roll or the straight line back back
breakfall which I'll demonstrate

350
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839

 

351
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,509

now you can say stand we we'll use this

352
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
now you can say stand we we'll use this
 

353
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,910
now you can say stand we we'll use this
line I don't know which line do you

354
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:08,920
line I don't know which line do you
 

355
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,069
line I don't know which line do you
think you can see the best on the map

356
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:11,079
think you can see the best on the map
 

357
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,310
think you can see the best on the map
through the camera this one okay so here

358
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,320
through the camera this one okay so here
 

359
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,310
through the camera this one okay so here
we have this line on the mat made

360
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
we have this line on the mat made
 

361
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,710
we have this line on the mat made
between the

362
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:19,720
between the
 

363
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,110
between the
tongue and uh it's very common that

364
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,120
tongue and uh it's very common that
 

365
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,150
tongue and uh it's very common that
people want to do some Judo variant in

366
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,160
people want to do some Judo variant in
 

367
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,389
people want to do some Judo variant in
my opinion and it probably works on the

368
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:29,399
my opinion and it probably works on the
 

369
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,790
my opinion and it probably works on the
on the throw where you throw people

370
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
on the throw where you throw people
 

371
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,710
on the throw where you throw people
under you um but we just don't do it so

372
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:35,720
under you um but we just don't do it so
 

373
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,509
under you um but we just don't do it so
uh either your feet remain in place and

374
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:38,519
uh either your feet remain in place and
 

375
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,190
uh either your feet remain in place and
you kind of squat down and your

376
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,200
you kind of squat down and your
 

377
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,350
you kind of squat down and your
back goes back they teach this at the

378
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
back goes back they teach this at the
 

379
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,230
back goes back they teach this at the
Law Enforcement Academy it makes me

380
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,240
Law Enforcement Academy it makes me
 

381
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,030
Law Enforcement Academy it makes me
cringe all the time so the idea is I'll

382
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
cringe all the time so the idea is I'll
 

383
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,190
cringe all the time so the idea is I'll
do it from the side

384
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,200
do it from the side
 

385
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,870
do it from the side
maybe this to show what we're talking

386
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
maybe this to show what we're talking
 

387
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,590
maybe this to show what we're talking
about is they either SWA down back was

388
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
about is they either SWA down back was
 

389
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,910
about is they either SWA down back was
back and they come back up or what have

390
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
back and they come back up or what have
 

391
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,670
back and they come back up or what have
you or go into the

392
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
you or go into the
 

393
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,430
you or go into the
fact sometimes there's a single

394
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,440
fact sometimes there's a single
 

395
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,550
fact sometimes there's a single
foot and uh very common that they go

396
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
foot and uh very common that they go
 

397
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,030
foot and uh very common that they go
down we do the two common things so they

398
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,040
down we do the two common things so they
 

399
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,829
down we do the two common things so they
might take a single foot back and they

400
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
might take a single foot back and they
 

401
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,069
might take a single foot back and they
might go on that heel but a lot of times

402
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
might go on that heel but a lot of times
 

403
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,630
might go on that heel but a lot of times
they use the in step and they go back

404
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:25,640
they use the in step and they go back
 

405
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,790
they use the in step and they go back
again and they do the same thing but if

406
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
again and they do the same thing but if
 

407
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,150
again and they do the same thing but if
you pay pay

408
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
you pay pay
 

409
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,949
you pay pay
attention if that was my angle of attack

410
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
attention if that was my angle of attack
 

411
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,990
attention if that was my angle of attack
as Naga I'm throwing on this

412
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,000
as Naga I'm throwing on this
 

413
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,069
as Naga I'm throwing on this
line my

414
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:41,079
line my
 

415
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,670
line my
head is on the line of attack as you can

416
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
head is on the line of attack as you can
 

417
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,790
head is on the line of attack as you can
so I got pushed this way and I would

418
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
so I got pushed this way and I would
 

419
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,910
so I got pushed this way and I would
fall and my head is on the line of

420
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
fall and my head is on the line of
 

421
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,389
fall and my head is on the line of
attack and the only thing that stopped

422
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
attack and the only thing that stopped
 

423
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,550
attack and the only thing that stopped
me is my slapping which you can't do in

424
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
me is my slapping which you can't do in
 

425
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,550
me is my slapping which you can't do in
the street hurts like f and uh my

426
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
the street hurts like f and uh my
 

427
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,509
the street hurts like f and uh my
abdominal strength basically the only

428
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:04,519
abdominal strength basically the only
 

429
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,069
abdominal strength basically the only
thing stopping me from hitting my head

430
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
thing stopping me from hitting my head
 

431
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,190
thing stopping me from hitting my head
is a y Yong Clash against the throwing

432
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
is a y Yong Clash against the throwing
 

433
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,750
is a y Yong Clash against the throwing
architecture

434
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
architecture
 

435
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,790
architecture
so

436
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800

 

437
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,509

um

438
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:18,519
um
 

439
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,829
um
usually if she has a throwing

440
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:20,839
usually if she has a throwing
 

441
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,030
usually if she has a throwing
architecture just

442
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
architecture just
 

443
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,829
architecture just
relax um and she's working on that line

444
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
relax um and she's working on that line
 

445
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,110
relax um and she's working on that line
she enters and there's the throw and

446
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
she enters and there's the throw and
 

447
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,150
she enters and there's the throw and
then I get accelerated on the line and

448
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
then I get accelerated on the line and
 

449
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,870
then I get accelerated on the line and
then I do that maneuver

450
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880

 

451
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,269

okay that's not going to

452
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:44,279
okay that's not going to
 

453
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:51,470
okay that's not going to
happen if you look at certain

454
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,480

 

455
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,870

things her throw is just an acceleration

456
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:57,880

 

457
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,190

rearward so

458
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,200
rearward so
 

459
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,870
rearward so
I'm not going to fight

460
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm not going to fight
 

461
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,629
I'm not going to fight
her we will deal with that next but as

462
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:05,639
her we will deal with that next but as
 

463
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,990
her we will deal with that next but as
she goes like really fast you can go

464
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,000
she goes like really fast you can go
 

465
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,310
she goes like really fast you can go
fast and hard fast and

466
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
fast and hard fast and
 

467
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,189
fast and hard fast and
hard there was no reason why I couldn't

468
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:15,199
hard there was no reason why I couldn't
 

469
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,470
hard there was no reason why I couldn't
run out of

470
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480

 

471
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,350

that which is what actually

472
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
that which is what actually
 

473
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,269
that which is what actually
most this is right you you accelerate

474
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:26,279
most this is right you you accelerate
 

475
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,470
most this is right you you accelerate
Tristan Bakers and he's going to do that

476
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
Tristan Bakers and he's going to do that
 

477
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,550
Tristan Bakers and he's going to do that
all day to you you right he doesn't know

478
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,560
all day to you you right he doesn't know
 

479
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,069
all day to you you right he doesn't know
any better but a lot of people in the

480
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
any better but a lot of people in the
 

481
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,590
any better but a lot of people in the
fedorite world they don't know better

482
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,600
fedorite world they don't know better
 

483
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,430
fedorite world they don't know better
they don't they don't realize that's

484
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:38,440
they don't they don't realize that's
 

485
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,750
they don't they don't realize that's
just not going to happen Okay so we have

486
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
just not going to happen Okay so we have
 

487
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,389
just not going to happen Okay so we have
to do things

488
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:43,399
to do things
 

489
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,670
to do things
differently so that they can't do

490
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
differently so that they can't do
 

491
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,230
differently so that they can't do
that and what allows me to do

492
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240
that and what allows me to do
 

493
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,790
that and what allows me to do
that as she goes backwards is that

494
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
that as she goes backwards is that
 

495
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,550
that as she goes backwards is that
instead of being a good choreograph you

496
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:57,560
instead of being a good choreograph you
 

497
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,269
instead of being a good choreograph you
and doing that I just keep my hip

498
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279

 

499
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,790

relationship and I'm

500
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800

 

501
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,949

out I have I have control whether I give

502
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
out I have I have control whether I give
 

503
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,829
out I have I have control whether I give
up my hip or whether I

504
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:14,839
up my hip or whether I
 

505
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,430
up my hip or whether I
don't well that's not a CI I I don't

506
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:18,440
don't well that's not a CI I I don't
 

507
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,389
don't well that's not a CI I I don't
seek control

508
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
seek control
 

509
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,230
seek control
okay whether I did that I had control or

510
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
okay whether I did that I had control or
 

511
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,829
okay whether I did that I had control or
whether I do this I have control that's

512
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:26,839
whether I do this I have control that's
 

513
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,750
whether I do this I have control that's
not a Cy but in that that that's where

514
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,760
not a Cy but in that that that's where
 

515
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,269
not a Cy but in that that that's where
you see somebody that can squat down

516
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
you see somebody that can squat down
 

517
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,990
you see somebody that can squat down
they bring their hips down and then they

518
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
they bring their hips down and then they
 

519
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,430
they bring their hips down and then they
Squat and they do the backwards roll or

520
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
Squat and they do the backwards roll or
 

521
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,710
Squat and they do the backwards roll or
the break

522
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
the break
 

523
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,110
the break
ball we're not going to do that okay so

524
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,120
ball we're not going to do that okay so
 

525
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,030
ball we're not going to do that okay so
we have some

526
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
we have some
 

527
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,350
we have some
things we know I'm never going to throw

528
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,360
things we know I'm never going to throw
 

529
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,829
things we know I'm never going to throw
back on that line cuz she can just walk

530
00:13:58,829 --> 00:13:58,839
back on that line cuz she can just walk
 

531
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,870
back on that line cuz she can just walk
back out of

532
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
back out of
 

533
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,110
back out of
it we also

534
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
it we also
 

535
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,310
it we also
know that even her on the same

536
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,320
know that even her on the same
 

537
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,470
know that even her on the same
line because I just push it into that

538
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
line because I just push it into that
 

539
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,470
line because I just push it into that
back

540
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,480
back
 

541
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,069
back
foot she can be very

542
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:15,079
foot she can be very
 

543
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,790
foot she can be very
strong and not going to get it okay that

544
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
strong and not going to get it okay that
 

545
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,550
strong and not going to get it okay that
takes too long that's already not

546
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
takes too long that's already not
 

547
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,470
takes too long that's already not
tactical this just

548
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,480
tactical this just
 

549
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,629
tactical this just
okay so we have to have the hips go

550
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
okay so we have to have the hips go
 

551
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,870
okay so we have to have the hips go
forward

552
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
forward
 

553
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,389
forward
the hips have to go forward I don't want

554
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399
the hips have to go forward I don't want
 

555
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,829
the hips have to go forward I don't want
to push her back onto her other foot

556
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:36,839
to push her back onto her other foot
 

557
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,230
to push her back onto her other foot
this way then she got her hips

558
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,240

 

559
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,470

back so the hips go forward I bring her

560
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
back so the hips go forward I bring her
 

561
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,509
back so the hips go forward I bring her
around and I now bring her this

562
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:52,519

 

563
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,629

way hips go

564
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
way hips go
 

565
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,749
way hips go
forward I bring her around and I go this

566
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:57,759
forward I bring her around and I go this
 

567
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,470
forward I bring her around and I go this
way

568
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
way
 

569
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,910
way
in which case you can see she's not on

570
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:02,920
in which case you can see she's not on
 

571
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,949
in which case you can see she's not on
the line she's never going to be on the

572
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
the line she's never going to be on the
 

573
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,629
the line she's never going to be on the
line okay and of course it won't do it

574
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:09,639
line okay and of course it won't do it
 

575
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,550
line okay and of course it won't do it
to her but when all that's happening

576
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:13,560
to her but when all that's happening
 

577
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,269
to her but when all that's happening
when her body is going forward and then

578
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
when her body is going forward and then
 

579
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,110
when her body is going forward and then
being

580
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
being
 

581
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,389
being
turned and then being brought this

582
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:21,399
turned and then being brought this
 

583
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,790
turned and then being brought this
way we have the X

584
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
way we have the X
 

585
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,710
way we have the X
power okay so her body's coming forward

586
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:29,720
power okay so her body's coming forward
 

587
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,949
power okay so her body's coming forward
hits

588
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
hits
 

589
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,710
hits
up she's going to go this way and that's

590
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
up she's going to go this way and that's
 

591
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,069
up she's going to go this way and that's
where boom we hit that bottom leg so

592
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
where boom we hit that bottom leg so
 

593
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,710
where boom we hit that bottom leg so
it's on this

594
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:41,720
it's on this
 

595
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,470
it's on this
leg I'm going to hold her energy going

596
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
leg I'm going to hold her energy going
 

597
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,030
leg I'm going to hold her energy going
on this way and that's where I boom hit

598
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,040
on this way and that's where I boom hit
 

599
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,949
on this way and that's where I boom hit
that leg

600
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:49,959
that leg
 

601
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,670
that leg
okay and there's no way I don't you just

602
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:54,680
okay and there's no way I don't you just
 

603
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,710
okay and there's no way I don't you just
try to figure it out just go straight

604
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,720
try to figure it out just go straight
 

605
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,829
try to figure it out just go straight
down

606
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
down
 

607
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,590
down
see how her butt has to lower and then

608
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,600
see how her butt has to lower and then
 

609
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,150
see how her butt has to lower and then
she goes back and there she does that

610
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
she goes back and there she does that
 

611
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,829
she goes back and there she does that
there's just absolutely no way she could

612
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
there's just absolutely no way she could
 

613
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,350
there's just absolutely no way she could
do that do you guys get that there's no

614
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,360
do that do you guys get that there's no
 

615
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,590
do that do you guys get that there's no
way okay um so she can't do the

616
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
way okay um so she can't do the
 

617
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,309
way okay um so she can't do the
backwards roll either her hips can't go

618
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:16,319
backwards roll either her hips can't go
 

619
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,069
backwards roll either her hips can't go
back they're not going to be on a

620
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
back they're not going to be on a
 

621
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,470
back they're not going to be on a
straight line and you ain't lowering

622
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
straight line and you ain't lowering
 

623
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,189
straight line and you ain't lowering
 okay make make sense okay so we

624
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:24,199
okay make make sense okay so we
 

625
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,550
okay make make sense okay so we
have to learn this other

626
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
have to learn this other
 

627
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,230
have to learn this other
rle um and that other

628
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
rle um and that other
 

629
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,990
rle um and that other
role is also makes sense that even if

630
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
role is also makes sense that even if
 

631
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,910
role is also makes sense that even if
you could do that other thing it doesn't

632
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:36,920
you could do that other thing it doesn't
 

633
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,309
you could do that other thing it doesn't
makes sense that you leave your target

634
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:39,319
makes sense that you leave your target
 

635
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,910
makes sense that you leave your target
the head which is the

636
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:40,920
the head which is the
 

637
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,350
the head which is the
target of a throw to the back back of

638
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,360
target of a throw to the back back of
 

639
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,629
target of a throw to the back back of
the head is the Target that you would

640
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
the head is the Target that you would
 

641
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,829
the head is the Target that you would
leave your head on the line of attack

642
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
leave your head on the line of attack
 

643
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,790
leave your head on the line of attack
that makes no sense you're supposed to

644
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:51,800
that makes no sense you're supposed to
 

645
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,550
that makes no sense you're supposed to
be doing a non-c contesting art how does

646
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
be doing a non-c contesting art how does
 

647
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,870
be doing a non-c contesting art how does
that make sense but it's everywhere Okay

648
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:57,880
that make sense but it's everywhere Okay
 

649
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,949
that make sense but it's everywhere Okay
so let us get a curved pattern versus a

650
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:03,959
so let us get a curved pattern versus a
 

651
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,630
so let us get a curved pattern versus a
straight pattern okay so I guess you

652
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:07,640
straight pattern okay so I guess you
 

653
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,990
straight pattern okay so I guess you
said this Line's the best okay and we

654
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
said this Line's the best okay and we
 

655
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,510
said this Line's the best okay and we
have these very simple steps to get the

656
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
have these very simple steps to get the
 

657
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,909
have these very simple steps to get the
curve is one I'm on the balls of my

658
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:20,919
curve is one I'm on the balls of my
 

659
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,549
curve is one I'm on the balls of my
feet not the inst steps never go on the

660
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
feet not the inst steps never go on the
 

661
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,789

InStep every time we have broken a foot

662
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:27,799
InStep every time we have broken a foot
 

663
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,870
InStep every time we have broken a foot
here and we

664
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:29,880
here and we
 

665
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,270
here and we
have It's a UK who could not get or did

666
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,280
have It's a UK who could not get or did
 

667
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,870
have It's a UK who could not get or did
not get to their ball of their foot they

668
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
not get to their ball of their foot they
 

669
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,549
not get to their ball of their foot they
tried to use the InStep so I think we've

670
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
tried to use the InStep so I think we've
 

671
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,710
tried to use the InStep so I think we've
had Taylor Sean and Ronan have all

672
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:43,720
had Taylor Sean and Ronan have all
 

673
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,270
had Taylor Sean and Ronan have all
broken their feet for the for the InStep

674
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,280
broken their feet for the for the InStep
 

675
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,870
broken their feet for the for the InStep
am I am I right or no okay he's not in

so you can't you cannot take the force

684
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
so you can't you cannot take the force
 

685
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,310
so you can't you cannot take the force
of your body on your InStep which is why

686
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,320
of your body on your InStep which is why

to where do my hips go and where does my
 

733
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,750
to where do my hips go and where does my
head go or be my hips because that's the

734
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
head go or be my hips because that's the
 

735
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,549
head go or be my hips because that's the
center of gravity line of gravity so as

736
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
center of gravity line of gravity so as
 

737
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,590
center of gravity line of gravity so as
I do this on the line of attack I'm

738
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
I do this on the line of attack I'm
 

739
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,909
I do this on the line of attack I'm
going to go back bring my head off the

740
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
going to go back bring my head off the
 

741
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,549
going to go back bring my head off the
line of attack allow my hips to stay on

742
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:21,559
line of attack allow my hips to stay on
 

743
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,350

the line of

744
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360

 

745
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:35,590

attack it looks like this

746
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600

 

747
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,510

some common mistakes especially if

748
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
some common mistakes especially if
 

749
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,310
some common mistakes especially if
you're coming from fedorite stuff is

750
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
you're coming from fedorite stuff is
 

751
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,190
you're coming from fedorite stuff is
you'll let this turn in this knee will

752
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
you'll let this turn in this knee will
 

753
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,190
you'll let this turn in this knee will
turn in and when it turns in you have

754
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
turn in and when it turns in you have
 

755
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,149
turn in and when it turns in you have
less deviation off the line of attack

756
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:49,159
less deviation off the line of attack
 

757
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,669
less deviation off the line of attack
and you get really close to staying on

758
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
and you get really close to staying on
 

759
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,630
and you get really close to staying on
the line

760
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
the line
 

761
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,990
the line
attack okay so when you take that first

762
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
attack okay so when you take that first
 

763
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,669
attack okay so when you take that first
video and you're going to work through

764
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
video and you're going to work through
 

765
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,590
video and you're going to work through
the progressions make sure that you see

766
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
the progressions make sure that you see
 

767
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,510
the progressions make sure that you see
a 90° deviation in your head in relation

768
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
a 90° deviation in your head in relation
 

769
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,310
a 90° deviation in your head in relation
to the line of attack that should be a

770
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,320
to the line of attack that should be a
 

771
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,390
to the line of attack that should be a
minimum so I'm going out this

772
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:13,400

 

773
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,950

way all right we'll try that

774
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
way all right we'll try that
 

775
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,110
way all right we'll try that
one all right as if your response to

776
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,120
one all right as if your response to
 

777
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,510
one all right as if your response to
actually being thrown for real your UK

778
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
actually being thrown for real your UK
 

779
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,870
actually being thrown for real your UK
is going to they're going to have the

is going to they're going to have the
 

781
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,630
is going to they're going to have the
the bodily experience of get me the

782
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,640
the bodily experience of get me the
 

783
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,390
the bodily experience of get me the
out of this thing okay and that is why

784
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
out of this thing okay and that is why

training is about self-release well You'
 

807
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,350
training is about self-release well You'
proven you can't get to the most basic

808
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
proven you can't get to the most basic
 

809
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,549
proven you can't get to the most basic
of self-release which is release of the

of self-release which is release of the
 

811
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,430
of self-release which is release of the
physical harm of the body okay there's

812

physical harm of the body okay there's
 

813
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,070
physical harm of the body okay there's
harder things to release right like the

degree so you will watch how people will
try to regain control of their Center as

824
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
try to regain control of their Center as
 

825
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,710
try to regain control of their Center as
they try to disengage from the technique

826
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:37,720
they try to disengage from the technique
 

827
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,590
they try to disengage from the technique
and it is very very it's more common on

828
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,600
and it is very very it's more common on
 

829
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,830
and it is very very it's more common on
the back breakfall than the front

830
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
the back breakfall than the front
 

831
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,190
the back breakfall than the front
breakfall uh because there's more sense

832
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,200
breakfall uh because there's more sense
 

833
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,029
breakfall uh because there's more sense
of

834
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
of
 

835
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,430
of
vulnerability uh to falling backwards

836
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
vulnerability uh to falling backwards
 

837
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,950
vulnerability uh to falling backwards
than there is forward um which is why

838
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
than there is forward um which is why
 

839
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,909
than there is forward um which is why
you see like you know self-help groups

840
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
you see like you know self-help groups
 

841
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,149
you see like you know self-help groups
today will have you fall backwards and

842
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
today will have you fall backwards and
 

843

building and all that okay uh
there's just more fear to Fallen

848
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
there's just more fear to Fallen
 

849
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,549
there's just more fear to Fallen
backwards um all right

850
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
backwards um all right
 

851
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,149
backwards um all right
so you have those progressions in the

852
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
so you have those progressions in the
 

853
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,029
so you have those progressions in the
other video and I just want to deal with

854
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
other video and I just want to deal with
 

855
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,710
other video and I just want to deal with
what's most common that's one of the

856
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
what's most common that's one of the
 

857
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,149
what's most common that's one of the
things that's most common and the first

858
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:19,159
things that's most common and the first
 

859
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,110
things that's most common and the first
sign of it is that they'll start to turn

860
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
sign of it is that they'll start to turn
 

861
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,110
sign of it is that they'll start to turn
that knee in uh cuz they want to lower

862
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,120
that knee in uh cuz they want to lower
 

863
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,789
that knee in uh cuz they want to lower
themselves more um but they won't be

864
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:27,799
themselves more um but they won't be
 

865
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,909
themselves more um but they won't be
able to in the technique now they can't

866
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
able to in the technique now they can't
 

867
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,750
able to in the technique now they can't
train cuz they can't receive the

868
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
train cuz they can't receive the
 

869
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,630
train cuz they can't receive the
technique uh I had one great story from

870
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
technique uh I had one great story from
 

871
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,070
technique uh I had one great story from
Chiba Sensei um where he actually left

872
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,080
Chiba Sensei um where he actually left
 

873
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,510
Chiba Sensei um where he actually left
our Ken chus class uh out the back door

our Ken chus class uh out the back door
 

875
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,070
our Ken chus class uh out the back door
so we didn't even know he left uh he

876
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,080
so we didn't even know he left uh he
 

877
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,710
so we didn't even know he left uh he
just left the mat and said if you cannot

878
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:47,720
just left the mat and said if you cannot
 

879
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,350
just left the mat and said if you cannot
receive the technique I cannot teach the

880
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,360
receive the technique I cannot teach the
 

881
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,149
receive the technique I cannot teach the
technique and then he just we was gone

882
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:53,159
technique and then he just we was gone
 

883
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,630
technique and then he just we was gone
and I think we were all waiting for him

884
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
and I think we were all waiting for him

dojo
 

891
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,430
dojo
okay so very very key if you cannot

892
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
okay so very very key if you cannot
 

893
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,470
okay so very very key if you cannot
receive the AR I cannot transmit the art

894
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:05,480
receive the AR I cannot transmit the art
 

895
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,269
receive the AR I cannot transmit the art
okay um the next part where you see a

896
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:09,279
okay um the next part where you see a
 

897
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,789
okay um the next part where you see a
breakdown is that and and is fear

898
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
breakdown is that and and is fear
 

899
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,750
breakdown is that and and is fear
related as they try to regain control of

900
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
related as they try to regain control of
 

901
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,830
related as they try to regain control of
their Center is they'll lose

902
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
their Center is they'll lose
 

903
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,029
their Center is they'll lose
relationship between the extremities of

904
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,039
relationship between the extremities of
 

905
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,669
relationship between the extremities of
the body um and so you what I mean by

906
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:24,679
the body um and so you what I mean by
 

907
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,510
the body um and so you what I mean by
that is as they're falling backwards

908
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
that is as they're falling backwards
 

909
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,470
that is as they're falling backwards
they kind of break

910
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:29,480
they kind of break
 

911
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,750
they kind of break
the posture that allows them to land

912
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
the posture that allows them to land
 

913
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,070
the posture that allows them to land
safely okay so you'll get things like

914
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,080
safely okay so you'll get things like
 

915
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,390
safely okay so you'll get things like
they fall loose like that okay uh that's

916
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,400
they fall loose like that okay uh that's
 

917
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,470
they fall loose like that okay uh that's
very

918
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
very
 

919
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,390
very
dangerous uh Adam you were doing that a

920
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,400
dangerous uh Adam you were doing that a
 

921
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,789
dangerous uh Adam you were doing that a
lot it's but it's very common you cannot

922
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
lot it's but it's very common you cannot
 

923
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,310
lot it's but it's very common you cannot
uh disengage your internal

924
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,320
uh disengage your internal
 

925
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,269
uh disengage your internal
organization uh when you take you KMI so

926
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:54,279
organization uh when you take you KMI so
 

927
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,710
organization uh when you take you KMI so
you have to maintain

928
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
you have to maintain
 

929
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,669
you have to maintain
organization uh for the internals

930
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
organization uh for the internals
 

931
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,990
organization uh for the internals
throughout the throughout the fall so

932
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,000
throughout the throughout the fall so
 

933
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,470
throughout the throughout the fall so
some drills that we do that is we

934
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:05,480
some drills that we do that is we
 

935
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,390
some drills that we do that is we
establish a relationship between the

936
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,400
establish a relationship between the
 

937
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,110
establish a relationship between the
head and foot if you maintain a

938
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
head and foot if you maintain a
 

939
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,789
head and foot if you maintain a
relationship between the head and foot

940
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:11,799
relationship between the head and foot
 

941
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,110
relationship between the head and foot
then you're likely to be organized

942
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,120
then you're likely to be organized
 

943
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,070
then you're likely to be organized
through the midsection and thereby

944
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
through the midsection and thereby
 

945
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,669
through the midsection and thereby
you're likely to uh land in a safer way

946
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:20,679
you're likely to uh land in a safer way
 

947
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,470
you're likely to uh land in a safer way
without spinal injury or organ damage

948
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
without spinal injury or organ damage
 

949
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,389
without spinal injury or organ damage
okay so one of the drills that we have

950
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:27,399
okay so one of the drills that we have
 

951
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,149
okay so one of the drills that we have
for that is where

952
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:29,159
for that is where
 

953
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,789
for that is where
I learned to tie together the foot and

954
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:33,799
I learned to tie together the foot and
 

955
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,630
I learned to tie together the foot and
the

956
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
the
 

957
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,630
the
head and we're coming around like this

958
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
head and we're coming around like this
 

959
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,909
head and we're coming around like this
it doesn't do me any good if I do this

960
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:40,919
it doesn't do me any good if I do this
 

961
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,669
it doesn't do me any good if I do this
drill like

962
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
drill like
 

963
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,269
drill like
this I lock my

964
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:46,279
this I lock my
 

965
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,110
this I lock my
body in my

body in my
 

967
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,510
body in my
organization and I do the

968
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
organization and I do the
 

969
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,070
organization and I do the
drill and Tra

970
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
drill and Tra
 

971

that helps you keep safe for the impact

978
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:07,640
that helps you keep safe for the impact
 

979
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,149
that helps you keep safe for the impact
on the mat is the pelvic

980
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:11,159
on the mat is the pelvic
 

981
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,669
on the mat is the pelvic
tilt

982
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:12,679
tilt
 

983
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,350
tilt
um it tends to go out of the Tilt again

984
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,360
um it tends to go out of the Tilt again
 

985
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,070
um it tends to go out of the Tilt again
because of the

986
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
because of the
 

987
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,990
because of the
egocentricity which brings a loss of

988
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,000
egocentricity which brings a loss of
 

989
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,350
egocentricity which brings a loss of
awareness and uh it starts to add

990
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,360
awareness and uh it starts to add
 

991
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,310
awareness and uh it starts to add
towards the likelihood that you

992
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
towards the likelihood that you
 

993
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,070
towards the likelihood that you
segmented when you hit the mat uh

994
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,080
segmented when you hit the mat uh
 

995
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,669
segmented when you hit the mat uh
increasing the risk of spinal injury or

996
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
increasing the risk of spinal injury or
 

997
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,990
increasing the risk of spinal injury or
organ injury okay so when you're in that

998
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,000
organ injury okay so when you're in that
 

999
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,430
organ injury okay so when you're in that
final position you're not here but there

1000
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
final position you're not here but there
 

1001
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,350
final position you're not here but there
is a tilting up of your pelvis and the

1002
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,360
is a tilting up of your pelvis and the
 

1003
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,110
is a tilting up of your pelvis and the
drill we have for that one is this

1004
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,120

 

1005
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,149

drill so I'm not moving my hands and

1006
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:53,159
drill so I'm not moving my hands and
 

1007
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,269
drill so I'm not moving my hands and
feet I'm tilting my pelvis to do that

1008
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
feet I'm tilting my pelvis to do that
 

1009
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,909
feet I'm tilting my pelvis to do that
drill with this in mind you can see how

1010
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
drill with this in mind you can see how
 

1011
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,750
drill with this in mind you can see how
I'm doing that in the later progressions

1012
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
I'm doing that in the later progressions
 

1013
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,789
I'm doing that in the later progressions
as I drop

1014
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:09,799
as I drop
 

1015
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,470
as I drop
down I'm in that same tuck pelvis and

1016
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
down I'm in that same tuck pelvis and
 

1017
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,149
down I'm in that same tuck pelvis and
there's a relationship between my head

1018
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:17,159
there's a relationship between my head
 

1019
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,870
there's a relationship between my head
and foot from the very beginning so as I

1020
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
and foot from the very beginning so as I
 

1021
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,549
and foot from the very beginning so as I
go down my head goes back my leg will

1022
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:25,559
go down my head goes back my leg will
 

1023
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,389
go down my head goes back my leg will
extend

1024
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:28,399
extend
 

1025
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,149
extend
and you're in this

1026
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:31,159
and you're in this
 

1027
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,149
and you're in this
drill okay so we're going to work from a

1028
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:35,159
drill okay so we're going to work from a
 

1029
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,389
drill okay so we're going to work from a
standing progression down making sure we

1030
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:38,399
standing progression down making sure we
 

1031
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,269
standing progression down making sure we
have that pelvic tilt we're not going to

1032
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
have that pelvic tilt we're not going to
 

1033
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,070
have that pelvic tilt we're not going to
do those developmental drills where you

1034
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
do those developmental drills where you
 

1035
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,269
do those developmental drills where you
roll around in a circle or just flex

1036
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:46,279
roll around in a circle or just flex
 

1037
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,310
roll around in a circle or just flex
your pelvic tilt we're going to work one

1038
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
your pelvic tilt we're going to work one
 

1039
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,630
your pelvic tilt we're going to work one
of the

1040
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
of the
 

1041
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,750
of the
progressions okay try so we have those

1042
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
progressions okay try so we have those
 

1043
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,230
progressions okay try so we have those
progressions and we also have these kind

1044
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
progressions and we also have these kind
 

1045
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,909
progressions and we also have these kind
of body consciousness aware body

1046
00:26:58,909 --> 00:26:58,919
of body consciousness aware body
 

1047
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,750
of body consciousness aware body
awareness drills the one where you go

1048
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
awareness drills the one where you go
 

1049
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,630
awareness drills the one where you go
around in a circle and the one where you

1050
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:03,640
around in a circle and the one where you
 

1051
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,789
around in a circle and the one where you
flex but you can see those that they're

1052
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
flex but you can see those that they're
 

1053
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,470
flex but you can see those that they're
not right as you're instructing on them

1054
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,480
not right as you're instructing on them
 

1055
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,470
not right as you're instructing on them
okay uh the next drill that we have that

1056
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:13,480
okay uh the next drill that we have that
 

1057
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,830
okay uh the next drill that we have that
we use is um to take

1058
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840
we use is um to take
 

1059
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,430
we use is um to take
away or to acclimate the UK to find the

1060
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
away or to acclimate the UK to find the
 

1061
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,669
away or to acclimate the UK to find the
ultimate the final projection or sorry

1062
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:26,679
ultimate the final projection or sorry
 

1063
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,950
ultimate the final projection or sorry
progression in that sequence in that

1064
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
progression in that sequence in that
 

1065
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,630
progression in that sequence in that
previous video but not being in control

1066
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
previous video but not being in control
 

1067
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,990
previous video but not being in control
of when and at what rate of energy okay

1068
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
of when and at what rate of energy okay
 

1069
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,990
of when and at what rate of energy okay
uh so that's what we do now so he has to

1070
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,000
uh so that's what we do now so he has to
 

1071
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,950
uh so that's what we do now so he has to
get all the way to his final progression

1072
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:43,960
get all the way to his final progression
 

1073
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,750
get all the way to his final progression
and then we do something like this okay

1074
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:46,760
and then we do something like this okay
 

1075
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,430
and then we do something like this okay
maybe we have to come from the

1076
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440

 

1077
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,470

side okay so to be clear at some point

1078
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
side okay so to be clear at some point
 

1079
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,430
side okay so to be clear at some point
he learned the progression where he

1080
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
he learned the progression where he
 

1081
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,509
he learned the progression where he
steps back and he goes

1082
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:01,519
steps back and he goes
 

1083
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,830
steps back and he goes
down okay cool I see a tilt I see a head

1084
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:04,840
down okay cool I see a tilt I see a head
 

1085
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,669
down okay cool I see a tilt I see a head
and foot relationship okay and his head

1086
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
and foot relationship okay and his head
 

1087
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,630
and foot relationship okay and his head
is 90° to the line of attack all right

1088
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:11,640
is 90° to the line of attack all right
 

1089
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,149
is 90° to the line of attack all right
uh we start having him bring it up to a

1090
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
uh we start having him bring it up to a
 

1091
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,950
uh we start having him bring it up to a
jog on his own this is the other

1092
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
jog on his own this is the other
 

1093
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,389
jog on his own this is the other
progression down he does the same thing

1094
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:19,399
progression down he does the same thing
 

1095
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,549
progression down he does the same thing
okay you can have a lot of people that

1096
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:21,559
okay you can have a lot of people that
 

1097
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,870
okay you can have a lot of people that
can do that one uh because they're in

1098
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
can do that one uh because they're in
 

1099
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,549
can do that one uh because they're in
control that is why okay so we start to

1100
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
control that is why okay so we start to
 

1101
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,590
control that is why okay so we start to
take some control away uh and at first

1102
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
take some control away uh and at first
 

1103
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,669
take some control away uh and at first
it doesn't matter the to what degree uh

1104
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
it doesn't matter the to what degree uh
 

1105
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,950
it doesn't matter the to what degree uh
but they don't know the when or or at

1106
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:37,960
but they don't know the when or or at
 

1107
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,029
but they don't know the when or or at
what rate and it could be very low and

1108
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:40,039
what rate and it could be very low and
 

1109
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,310
what rate and it could be very low and
you start to see technique fall apart so

1110
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
you start to see technique fall apart so
 

1111
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,909
you start to see technique fall apart so
all I do is push him into that

1112
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
all I do is push him into that
 

1113
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,070
all I do is push him into that
fall and he goes down and you just keep

1114
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,080
fall and he goes down and you just keep
 

1115
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,990
fall and he goes down and you just keep
doing that back and forth you

1116
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000

 

1117
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,789

know and as you're getting it and he

1118
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
know and as you're getting it and he
 

1119
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,710
know and as you're getting it and he
gets there you you should be able to

1120
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
gets there you you should be able to
 

1121
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,630
gets there you you should be able to
start shoving really

1122
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:01,640
start shoving really
 

1123
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,350
start shoving really
hard he has to be able to keep the form

1124
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
hard he has to be able to keep the form
 

1125
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,789
hard he has to be able to keep the form
okay um anyone who breaks the structure

1126
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
okay um anyone who breaks the structure
 

1127
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,909
okay um anyone who breaks the structure
the necessary organization there you got

1128
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:12,919
the necessary organization there you got
 

1129
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,470
the necessary organization there you got
to come back to the earlier progressions

1130
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
to come back to the earlier progressions
 

1131
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,789
to come back to the earlier progressions
and get them to do that however you have

1132
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
and get them to do that however you have
 

1133
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,070
and get them to do that however you have
to be realistic that the art is

1134
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,080
to be realistic that the art is
 

1135
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,630
to be realistic that the art is
ultimately a spiritual art one that

1136
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,640
ultimately a spiritual art one that
 

1137
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,350
ultimately a spiritual art one that
requires the reconciliation of fear and

1138
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,360
requires the reconciliation of fear and
 

1139
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,149
requires the reconciliation of fear and
at a certain point there is no

1140
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:29,159
at a certain point there is no
 

1141
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,430
at a certain point there is no
biomechanical progression that's going

1142
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
biomechanical progression that's going
 

1143
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,149
biomechanical progression that's going
to solve that okay meaning some people

1144
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:35,159
to solve that okay meaning some people
 

1145
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,750
to solve that okay meaning some people
will just not you'll never be able to

drill with those biomechanical

1154
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
drill with those biomechanical
 

1155
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,830
drill with those biomechanical
progressions okay um the next one we

1156
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:50,840
progressions okay um the next one we
 

1157
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,870

deconstructing his basic support so we

1188
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:37,880
deconstructing his basic support so we
 

1189
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,350
deconstructing his basic support so we
want to have some more drills that help

1190
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:40,360
want to have some more drills that help
 

1191

want to have some more drills that help
someone get in the

1192
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:43,399
someone get in the
 

1193
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,389
someone get in the
ballpark okay of where we're ultimately

1194
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:47,399
ballpark okay of where we're ultimately
 

1195
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,509
ballpark okay of where we're ultimately
going um so the first drill is we'll

1196
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:50,519
going um so the first drill is we'll
 

1197
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,509
going um so the first drill is we'll
give him back control and we know that

1198
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:53,519
give him back control and we know that
 

1199
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,950
give him back control and we know that
his Center has to be forward so we'll

1200
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
his Center has to be forward so we'll
 

1201
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,389
his Center has to be forward so we'll
have him Bend his forward bring it bring

1202
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
have him Bend his forward bring it bring
 

1203
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,990
have him Bend his forward bring it bring
his Center forward and then on his own

1204
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,000
his Center forward and then on his own
 

1205
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,750
his Center forward and then on his own
he will find the back foot okay we going

1206
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:06,760
he will find the back foot okay we going
 

1207
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,909
he will find the back foot okay we going
do that again um because in the other

1208
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
do that again um because in the other
 

1209
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,909
do that again um because in the other
drills he's able to step back see his

1210
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:12,919
drills he's able to step back see his
 

1211
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,430
drills he's able to step back see his
Center doesn't go forward it goes down

1212
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
Center doesn't go forward it goes down
 

1213
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,350
Center doesn't go forward it goes down
and he goes on but now we want his

1214

back

1220
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,320
back
 

1221
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,149
back
foot and we have them do that until they

1222
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
foot and we have them do that until they
 

1223
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,789
foot and we have them do that until they
can get that uh

1224
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:29,799
can get that uh
 

1225
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,549
can get that uh
in this

1226
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559

 

1227
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,230

drill um it allows the scaredy cat UK to

1228
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
drill um it allows the scaredy cat UK to
 

1229
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,549
drill um it allows the scaredy cat UK to
still have a lot of control find the

1230
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
still have a lot of control find the
 

1231
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,190
still have a lot of control find the
front foot and also uh decide whether

1232
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
front foot and also uh decide whether
 

1233
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,509
front foot and also uh decide whether
they want the foot to go first or the

1234
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
they want the foot to go first or the
 

1235
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,350
they want the foot to go first or the
hand to go first and they usually pick

1236
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,360
hand to go first and they usually pick
 

1237
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,830
hand to go first and they usually pick
the foot um so we're going to uh make

1238
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
the foot um so we're going to uh make
 

1239
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,310
the foot um so we're going to uh make
more extreme how much hips are forward

1240
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,320
more extreme how much hips are forward
 

1241
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,190
more extreme how much hips are forward
and he now cannot

1242
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,200
and he now cannot
 

1243
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,750
and he now cannot
step back into the front foot he has to

1244
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
step back into the front foot he has to
 

1245
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,190
step back into the front foot he has to
almost jump on it but it's that's a bad

1246
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,200
almost jump on it but it's that's a bad
 

1247
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,590
almost jump on it but it's that's a bad
understanding it's more like a cat when

1249
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,149
understanding it's more like a cat when
you turn a cat upside down the cat will

1250
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
you turn a cat upside down the cat will
 

1251
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,950
you turn a cat upside down the cat will
find the floor um and have their foot

1252
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:15,960
find the floor um and have their foot
 

1253

the next rep he has to pick the other

1272
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:42,279
the next rep he has to pick the other
 

1273

to how clean an X and how deep an X you
 

1547
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,309
to how clean an X and how deep an X you
have okay so meaning uh if my UK this

1548
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
have okay so meaning uh if my UK this
 

1549
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,349
have okay so meaning uh if my UK this
can't do it then I could have entered

that's a shallower less sharp X if my UK

1554

sometimes they don't okay it really has
 

1595
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:05,430
sometimes they don't okay it really has
to do with how sharply the nogget was
