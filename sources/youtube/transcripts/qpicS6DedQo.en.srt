hi in this video I'm going to be

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:02,399
hi in this video I'm going to be
 

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,790
hi in this video I'm going to be
covering the second mode that I use in

4
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:03,800
covering the second mode that I use in
 

5
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,230
covering the second mode that I use in
Indian clubs my previous video covered

6
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
Indian clubs my previous video covered
 

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,629
Indian clubs my previous video covered
the first mode which was same time same

8
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
the first mode which was same time same
 

9
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,669
the first mode which was same time same
direction if you haven't already seen it

10
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:10,679
direction if you haven't already seen it
 

11
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,110
direction if you haven't already seen it
I'll post a link in the description

12
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,120
I'll post a link in the description
 

13
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,350
I'll post a link in the description
below so if you go watch that and then

14
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,360
below so if you go watch that and then
 

15
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,870
below so if you go watch that and then
come back to

16
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:15,880
come back to
 

17
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,790
come back to
this in this video I'm going to be

18
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:17,800
this in this video I'm going to be
 

19
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,870
this in this video I'm going to be
covering same time opposite direction

20
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:19,880
covering same time opposite direction
 

21
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,349
covering same time opposite direction
which is the second mode demonstrating

22
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359
which is the second mode demonstrating
 

23
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,790
which is the second mode demonstrating
the movements here without clubs just

24
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
the movements here without clubs just
 

25
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,189
the movements here without clubs just
like in mode one you need to be aware of

26
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
like in mode one you need to be aware of
 

27
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,950
like in mode one you need to be aware of
the four key

28
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
the four key
 

29
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,589
the four key
points

30
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
points
 

31
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,350
points
so as you can see here the left and

32
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:32,360
so as you can see here the left and
 

33
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,030
so as you can see here the left and
right hand are mirroring each other um

34
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
right hand are mirroring each other um
 

35
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,950
right hand are mirroring each other um
and I'm also alternating which hand goes

36
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:37,960
and I'm also alternating which hand goes
 

37
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,389
and I'm also alternating which hand goes
on top so it'll be right on the left and

38
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399
on top so it'll be right on the left and
 

39
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,630
on top so it'll be right on the left and
left on the

40
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640

 

41
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,830

right so like with all modes there's two

42
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
right so like with all modes there's two
 

43
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,189
right so like with all modes there's two
directions so with the previous one I

44
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:50,199
directions so with the previous one I
 

45
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,790
directions so with the previous one I
was going inwards with this one I'm

46
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
was going inwards with this one I'm
 

47
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,630
was going inwards with this one I'm
going

48
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
going
 

49
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,709
going
outwards you can see here I'm also

50
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
outwards you can see here I'm also
 

51
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,430
outwards you can see here I'm also
paying attention to the key points left

52
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
paying attention to the key points left
 

53
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,790
paying attention to the key points left
and right and the bottom and

54
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
and right and the bottom and
 

55
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,650
and right and the bottom and
top so once you've got that just smooth

56
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:04,660
top so once you've got that just smooth
 

57
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,190
top so once you've got that just smooth
[Music]

58
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200

 

59
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,030

out okay one of the mistakes to look at

60
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
out okay one of the mistakes to look at
 

61
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,030
out okay one of the mistakes to look at
is where people raise their shoulders

62
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
is where people raise their shoulders
 

63
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,270
is where people raise their shoulders
like this what you want to do is drop

64
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
like this what you want to do is drop
 

65
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,149
like this what you want to do is drop
your shoulders back to a nice

66
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,159
your shoulders back to a nice
 

67
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,630
your shoulders back to a nice
comfortable relaxed position and just

68
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:19,640
comfortable relaxed position and just
 

69
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,109
comfortable relaxed position and just
maintain that structure

70
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119

 

71
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,950

throughout okay then let's have a look

72
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
throughout okay then let's have a look
 

73
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,030
throughout okay then let's have a look
with clubs so obviously both arms can't

74
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,040
with clubs so obviously both arms can't
 

75
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,030
with clubs so obviously both arms can't
exactly mirror cuz otherwise the club

76
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040
exactly mirror cuz otherwise the club
 

77
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,510
exactly mirror cuz otherwise the club
will Clash like

78
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
will Clash like
 

79
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,190
will Clash like
this so to get around this if you shift

80
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
this so to get around this if you shift
 

81
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,789
this so to get around this if you shift
one side of your body backwards and the

82
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
one side of your body backwards and the
 

83
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,149
one side of your body backwards and the
other forwards this enables the clubs to

84
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:39,159
other forwards this enables the clubs to
 

85
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,389
other forwards this enables the clubs to
pass each other here you can see I'm

86
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:41,399
pass each other here you can see I'm
 

87
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,830
pass each other here you can see I'm
exaggerating the movement once you

88
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
exaggerating the movement once you
 

89
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,350
exaggerating the movement once you
comfortable with you can reduce the

90
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
comfortable with you can reduce the
 

91
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,310
comfortable with you can reduce the
amount the

92
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,320
amount the
 

93
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,109
amount the
shift so same for swinging outwards this

94
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:48,119
shift so same for swinging outwards this
 

95
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,109
shift so same for swinging outwards this
time instead of crossing the clubs at

96
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:50,119
time instead of crossing the clubs at
 

97
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,590
time instead of crossing the clubs at
the top you want to be Crossing them at

98
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
the top you want to be Crossing them at
 

99
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,510
the top you want to be Crossing them at
the bottom and following the same

100
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
the bottom and following the same
 

101
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,789
the bottom and following the same
principles of Shifting forward and the

102
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
principles of Shifting forward and the
 

103
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,830
principles of Shifting forward and the
other back

104
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
other back
 

105
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,910
other back
ones

106
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:00,920
ones
 

107
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,990
ones
so to demonstrate the movement here's an

108
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,000
so to demonstrate the movement here's an
 

109
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,669
so to demonstrate the movement here's an

I'm doing a Rael if you just take one

122
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm doing a Rael if you just take one
 

123
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,470
I'm doing a Rael if you just take one
hand and do a real

124
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,480
hand and do a real
 

125
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,190
hand and do a real
and then try straighten up your body and

126
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
and then try straighten up your body and
 

127
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,390
and then try straighten up your body and
rather than turning do the same movement

128
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,400
rather than turning do the same movement
 

129
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,509
rather than turning do the same movement
of the re just opening up your

00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519

 

131
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:49,030

chest and moving from your

132
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040

 

133
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,309

elbow so if you're try and get the key

134
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:51,319
elbow so if you're try and get the key
 

135
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,830
elbow so if you're try and get the key
points as well so mooving to the right

136
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
points as well so mooving to the right
 

137
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,430
points as well so mooving to the right
then to the top of the head and then

138
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
then to the top of the head and then
 

139
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,990
then to the top of the head and then
round the front back down and then try

140
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
round the front back down and then try
 

141
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,430
round the front back down and then try
and smooth the movement out

142
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
and smooth the movement out
 

143
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,309
and smooth the movement out
so here I'm mirroring the movement with

144
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:03,319
so here I'm mirroring the movement with
 

145
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,309
so here I'm mirroring the movement with
my left hand trying to hit those key

146
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
my left hand trying to hit those key
 

147
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,990
my left hand trying to hit those key
points once I've done that I want to try

148
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
points once I've done that I want to try
 

149
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,990
points once I've done that I want to try
and smooth the movement

150
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000

 

151
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,390

out okay so once you're happy with that

152
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400
out okay so once you're happy with that
 

153
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,390
out okay so once you're happy with that
both sides uh you then just mirror the

154
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,400
both sides uh you then just mirror the
 

155
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,470
both sides uh you then just mirror the
movement and remember the same idea

156
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
movement and remember the same idea
 

157
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,990
movement and remember the same idea
about Crossing that arms at the top and

158
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
about Crossing that arms at the top and
 

159
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,630
about Crossing that arms at the top and
you're going inwards

160
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,640
you're going inwards
 

161
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,309
you're going inwards

165
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,990

the so now with my right hand I'm going

166
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,000
the so now with my right hand I'm going
 

167
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,869
the so now with my right hand I'm going
outwards doing the full turn as if I was

168
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
outwards doing the full turn as if I was
 

169
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,509
outwards doing the full turn as if I was
doing a

170
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:46,519
