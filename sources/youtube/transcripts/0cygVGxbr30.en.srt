now you have the beginning of position
 

163
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,000
now you have the beginning of position
okay so the first thing we want to do is

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,010
okay so the first thing we want to do is
 

165
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,100
okay so the first thing we want to do is
we want to just extend the Kazushi out

166
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,110
we want to just extend the Kazushi out
 

167
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,920
we want to just extend the Kazushi out
this way this is to get a feeling that

168
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:11,930
this way this is to get a feeling that
 

169
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:22,140
this way this is to get a feeling that
so I'm polling it kinda by letting it go

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:11,099
okay so he's already losing his balance
 

187
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,760
okay so he's already losing his balance
right so here I'm just gonna add to that

188
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:13,770
right so here I'm just gonna add to that
 

189
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,059
right so here I'm just gonna add to that
right he was falling so he go he's going

190
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:17,069
right he was falling so he go he's going
 

191
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,950
right he was falling so he go he's going
you see he's falling I'm just going to

192
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
you see he's falling I'm just going to
 

193
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:29,629
you see he's falling I'm just going to
add to that you can see how I'm doing

194
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
add to that you can see how I'm doing
 

195
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,969

this so he's already off balance so

he's off balance so when I have my
 

203
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,320
he's off balance so when I have my
fixated movements like katatetori
