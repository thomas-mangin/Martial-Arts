00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,380
tell okay so for example this is
 

143
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,990
tell okay so for example this is
incorrect ok because to misunderstanding

144
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,000
incorrect ok because to misunderstanding

not happening his Joe at this pace and
at that timing is a line that I can use

150
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:40,570
at that timing is a line that I can use
 

151
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:49,560
at that timing is a line that I can use
to get the proper angle for my attack it

okay but not all in the same way and not
 

165
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,139
okay but not all in the same way and not
on all of the same of his being so for

on all of the same of his being so for
 

167
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,130
on all of the same of his being so for
example the when he goes many of you

168
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,140
example the when he goes many of you
 

169
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,990

okay because you related to the line

172
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:27,990
okay because you related to the line
 

173
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,769
okay because you related to the line
which is here but you think the line is

174
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:31,779
which is here but you think the line is
 

175
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,970
which is here but you think the line is
the weapon which is why you move the

176
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:35,980
the weapon which is why you move the
 

177
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,530
the weapon which is why you move the
angle of attack instead the start go is

178
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:43,540
angle of attack instead the start go is
 

179
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,269
angle of attack instead the start go is
there

181
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,300

I'm relating to that intention the birth

182
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,310
I'm relating to that intention the birth
 

183
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,569
I'm relating to that intention the birth
of intention and I give him as my

00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:54,579
of intention and I give him as my
 

185
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,939
of intention and I give him as my
partner here's your intention so he has

00:10:59,939 --> 00:10:59,949
partner here's your intention so he has
 

187
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,910
partner here's your intention so he has
to now give birth to it and I have to

188
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:02,920
to now give birth to it and I have to
 

189
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,170
to now give birth to it and I have to
relate to that I do not relate to the

190
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,180
relate to that I do not relate to the
 

191
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,470
relate to that I do not relate to the
thing I gave him by which he could give

192
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
thing I gave him by which he could give
 

193
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,290
thing I gave him by which he could give
birth to I do not relate to the joke I

194
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,300
birth to I do not relate to the joke I
 

195
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,739
birth to I do not relate to the joke I
relate to the intention so when we go

196
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:18,749
relate to the intention so when we go
 

197
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,960
relate to the intention so when we go
I'm moving with that and there's you're

198
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:21,970
I'm moving with that and there's you're
 

199
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,829
I'm moving with that and there's you're
still doing Joe you're blocking the

200
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
still doing Joe you're blocking the
 

201
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,309
still doing Joe you're blocking the
choke okay and you're stuck on blocking

202
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:29,319
choke okay and you're stuck on blocking
 

203
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,360
choke okay and you're stuck on blocking
the joke because your thing that's an

204
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,370
the joke because your thing that's an
 

205
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,679
the joke because your thing that's an
angle of deflection so he that's the

206
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:37,689
angle of deflection so he that's the
 

207
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:47,900
angle of deflection so he that's the
block and stopped on the person who that

208
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,910
block and stopped on the person who that
 

209
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,499
block and stopped on the person who that
stopped them trust me okay and what do

210
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:52,509
stopped them trust me okay and what do
 

211
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:54,059
stopped them trust me okay and what do
we know is this a good angle of

212
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:54,069
we know is this a good angle of
 

213
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,299
we know is this a good angle of
deflection no because I have the distal

214
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:57,309
deflection no because I have the distal
 

215
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,939
deflection no because I have the distal
end of the lever so I have a mechanical

216
00:11:59,939 --> 00:11:59,949
end of the lever so I have a mechanical
 

217
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:07,319
end of the lever so I have a mechanical
advantage which means stay there that if

218
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:07,329
advantage which means stay there that if
 

219
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,590
advantage which means stay there that if
i push over here then he can be strong

220
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:10,600
i push over here then he can be strong
 

221
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,679
i push over here then he can be strong
but if i push over here hold it up as

222
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:13,689
but if i push over here hold it up as
 

223
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,230
but if i push over here hold it up as
best you can as best you can then he

224
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
best you can as best you can then he
 

225
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,569
best you can as best you can then he
can't okay we use that and i keel all

226
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:18,579
can't okay we use that and i keel all
 

227
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:28,079
can't okay we use that and i keel all
the time so I ago that looks like that's

228
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,089
the time so I ago that looks like that's
 

229
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,329
the time so I ago that looks like that's
what that's going to do all right let's

230
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:30,339
what that's going to do all right let's
 

231
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,290
what that's going to do all right let's
just assume somebody is strong enough to

232
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,300
just assume somebody is strong enough to
 

233
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,059
just assume somebody is strong enough to
overcome the mechanical advantage of the

234
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:36,069
overcome the mechanical advantage of the
 

235
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,970
overcome the mechanical advantage of the
distal end of the lever let's go where's

236
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:38,980
distal end of the lever let's go where's
 

237
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,759
distal end of the lever let's go where's
move wait and now let's do the second

238
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:41,769
move wait and now let's do the second
 

239
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,929
move wait and now let's do the second
loop and the third move so why did that

240
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:48,939
loop and the third move so why did that
 

241
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,850
loop and the third move so why did that
happen tap it

242
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:50,860
happen tap it
 

243
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,610
happen tap it
some weird reason he gives up the center

244
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:53,620
some weird reason he gives up the center
 

245
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,210
some weird reason he gives up the center
line while I'm occupying it and that

246
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,220
line while I'm occupying it and that
 

247
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,190
line while I'm occupying it and that
will happen over and over again there's

248
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
will happen over and over again there's
 

249
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,710
will happen over and over again there's
no no nada anything is going to work

250
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:09,720
no no nada anything is going to work
 

251
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,530
no no nada anything is going to work
well that should tell you then I think

252
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:13,540
well that should tell you then I think
 

253
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,300
well that should tell you then I think
that you're not you're not defending the

training drills so when we go what I'm

258
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:28,600
training drills so when we go what I'm
 

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,530
training drills so when we go what I'm
using is the birth of his intention

260
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:31,540
using is the birth of his intention
 

261
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,510
using is the birth of his intention
which just shows up at the beginning I

262
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:33,520
which just shows up at the beginning I
 

263
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,360
which just shows up at the beginning I
relate to that part of the body and then

264
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,370
relate to that part of the body and then
 

265
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,060
relate to that part of the body and then
after that by using soft contact by

266
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,070
after that by using soft contact by
 

267
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,640
after that by using soft contact by
using the Joe friction I learn the angle

268
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,650
using the Joe friction I learn the angle
 

269
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:58,340
using the Joe friction I learn the angle
of attack of Oprah's head so the drill

270
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,350

 

271
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:05,850

the tactic that's me keeping the same

272
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:05,860
the tactic that's me keeping the same
 

273
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,410
the tactic that's me keeping the same
Joe geometry right working off the same

274
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:10,420
Joe geometry right working off the same
 

275
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,470
Joe geometry right working off the same
attention but I don't have the problems

276
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,480
attention but I don't have the problems
 

277
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,620
attention but I don't have the problems
of the distal end of the lever or

278
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,630
of the distal end of the lever or
 

279
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,890
of the distal end of the lever or
clearing the center so i have to relate

280
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:19,900
clearing the center so i have to relate
 

281
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,470
clearing the center so i have to relate
them what do you do unrelated to his

282
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
them what do you do unrelated to his
 

283
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,420
them what do you do unrelated to his
right okay so i have to do my form like

284
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,430
right okay so i have to do my form like
 

285
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,480
right okay so i have to do my form like
that this is wrong I've moved with his

286
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,490
that this is wrong I've moved with his
 

287
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,140
that this is wrong I've moved with his
boy

288
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,150

 

289
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,830

and I move my weapon so that his weapon

290
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:40,840
and I move my weapon so that his weapon
 

291
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,270
and I move my weapon so that his weapon
doesn't mean if you now look your body

292
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,280
doesn't mean if you now look your body
 

293
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,350
doesn't mean if you now look your body
angle and I did that and we go to the

294
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
angle and I did that and we go to the
 

295
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,690
angle and I did that and we go to the
tactic go back slow I go like this I'm

296
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:57,700
tactic go back slow I go like this I'm
 

297
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,810
tactic go back slow I go like this I'm
wasting a lot of motion and I'm going to

298
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:00,820
wasting a lot of motion and I'm going to
 

299
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,660
wasting a lot of motion and I'm going to
have to change angles at some point to

300
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,670
have to change angles at some point to
 

301
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,550
have to change angles at some point to
get the downward angle which is the

302
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:05,560
get the downward angle which is the
 

303
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,310
get the downward angle which is the
angle cancellation on his face right

304
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
angle cancellation on his face right
 

305
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,810
angle cancellation on his face right
because I'm here and at some point I

306
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:11,820
because I'm here and at some point I
 

307
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,250
because I'm here and at some point I
going to have to do that so I'm going to

308
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,260
going to have to do that so I'm going to
 

309
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,500
going to have to do that so I'm going to
lose momentum and will always force it

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,510
lose momentum and will always force it
 

311
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,500
lose momentum and will always force it
impact then the second thing is watch

312
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,510
impact then the second thing is watch
 

313
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,880
impact then the second thing is watch
that angle and watch my center line i

314
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:25,890
that angle and watch my center line i
 

315
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,430
that angle and watch my center line i
just opened it but the other one is

316
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440

 

317
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,020

closed off it goes past my target

318
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,030
closed off it goes past my target
 

319
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,490
closed off it goes past my target
because i don't know what he's going to

320
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,500
because i don't know what he's going to
 

321
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,730
because i don't know what he's going to
do you understand so we're here in these

the manifestation of the drill being
 

335
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,000
the manifestation of the drill being
fulfilled you're tackling lies so the

00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:55,670
will you put that foot back where it was
 

377
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,930
will you put that foot back where it was
and he will be able to hitch so I'm here

378

and he will be able to hitch so I'm here
he reminds the film and I let him

380
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:04,700
he reminds the film and I let him
 

381
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,790
he reminds the film and I let him
because I don't know where he's going

382
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:06,800
because I don't know where he's going
 

383
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,220
because I don't know where he's going
right I don't know if he's going high I

384
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,230
right I don't know if he's going high I
 

385
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,680
right I don't know if he's going high I
don't know if he's going low so i will

386
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:11,690
don't know if he's going low so i will
 

387
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,320
don't know if he's going low so i will
hold the center line until I figure it

388
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,330
hold the center line until I figure it
 

389
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:35,950

out home

390
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:35,960

 

391
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,130

comes in same kind of thing like he's

400
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
comes in same kind of thing like he's
 

401
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
comes in same kind of thing like he's
pushing on my hand right this is not

402
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:03,770
pushing on my hand right this is not
 

403
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,610
pushing on my hand right this is not
what we're doing he pushes on my hand

404
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,620
what we're doing he pushes on my hand
 

405
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:14,240
what we're doing he pushes on my hand
you let it go dead so he's pushing on my

406
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,250
you let it go dead so he's pushing on my
 

407
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,690
you let it go dead so he's pushing on my
joe i left my Joe go dead but my sander

408
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:17,700
joe i left my Joe go dead but my sander
 

409
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,060
joe i left my Joe go dead but my sander
stays alive because I was ultimately

410
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,070
stays alive because I was ultimately
 

411
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:29,440
stays alive because I was ultimately
related to him not his Joe so we go I

412
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,450
related to him not his Joe so we go I

419
00:19:48,260 --> 00:20:00,409

but when we have a vengeance

420
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:00,419

 

421
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:08,669

I've idea okay so in his category though

422
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:08,679
I've idea okay so in his category though
 

423
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:09,870
I've idea okay so in his category though
it's going to be a point of articulation

424
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:09,880
it's going to be a point of articulation
 

425
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,680
it's going to be a point of articulation
a point I wish to Joe generates a radius

426
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:13,690
a point I wish to Joe generates a radius
 

427
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,350
a point I wish to Joe generates a radius
and now its travels along the circle

428
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,360
and now its travels along the circle
 

429
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,850
and now its travels along the circle
time when I take an angle deviation I'll

430
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:20,860
time when I take an angle deviation I'll
 

431
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,510
time when I take an angle deviation I'll
have to move into his own a sanctuary so

432
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:24,520
have to move into his own a sanctuary so
 

433
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,409
have to move into his own a sanctuary so
that means that I'm going to have my

434
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:28,419
that means that I'm going to have my
 

435
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:31,890
that means that I'm going to have my
circle right taking apex of the circle

436
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:31,900
circle right taking apex of the circle
 

437
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,950
circle right taking apex of the circle
cross square by connecting those a Texas

438
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
cross square by connecting those a Texas
 

439
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,980
cross square by connecting those a Texas
right and then shade in a circle and now

440
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:37,990
right and then shade in a circle and now
 

441
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,930
right and then shade in a circle and now
those corners of the square are not

442
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:39,940
those corners of the square are not
 

443
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,450
those corners of the square are not
shaded in that's where i'm going to move

444
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,460
shaded in that's where i'm going to move
 

445
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,570
shaded in that's where i'm going to move
okay so when i do that second move and I

446
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:45,580
okay so when i do that second move and I
 

447
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,380
okay so when i do that second move and I
come over here I have to stay outside

448
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,390
come over here I have to stay outside
 

449
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,940
come over here I have to stay outside
the radius of his weapon if i go here

450
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:55,950
the radius of his weapon if i go here
 

451
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,360
the radius of his weapon if i go here
then here i moved inside the radius of

452
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,370
then here i moved inside the radius of
 

453
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,230
then here i moved inside the radius of
his way okay and I don't have an angle

454
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
his way okay and I don't have an angle
 

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,690
his way okay and I don't have an angle
of daeviation to be redundant with my

456
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:06,700
of daeviation to be redundant with my
 

457
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,430
of daeviation to be redundant with my
angle of deflection and we've got that

458
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,440
angle of deflection and we've got that
 

459
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,850
angle of deflection and we've got that
also I moved into the effective range of

460
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:17,860
also I moved into the effective range of
 

461
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,770
also I moved into the effective range of
his power so even if I wore to deflect

462
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:22,780
his power so even if I wore to deflect
 

463
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,860
his power so even if I wore to deflect
it right is probably going to overpower

464
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:25,870
it right is probably going to overpower
 

465
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,080
it right is probably going to overpower
my block anyways should thank you go

466
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,090
my block anyways should thank you go
 

467
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,820
my block anyways should thank you go
back

468
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:34,830

 

469
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:42,330

so we have the US so I go one okay there

470
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,340
so we have the US so I go one okay there
 

471
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,600
so we have the US so I go one okay there
there is the radius say they're see it

472
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:50,610

 

473
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,810

now my goal was to stay outside of it

474
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:56,820
now my goal was to stay outside of it
 

475
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:04,290
now my goal was to stay outside of it
and regain the center line okay oh but

476
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,300
and regain the center line okay oh but
 

477
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,830
and regain the center line okay oh but
if I put my right foot where the radius

478
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
if I put my right foot where the radius
 

479
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,320
if I put my right foot where the radius
is the end of it and now step in okay

480
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,330
is the end of it and now step in okay
 

481
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,760
is the end of it and now step in okay
you're on the center line aren't you

the web okay so one my angle deviation

486
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,000
the web okay so one my angle deviation
 

487
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,360
the web okay so one my angle deviation
is not redundant with my angle of

is not redundant with my angle of
 

489
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,640
is not redundant with my angle of
deflection I'm all dependent on my angle

but two we're here we're here there's

492
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:38,830
but two we're here we're here there's
 

493

not much on this make you strong there's

494
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,070
not much on this make you strong there's
 

495
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,920
not much on this make you strong there's
not much on it as I started getting

496
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:43,930
not much on it as I started getting
 

497
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,670
not much on it as I started getting
closer don't let me see and you can go

498
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:47,680
closer don't let me see and you can go
 

499
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,700
closer don't let me see and you can go
to the extreme to test page one hundred

500
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:50,710
to the extreme to test page one hundred
 

501
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,460
to the extreme to test page one hundred
percent wrong so the closer that I'm

502
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,470
percent wrong so the closer that I'm
 

503
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,800
percent wrong so the closer that I'm
getting to his hands the closer on

504
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:55,810
getting to his hands the closer on
 

505
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,610
getting to his hands the closer on
getting to the axis the more powerful

506
00:22:59,610 --> 00:22:59,620
getting to the axis the more powerful
 

507
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:06,390
getting to the axis the more powerful
he's getting so if we switch roles okay

508
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
he's getting so if we switch roles okay
 

509
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,330
he's getting so if we switch roles okay
so there you are right and now move in

510
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,340
so there you are right and now move in
 

511
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,720
so there you are right and now move in
okay would you say that's he moved in

512
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,730
okay would you say that's he moved in
 

513
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,180
okay would you say that's he moved in
okay

514
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,190

 

515
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,130

have your jovi they target scoot your

516
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,140
have your jovi they target scoot your
 

517
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,919
have your jovi they target scoot your
head out of the way step back just leave

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:24,929
head out of the way step back just leave
 

519
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,680
head out of the way step back just leave
that target back do you understand you

520
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,690
that target back do you understand you
 

521
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,340
that target back do you understand you
guys see where I'm at ok so now that's

522
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,350
guys see where I'm at ok so now that's
 

523
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:40,909
guys see where I'm at ok so now that's
where I was but his head is here well

524
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
where I was but his head is here well
 

525
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,610
where I was but his head is here well
that looked like it was pretty effective

526
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:43,620
that looked like it was pretty effective
 

527
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,149
that looked like it was pretty effective
right if you move closer to his hands

528
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:47,159
right if you move closer to his hands
 

529
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,080
right if you move closer to his hands
where the distal end concept is now

530
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,090
where the distal end concept is now
 

531
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,110
where the distal end concept is now
being used against you I know how that

532
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,120
being used against you I know how that
 

533
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,210
being used against you I know how that
this way I'm going to go close to its

534
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,220
this way I'm going to go close to its
 

535
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,860
this way I'm going to go close to its
next step ok so as you move up the

536
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:00,870
next step ok so as you move up the
 

537
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,180
next step ok so as you move up the
radius cannot have your right foot go to

538
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,190
radius cannot have your right foot go to
 

539
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,669
radius cannot have your right foot go to
the end of the radius because your left

540
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
the end of the radius because your left
 

541
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,600
the end of the radius because your left
foot is now going to move inside ok or

542
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,610
foot is now going to move inside ok or
 

543
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,210
foot is now going to move inside ok or
you could do this but now you have no

544
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,220
you could do this but now you have no
 

545
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,879
you could do this but now you have no
base almost 2 flex your spine to

546
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:16,889
base almost 2 flex your spine to
 

547
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,110
base almost 2 flex your spine to
generate the power ok so you have to

548
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
generate the power ok so you have to
 

549
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,299
generate the power ok so you have to
make room for your left foot and it's

550
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:23,309
make room for your left foot and it's
 

551
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,519
make room for your left foot and it's
going to go out and your left foot has

552
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:25,529
going to go out and your left foot has
 

553
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,879
going to go out and your left foot has
to go to the end of the radius come back

554
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:28,889
to go to the end of the radius come back
 

555
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:35,299
to go to the end of the radius come back
so we go I see and my left foot goes to

556
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:35,309
so we go I see and my left foot goes to
 

557
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,990
so we go I see and my left foot goes to
the end of the radius ok all right let's

558
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,000
the end of the radius ok all right let's
 

559
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,190
the end of the radius ok all right let's
try see you remember the radius right

560
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
try see you remember the radius right
 

561
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,320
try see you remember the radius right
little plot points of the jail so he

562
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,330
little plot points of the jail so he
 

563
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:52,070
little plot points of the jail so he
school I'm fighting right yes ok as he

564
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
school I'm fighting right yes ok as he
 

565
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,149
school I'm fighting right yes ok as he
goes I'm looking at him so now keep that

566
00:24:59,149 --> 00:24:59,159
goes I'm looking at him so now keep that
 

567
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,669
goes I'm looking at him so now keep that
in mind and remember the clock arms

568
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
in mind and remember the clock arms
 

569
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,430
in mind and remember the clock arms
radius lysates about there

570
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,440
radius lysates about there
 

571
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,749
radius lysates about there
if I go like this was my Center pointed

572
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:11,759
if I go like this was my Center pointed
 

573
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,349
if I go like this was my Center pointed
at him is it pointing it no it's not all

574
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:15,359
at him is it pointing it no it's not all
 

575
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,149
at him is it pointing it no it's not all
right so I go like it's 20 to him but

576
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
right so I go like it's 20 to him but
 

577
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,950
right so I go like it's 20 to him but
what's the whole know so when you travel

578
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
what's the whole know so when you travel
 

579
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,739
what's the whole know so when you travel
up the radius you just like you have

580
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:27,749
up the radius you just like you have
 

581
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:30,019
up the radius you just like you have
your your rifle you would have pointed

582
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:30,029
your your rifle you would have pointed
 

583
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,609
your your rifle you would have pointed
at him you're not going to move up the

584
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:34,619
at him you're not going to move up the
 

585
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,830
at him you're not going to move up the
radius like that so if you watch my hips

586
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
radius like that so if you watch my hips
 

587
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,310
radius like that so if you watch my hips
now you're going to see that on my point

588
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
now you're going to see that on my point
 

589
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,529
now you're going to see that on my point
there's actually a hip rotation so I'm

590
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:45,539
there's actually a hip rotation so I'm
 

591
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,180
there's actually a hip rotation so I'm
going to be long gate the front of my

592
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,190
going to be long gate the front of my
 

593
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,759
going to be long gate the front of my
pelvis here and this Joe is going to

594
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:49,769
pelvis here and this Joe is going to
 

595
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:54,799
pelvis here and this Joe is going to
rotate as I go see I to dot so we go

596
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:54,809
rotate as I go see I to dot so we go
 

597
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:04,200
rotate as I go see I to dot so we go
watch for that movement 10

598
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,210

 

599
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,780

so I'm looking at him and I was looking

600
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:07,790
so I'm looking at him and I was looking
 

601
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,560
so I'm looking at him and I was looking
at him the entire time be careful in the

602
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:11,570
at him the entire time be careful in the
 

603
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,610
at him the entire time be careful in the
same way that you do radius and then in

604
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:15,620
same way that you do radius and then in
 

605
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,730
same way that you do radius and then in
the radius that you're not doing a two

606
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:18,740
the radius that you're not doing a two
 

607
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,520
the radius that you're not doing a two
dimensional linear pattern what are your

608
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,530
dimensional linear pattern what are your
 

609
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,470
dimensional linear pattern what are your
like is it was a second where you want

610
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,480
like is it was a second where you want
 

611
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,350
like is it was a second where you want
okay let's go
