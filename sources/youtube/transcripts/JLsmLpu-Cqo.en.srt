31
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,630
to say that's the eighth Kum Joe
um and that it's very different than

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:31,640
um and that it's very different than
 

33
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,549
um and that it's very different than
cyto Sensei did it um and in the

34
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:33,559
cyto Sensei did it um and in the
 

35
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,549
cyto Sensei did it um and in the
inspiration of all of my Kum Joe come

36
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
inspiration of all of my Kum Joe come
 

37
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,430
inspiration of all of my Kum Joe come
from cyto sense I think they're really

38
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
from cyto sense I think they're really
 

39
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,350
from cyto sense I think they're really
very good um I just kind of don't like

40
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
very good um I just kind of don't like
 

41
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,670
very good um I just kind of don't like
the way they're organized and I think

42
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
the way they're organized and I think
 

43
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,029
the way they're organized and I think
there's a lot of talking points that

44
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:42,039
there's a lot of talking points that
 

45
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,430
there's a lot of talking points that
aren't really hit and there's a lot of

46
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
aren't really hit and there's a lot of
 

47
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,470
aren't really hit and there's a lot of
interesting stuff to talk about so um I

48
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,480
interesting stuff to talk about so um I
 

49
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,150
interesting stuff to talk about so um I
teach them in a different order and talk

50
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
teach them in a different order and talk
 

51
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,990
teach them in a different order and talk
about them in a different way so very

52
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,000
about them in a different way so very
 

53
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,389
about them in a different way so very
similar to scy the sensei's eth Kum Joe

54
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:51,399
similar to scy the sensei's eth Kum Joe
 

55
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,709
similar to scy the sensei's eth Kum Joe

92
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
and and that's not to say I couldn't hop
 

93
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,469

in and do an extra effort to get him but
 

95
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,109

we're looking at effort for effort right
 

97
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:41,950

so when you're when you're trying to

98
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:41,960
so when you're when you're trying to
 

99
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,749
so when you're when you're trying to
figure out any of this stuff you need to

100
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
figure out any of this stuff you need to
 

101
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,149
figure out any of this stuff you need to
think what is my Baseline and what is

102
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
think what is my Baseline and what is
 

103
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,190
think what is my Baseline and what is
their Baseline now can you do over your

104
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200
their Baseline now can you do over your
 

105
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,270
their Baseline now can you do over your
Baseline yes but they can also do over

106
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
Baseline yes but they can also do over
 

107
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,389
Baseline yes but they can also do over
their Baseline so when you're trying to

108
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
their Baseline so when you're trying to
 

109
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,190
their Baseline so when you're trying to
like figure out you know like well I

110
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
like figure out you know like well I
 

111
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,670
like figure out you know like well I
could do this it's like well they could

112
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680
could do this it's like well they could
 

113
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,870
could do this it's like well they could
do something also so what's the Baseline

114
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
do something also so what's the Baseline
 

115
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,590
do something also so what's the Baseline
for this the Baseline for this is in one

116
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
for this the Baseline for this is in one
 

117
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,910
for this the Baseline for this is in one
step I can't get Josh right okay so

118
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
step I can't get Josh right okay so
 

119
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,830
step I can't get Josh right okay so
we're both on each other in this all

120
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
we're both on each other in this all

00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
course I could just take a step in that
 

125
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,229
course I could just take a step in that
preps my action right so I could just

126
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
preps my action right so I could just
 

127
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,470
preps my action right so I could just
come in here and now I'm in but I gave

come in here and now I'm in but I gave
 

129
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,949
come in here and now I'm in but I gave
him a lot of notification about what's

130
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:15,959
him a lot of notification about what's
 

131
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,390
him a lot of notification about what's
going on I gave him a lot of time to

132
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
going on I gave him a lot of time to
 

133
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,750
going on I gave him a lot of time to
adapt to whatever I'm going to do I did

134
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
adapt to whatever I'm going to do I did
 

135
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,229
adapt to whatever I'm going to do I did
an action that really doesn't do

136
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
an action that really doesn't do
 

137
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,190
an action that really doesn't do
anything besides set my distance right

138
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,200
anything besides set my distance right
 

139
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,270
anything besides set my distance right
doesn't give him anything he has to

140
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
doesn't give him anything he has to
 

141
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,550
doesn't give him anything he has to
worry about which means he can start

142
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
worry about which means he can start
 

143
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,589
worry about which means he can start
calculating what to do for me that gives

144
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:26,599

calculating what to do for me that gives
him an advantage I don't want to have

146
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,910
come in here and pop him now because of
the advantage of the Kamai of kin Kamai

158
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
the advantage of the Kamai of kin Kamai
 

159
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,390
the advantage of the Kamai of kin Kamai
versus the disadvantage in jooki then I

160
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
versus the disadvantage in jooki then I
 

161
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,229
versus the disadvantage in jooki then I
have this reach Advantage right so

162
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
have this reach Advantage right so
 

163
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,430
have this reach Advantage right so
meaning when we go like this if I'm

164
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,440
meaning when we go like this if I'm
 

165
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,790
meaning when we go like this if I'm
popping Josh and he comes to thrust me

166
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
popping Josh and he comes to thrust me
 

167
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,390
popping Josh and he comes to thrust me
he can't get me right even when he leans

168
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
he can't get me right even when he leans
 

169
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,990
he can't get me right even when he leans
in like that right so he still can't

170
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
in like that right so he still can't
 

171
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,630
in like that right so he still can't
quite get me so what you're looking for

172
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
quite get me so what you're looking for
 

173
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,390
quite get me so what you're looking for
is a way that I can make an advantage

174
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,400
is a way that I can make an advantage
 

175
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,110
is a way that I can make an advantage
once I'm in position so not just am I

176
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
once I'm in position so not just am I
 

177
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,830
once I'm in position so not just am I
getting to the distance I I need to get

178
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
getting to the distance I I need to get
 

179
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,390
getting to the distance I I need to get
into and not I'm just hitting him which

180
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
into and not I'm just hitting him which
 

181
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,949
into and not I'm just hitting him which
is great because that makes him react to

182
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
is great because that makes him react to
 

183
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,270
is great because that makes him react to
me but also I've accounted for my

184
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
me but also I've accounted for my
 

185
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,949
me but also I've accounted for my
secondary position which is really

186
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:15,959
secondary position which is really
 

187
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,149
secondary position which is really
really good so it's a great idea to

188
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
really good so it's a great idea to
 

189
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,430
really good so it's a great idea to
attack someone right and if this guy's

190
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
attack someone right and if this guy's
 

191
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,110
attack someone right and if this guy's
not very good I'm probably just going to

192
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
not very good I'm probably just going to
 

193
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,350
not very good I'm probably just going to
pop him he's not going to have a

194
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,360
pop him he's not going to have a
 

195
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,869
pop him he's not going to have a
response to that and it's going to be

196
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
response to that and it's going to be
 

197
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,430
response to that and it's going to be
really excellent for me okay now if he's

198
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
really excellent for me okay now if he's
 

199
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,509
really excellent for me okay now if he's
aware of this he can take advantage of

200
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:30,519
aware of this he can take advantage of
 

201
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,110
aware of this he can take advantage of
the fact that I have to still move

202
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
the fact that I have to still move
 

203
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,350
the fact that I have to still move
through this distance to get him right

204
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
through this distance to get him right
 

205
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,190
through this distance to get him right
so there is still a time where I'm

206
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
so there is still a time where I'm
 

207
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,470
so there is still a time where I'm
moving and I'm not striking exactly

208
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,480
moving and I'm not striking exactly
 

209
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,030
moving and I'm not striking exactly
during that time because I can't do the

210
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
during that time because I can't do the
 

211
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,070
during that time because I can't do the
simplest most efficient strike at this

212
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
simplest most efficient strike at this
 

213
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,710
simplest most efficient strike at this
distance so what he's going to do is

214
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,720
distance so what he's going to do is
 

215
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,470
distance so what he's going to do is
he's going to come in and hit me boom

216
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
he's going to come in and hit me boom
 

217
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,350
he's going to come in and hit me boom
okay so he's taking advantage of the

218
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360
okay so he's taking advantage of the
 

219
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,750
okay so he's taking advantage of the
fact that my actions compound right so I

220
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:52,760
fact that my actions compound right so I
 

221
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,030
fact that my actions compound right so I
got to go up turn it over and hit him

222
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
got to go up turn it over and hit him
 

223
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,309
got to go up turn it over and hit him
jodan guch and he can just step in and I

224
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
jodan guch and he can just step in and I
 

225
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,830
jodan guch and he can just step in and I
am still stepping in so he's going to

226
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
am still stepping in so he's going to
 

227
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,110
am still stepping in so he's going to
meet me halfway so when I come in boom

228
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,120
meet me halfway so when I come in boom
 

229
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,789
meet me halfway so when I come in boom
he gets me there okay now the problem

230
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:03,799
he gets me there okay now the problem
 

231
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:06,030
he gets me there okay now the problem
for him here is he's got no protection

232
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,040
for him here is he's got no protection
 

233
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,149
for him here is he's got no protection
for his head so if I come down bang I'll

234
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
for his head so if I come down bang I'll
 

235
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,110
for his head so if I come down bang I'll
I'll hit him so he'll hit me cool but he

236
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,120
I'll hit him so he'll hit me cool but he
 

237
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,750
I'll hit him so he'll hit me cool but he
hasn't accounted for a second position

238
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
hasn't accounted for a second position
 

239
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,429
hasn't accounted for a second position
in this so that's not exactly a great

240
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
in this so that's not exactly a great
 

241
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,110
in this so that's not exactly a great
move right however because of hand in

242
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,120
move right however because of hand in
 

243
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,830
move right however because of hand in
hand speed if he brings his hands up as

244
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:18,840
hand speed if he brings his hands up as
 

245
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,870
hand speed if he brings his hands up as
I bring my hands down he'll still be

246
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
I bring my hands down he'll still be
 

247
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,710
I bring my hands down he'll still be
able to defend himself right so across

248
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:23,720
able to defend himself right so across
 

249
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,230
able to defend himself right so across
the board when I teach all my weapons

250
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,240
the board when I teach all my weapons
 

251
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,270
the board when I teach all my weapons
form stuff this number one idea is how

252
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,280
form stuff this number one idea is how
 

253
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,790
form stuff this number one idea is how
to deal with a low attack and manage a

254
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
to deal with a low attack and manage a
 

255
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,189
to deal with a low attack and manage a
high attack at the same time so this

256
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,199
high attack at the same time so this
 

257
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,230
high attack at the same time so this
bits also my number one with the sword

258
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
bits also my number one with the sword
 

259
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
bits also my number one with the sword
my number one with everything else so as

260
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
my number one with everything else so as
 

261
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,469
my number one with everything else so as
I come in up high he hits me bang like

262
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
I come in up high he hits me bang like
 

263
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,830
I come in up high he hits me bang like
this okay now hand forand action as I

264
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
this okay now hand forand action as I
 

265
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,029
this okay now hand forand action as I
come down he can protect his head so

266
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:44,039
come down he can protect his head so
 

267
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,230
come down he can protect his head so
we've got a nice counter for him he can

268
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
we've got a nice counter for him he can
 

269
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,310
we've got a nice counter for him he can
attack me and defend himself however if

270
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
attack me and defend himself however if
 

271
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,230
attack me and defend himself however if
he can steal a little time meaning he's

272
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,240
he can steal a little time meaning he's
 

273
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,029
he can steal a little time meaning he's
a little faster he can do even more with

274
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,039
a little faster he can do even more with
 

275
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,310
a little faster he can do even more with
this so meaning as he hits me he's going

276
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,320
this so meaning as he hits me he's going
 

277
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,830
this so meaning as he hits me he's going
to immediately start stepping off line

278
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:58,840
to immediately start stepping off line
 

279
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,270
to immediately start stepping off line
in my last little bit of a step and he's

280
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,280
in my last little bit of a step and he's
 

281
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,270
in my last little bit of a step and he's
going to then hit me again bang so he's

282
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
going to then hit me again bang so he's
 

283
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,710
going to then hit me again bang so he's
hit me twice now now my reaction would

284
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
hit me twice now now my reaction would
 

285
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,510
hit me twice now now my reaction would
be to come to his legs so what he's

286
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
be to come to his legs so what he's
 

287
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,070
be to come to his legs so what he's
going to do is slide that stick in

288
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
going to do is slide that stick in
 

289
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,189
going to do is slide that stick in
between my hands and now I can't get to

290
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,199
between my hands and now I can't get to
 

291
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,350
between my hands and now I can't get to
his legs with any kind of power right

292
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
his legs with any kind of power right
 

293
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,189
his legs with any kind of power right
well what's my idea my idea is I have to

294
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:14,199
well what's my idea my idea is I have to
 

295
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,070
well what's my idea my idea is I have to
clear this weapon somehow how am I going

296
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
clear this weapon somehow how am I going
 

297
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,590
clear this weapon somehow how am I going
to do that I'm going to pull it free

298
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
to do that I'm going to pull it free
 

299
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,590
to do that I'm going to pull it free
like this okay now if as I go to pull it

300
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:20,600
like this okay now if as I go to pull it
 

301
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,430
like this okay now if as I go to pull it
free he sticks right with me he's going

302
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
free he sticks right with me he's going
 

303
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,670
free he sticks right with me he's going
to bind my arms up and toss me away and

304
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:24,680
to bind my arms up and toss me away and
 

305
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,510
to bind my arms up and toss me away and
so we get the full form in this right

306
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
so we get the full form in this right
 

307
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,950
so we get the full form in this right
okay so initially our big first idea is

308
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:29,960
okay so initially our big first idea is
 

309
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,710
okay so initially our big first idea is
how do I cover that distance in a clever

310
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,720
how do I cover that distance in a clever
 

311
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,670
how do I cover that distance in a clever

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
way it's a clever way he just happens to
 

313
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,110
way it's a clever way he just happens to
be a little better than me right so as I

314
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
be a little better than me right so as I
 

315
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,070
be a little better than me right so as I

320
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
he catches my hand so I can't come in
 

321
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,070

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
brings me over now there's a ton of
 

327
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,629
brings me over now there's a ton of
other little things that could happen in

328
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
other little things that could happen in
 

329
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,230
other little things that could happen in
this but those are all already accounted

330
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,240
this but those are all already accounted
 

331
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,909
this but those are all already accounted
for in the way this is built and the

332
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:54,919
for in the way this is built and the
 

333
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,629
for in the way this is built and the
ones that don't account for it will be

334
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
ones that don't account for it will be
 

335
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,830
ones that don't account for it will be
accounted for in the second form so

336
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
accounted for in the second form so
 

337
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,189
accounted for in the second form so
there's 10 of these these forms they all

338
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:00,199
there's 10 of these these forms they all
 

339
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,629
there's 10 of these these forms they all
just answer questions that the other

340
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:01,639
just answer questions that the other
 

341
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,909
just answer questions that the other
ones pose but let's look at one big

342
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
ones pose but let's look at one big
 

343
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,110
ones pose but let's look at one big
obvious one right so as I come in he

344
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,120
obvious one right so as I come in he
 

345
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,150
obvious one right so as I come in he
hits me bang I come down he gets offline

346
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
hits me bang I come down he gets offline
 

347
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,350
hits me bang I come down he gets offline
he's protect his head and that whole

348
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
he's protect his head and that whole
 

349
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,469
he's protect his head and that whole
nine yards all right now when I go to

350
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:11,479
nine yards all right now when I go to
 

351
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,790
nine yards all right now when I go to
hit him here let's say I'm a little

352
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:13,800
hit him here let's say I'm a little
 

353
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,830
hit him here let's say I'm a little
faster if I'm a little faster and I go

354
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
faster if I'm a little faster and I go
 

355
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,189
faster if I'm a little faster and I go
to hit him he's already in banino Kamai

356
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:18,199
to hit him he's already in banino Kamai
 

357
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,510
to hit him he's already in banino Kamai
so he's already defended and because

358
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
so he's already defended and because
 

359
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,390
so he's already defended and because
it's banin noai he can defend all the

360
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,400
it's banin noai he can defend all the
 

361
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,950
it's banin noai he can defend all the
way to his leg so if I came down to his

362
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
way to his leg so if I came down to his
 

363
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,909
way to his leg so if I came down to his
knee he's still defended his knee so

364
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:24,919
knee he's still defended his knee so
 

365
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,550
knee he's still defended his knee so
while he's getting off line he's still

366
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
while he's getting off line he's still
 

367
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,430
while he's getting off line he's still
in a defended position so if I'm faster

368
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,440
in a defended position so if I'm faster
 

369
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,830
in a defended position so if I'm faster
it doesn't matter it doesn't turn out as

370
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
it doesn't matter it doesn't turn out as
 

371
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,749
it doesn't matter it doesn't turn out as
well for him because I'm quicker but

372
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:32,759
well for him because I'm quicker but
 

373
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,550
well for him because I'm quicker but
he's still protected the whole time okay

374
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
he's still protected the whole time okay
 

375
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,309
he's still protected the whole time okay
now once he catches in here and he

376
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
now once he catches in here and he
 

377
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,710

379
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,749
Tangles up my arms could I just let go
with this hand because the problem is

380
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
with this hand because the problem is
 

381
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,909
with this hand because the problem is
this hand can't go in towards him

382
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:40,919
this hand can't go in towards him
 

383
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,110
this hand can't go in towards him
because he's locked this hand in place

384
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,120
because he's locked this hand in place
 

385
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,150
because he's locked this hand in place
so I can't can't get into him right

386
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
so I can't can't get into him right
 

387

391
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,790

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:49,800
right so I I could probably line up and
 

393
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,230
