there's one spiral go

there's one spiral go
 

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,690
there's one spiral go
and then you came into the uh shikaku in

and then you came into the uh shikaku in
 

69
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,970
and then you came into the uh shikaku in
the back and basically you're just going

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,970

to accelerate her backwards go ahead

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,210

so that's not the pattern I did but we

76
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
so that's not the pattern I did but we
 

77
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,770
so that's not the pattern I did but we
kind of do that pattern but not like

kind of do that pattern but not like
 

79
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,130

that okay so show you
