the
points so what I'd like you to do is I'd
like you to speak out loud um we'll say
um first where it doesn't feel right you
I mean so if you sort of just keep it
brief and just s of say you know I feel
stuck here or feel heavy or too much
weight on the wrong foot or you know
whatever comes it you know even without
you thinking you know yeah okay
that was
wobbly what happened
there wasn't straight for
so that was
better I've got a r of thumb and said if
you do something five times you can make
three of them feel good then you you
almost reach your best
