1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,510

okay so for the tyo W this way first

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:04,520
okay so for the tyo W this way first
 

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,509
okay so for the tyo W this way first
always this

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:07,519

 

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,990

way don't come

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
way don't come
 

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,390
way don't come
out this isn't enough either

8
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
out this isn't enough either
 

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,750
out this isn't enough either
down okay rotates

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
down okay rotates
 

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,590
down okay rotates
in so let's just look at that elbow part

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600
in so let's just look at that elbow part
 

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,349
in so let's just look at that elbow part
first elbow part here H that

14
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:24,359
first elbow part here H that
 

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,630
first elbow part here H that
turn Okay so just pay attention to that

16
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:27,640
turn Okay so just pay attention to that
 

17
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,109
turn Okay so just pay attention to that
as I do the whole technique

18
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
as I do the whole technique
 

19
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,709
as I do the whole technique
you're just looking at the elbow part

20
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:33,719
you're just looking at the elbow part
 

21
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,549
you're just looking at the elbow part
elbow

22
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
elbow
 

23
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,470
elbow
part all right next

24
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
part all right next
 

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,510
part all right next
part elbow is in don't just open this up

26
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
part elbow is in don't just open this up
 

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,229
part elbow is in don't just open this up
and try to walk under

28
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239

 

29
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,910

this because we're even here I'm at the

30
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
this because we're even here I'm at the
 

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,389
this because we're even here I'm at the
distal end of my

32
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:55,399
distal end of my
 

33
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,150
distal end of my
lever and I'm at the distal end of his

34
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
lever and I'm at the distal end of his
 

35
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,750
lever and I'm at the distal end of his
lever only he's on top top okay so he

36
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
lever only he's on top top okay so he
 

37
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,590
lever only he's on top top okay so he
gets to use his lat uh as well as his

38
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
gets to use his lat uh as well as his
 

39
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,870
gets to use his lat uh as well as his
deltoid and this lat and the other back

40
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:07,880
deltoid and this lat and the other back
 

41
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,830
deltoid and this lat and the other back
muscles is going to overpower my outer

42
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
muscles is going to overpower my outer
 

43
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,230
muscles is going to overpower my outer
or upper deltoid here don't hurt me just

44
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,240
or upper deltoid here don't hurt me just
 

45
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,270
or upper deltoid here don't hurt me just
push down and I can't do anything

46
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
push down and I can't do anything
 

47
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,190
push down and I can't do anything
okay so elbows in this goes this

48
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200

 

49
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,749

way if you watch his grip youve brought

50
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:28,759
way if you watch his grip youve brought
 

51
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,870
way if you watch his grip youve brought
his grip you see

52
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
his grip you see
 

53
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,109
his grip you see
it's not on top

54
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
it's not on top
 

55
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,310
it's not on top
anymore plus you've dis uh placed his

56
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
anymore plus you've dis uh placed his
 

57
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,550
anymore plus you've dis uh placed his
balance his posture plus Energy's going

58
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
balance his posture plus Energy's going
 

59
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,830
balance his posture plus Energy's going
that way making it a little harder to

60
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
that way making it a little harder to
 

61
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,870
that way making it a little harder to
push down

62
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
push down
 

63
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,670
push down
okay so in

64
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:48,680
okay so in
 

65
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,469
okay so in
boom just exaggerate that now we already

66
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
boom just exaggerate that now we already
 

67
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,029
boom just exaggerate that now we already
came over the elbow this way

68
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039

 

69
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,230

boom boom

70
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,240
boom boom
 

71
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,230
boom boom
all right last key point is you even if

72
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,240
all right last key point is you even if
 

73
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,510
all right last key point is you even if
you were doing that you don't ever want

74
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
you were doing that you don't ever want
 

75
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,830
you were doing that you don't ever want
your hand out

76
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:10,840
your hand out
 

77
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,229
your hand out
there okay because he's strong

78
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
there okay because he's strong
 

79
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,710
there okay because he's strong
enough he can still do it on me he's

80
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
enough he can still do it on me he's
 

81
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,750
enough he can still do it on me he's
much stronger than me okay so you're

82
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
much stronger than me okay so you're
 

83
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,550
much stronger than me okay so you're
timing you have to bring your body with

84
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,560
timing you have to bring your body with
 

85
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,750
timing you have to bring your body with
your

86
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
your
 

87
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,470
your
hand instead of staying here you do your

88
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
hand instead of staying here you do your
 

89
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,390
hand instead of staying here you do your
hand and then you walk through you're

90
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
hand and then you walk through you're
 

91
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,869
hand and then you walk through you're
never going to get there

92
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
never going to get there
 

93
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,910
never going to get there
your whole body moves with your hand so

94
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
your whole body moves with your hand so
 

95
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,830
your whole body moves with your hand so
then you have your frame underneath you

96
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:38,840
then you have your frame underneath you
 

97
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,949
then you have your frame underneath you
here here okay so if you guys

98
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:43,959
here here okay so if you guys
 

99
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,430
here here okay so if you guys
recognize that upper block you see we

100
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
recognize that upper block you see we
 

101
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,190
recognize that upper block you see we
use this all this spiral all the time oh

102
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
use this all this spiral all the time oh
 

103
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,790
use this all this spiral all the time oh
we use this all the time you're using it

104
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
we use this all the time you're using it
 

105
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,430
we use this all the time you're using it
here again okay so R I'm I move with

106
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
here again okay so R I'm I move with
 

107
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,110
here again okay so R I'm I move with
soon as my hand is up that upper block

108
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,120
soon as my hand is up that upper block
 

109
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:21,869
soon as my hand is up that upper block
is there my body is underneath

110
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:21,879

 

111
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,229

it okay put it

112
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:25,239
it okay put it
 

113
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,830
it okay put it
together uh you got to time your grip

114
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840

 

115
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,630

with his intention so you have to end up

116
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
with his intention so you have to end up
 

117
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,710
with his intention so you have to end up
here you don't want to try I to tie so

118
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
here you don't want to try I to tie so
 

119
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,470

123
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,110
grip okay so that's the first thing to
pay attention to it comes in boom I

124
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
pay attention to it comes in boom I
 

125
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,750
pay attention to it comes in boom I
don't do it beforehand so it'll end up

126
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,760
don't do it beforehand so it'll end up
 

127
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,190
don't do it beforehand so it'll end up
on top I want to end up

sideways
 

131
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,390
sideways
okay then of course you have your Fades

132
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
okay then of course you have your Fades
 

133
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,830
okay then of course you have your Fades
so you can do it with a weight shift

134
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
so you can do it with a weight shift
 

135
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,390
so you can do it with a weight shift
depends how fast he's coming in you can

136
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
depends how fast he's coming in you can
 

137
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,830
depends how fast he's coming in you can
do it with a f with a movement

138
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:06,840
do it with a f with a movement
 

139
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,670
do it with a f with a movement
okay here and a fade okay then you have

140
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680
okay here and a fade okay then you have
 

141
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,069
okay here and a fade okay then you have
a inward spiral

142
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:15,079
a inward spiral
 

143
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,430
a inward spiral
again don't start doing inward Parry

144
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:18,440
again don't start doing inward Parry
 

145
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,909
again don't start doing inward Parry
from some different art you're not doing

146
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:20,919
from some different art you're not doing
 

147
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,790
from some different art you're not doing
that you're trying to get rid of

148
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
that you're trying to get rid of
 

149
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,590
that you're trying to get rid of
utilizing that inner deltoid so you're

150
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
utilizing that inner deltoid so you're
 

151
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,590
utilizing that inner deltoid so you're
here and you only have your inward

152
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
here and you only have your inward
 

153
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,710
here and you only have your inward
spiral but what you're going to do is

154
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720
spiral but what you're going to do is
 

155
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,150
spiral but what you're going to do is
your edb1 con is going to be in

156
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,160
your edb1 con is going to be in
 

157
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,629
your edb1 con is going to be in
communion with that where I will stop

158
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
communion with that where I will stop
 

159
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,749
communion with that where I will stop
the the inward

160
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
the the inward
 

161
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,590
the the inward
spiral and then open it and you're now

162
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600
spiral and then open it and you're now
 

163
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,350
spiral and then open it and you're now
in the completion of uai okay what I'm

164
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
in the completion of uai okay what I'm
 

165
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:58,550
in the completion of uai okay what I'm
trying to avoid is the inner deltoid

166
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560

 

167
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,590
