00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,110
so my first yin yang is up
okay

parallel to him
 

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,750
parallel to him
so when i start to rotate

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
so when i start to rotate
 

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,350
so when i start to rotate
i'm going to have to pull him so this i

62
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
i'm going to have to pull him so this i
 

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,390
i'm going to have to pull him so this i
grab a hold and i go here

grab a hold and i go here
 

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,990
grab a hold and i go here
and then i pull that is a clash two

66
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
and then i pull that is a clash two
 

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,390
and then i pull that is a clash two
it's just an inverse splash his energy

68
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
it's just an inverse splash his energy
 

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,589
it's just an inverse splash his energy
is going that way

70
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
is going that way
 

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,110
is going that way
and i'm gonna pull it so we don't want

72
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
and i'm gonna pull it so we don't want
 

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,030
and i'm gonna pull it so we don't want
that

74
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
that
 

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,710
that
next one clear boom i don't

76
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
next one clear boom i don't
 

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,350
next one clear boom i don't
i don't clash i kind of just move his

78
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
i don't clash i kind of just move his
 

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,309
i don't clash i kind of just move his
arm out of the way

80
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
arm out of the way
 

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,229
arm out of the way
like this but that won't take away the

82
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
like this but that won't take away the
 

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,390
like this but that won't take away the
second clash

84
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400

 

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,110

and this is structurally inferior well

86
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
and this is structurally inferior well
 

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,750
and this is structurally inferior well
obviously

88
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
obviously
 

89
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,830
obviously
so what we're going to do instead is go

90
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
so what we're going to do instead is go
 

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,149
so what we're going to do instead is go
when the opening is

92
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
when the opening is
 

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,670
when the opening is
and as i rotate

94
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
and as i rotate
 

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,110
and as i rotate
expose his back boom you see

96
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
expose his back boom you see
 

97
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,790
expose his back boom you see
now when i do my entering

98
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
now when i do my entering
 

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,430
now when i do my entering
i'll be behind him here

100
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440

 

101
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,789

so don't have your hands in

102
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
so don't have your hands in
 

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:56,949
so don't have your hands in
it leave

104
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959

 

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,830

then step around him this way

106
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
then step around him this way
 

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:13,670
then step around him this way
so that the fight rotates

108
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680

 

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,189

this is doable at the top so his energy

110
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
this is doable at the top so his energy
 

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,870
this is doable at the top so his energy
is going in and

112
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
is going in and
 

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,950
is going in and
i extend the yin and then as his yawn

114
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
i extend the yin and then as his yawn
 

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,150
i extend the yin and then as his yawn
comes

116
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
comes
 

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,870
comes
i let it go past me and the and his back

118
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
i let it go past me and the and his back
 

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,350
i let it go past me and the and his back
gets exposed

120
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
gets exposed
 

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,909
gets exposed
so don't move him this way

122
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919

 

123
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,030

extend the yin up and then he finishes

124
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
extend the yin up and then he finishes
 

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:50,790
extend the yin up and then he finishes
and you let it go bye

126
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800

 

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,350

that's what we're working on forget the

128
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
that's what we're working on forget the
 

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,469
that's what we're working on forget the
throw

130
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
throw
 

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:06,790
throw
it's this part follow it up let it go

132
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800

 

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,830

okay once once i get past this

134
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
okay once once i get past this
 

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,230
okay once once i get past this
initial part and i get this to happen

136
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
initial part and i get this to happen
 

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,150
initial part and i get this to happen
now it comes the uh the

138
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
now it comes the uh the
 

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,189
now it comes the uh the
balance breaking part okay

140
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
balance breaking part okay
 

141
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,230
balance breaking part okay
so usually what we want to do is kind of

142
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
so usually what we want to do is kind of
 

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,710
so usually what we want to do is kind of
spin

144
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
spin
 

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,590
spin
him that's fine for a cooperative

146
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
him that's fine for a cooperative
 

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,590
him that's fine for a cooperative
bouquet

148
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
bouquet
 

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,909
bouquet
first cooperative aspect is that he

150
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
first cooperative aspect is that he
 

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,870
first cooperative aspect is that he
waits there

152
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
waits there
 

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,350
waits there
go ahead he's waiting there you see he's

154
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
go ahead he's waiting there you see he's
 

155
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,990
go ahead he's waiting there you see he's
waiting there

156
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
waiting there
 

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,990
waiting there
for me to do

158
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000

 

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,110

second cooperative aspect is

160
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
second cooperative aspect is
 

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,510
second cooperative aspect is
that he's perfectly balanced

162
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
that he's perfectly balanced
 

163
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,390
that he's perfectly balanced
and this can be resisted resisting

164
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400

 

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,909

of course i could overcome his

166
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
of course i could overcome his
 

167
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,070
of course i could overcome his
resistance but that is not

168
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
resistance but that is not
 

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,749
resistance but that is not
jujitsu hence it's not aikido

170
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
jujitsu hence it's not aikido
 

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,590
jujitsu hence it's not aikido
okay so what we're going to do is

172
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
okay so what we're going to do is
 

173
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,150
okay so what we're going to do is
he's going to finish his strike that

174
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
he's going to finish his strike that
 

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,110
he's going to finish his strike that
energy

176
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
energy
 

177
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,590
energy
is the only energy i have to work with

178
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
is the only energy i have to work with
 

179
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,629
is the only energy i have to work with
which is why

180
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
which is why
 

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,110
which is why
i can't have him weight and i don't want

182
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
i can't have him weight and i don't want
 

183
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,550
i can't have him weight and i don't want
him to wait

184
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
him to wait
 

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,150
him to wait
so just come up he's

186
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
so just come up he's
 

187
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,189
so just come up he's
going to finish this at an angle but i'm

188
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
going to finish this at an angle but i'm
 

189
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,629
going to finish this at an angle but i'm
going to

190
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
going to
 

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,029
going to
have his corner right here start to come

192
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
have his corner right here start to come
 

193
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,590
have his corner right here start to come
and stay still do you see like this

194
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
and stay still do you see like this
 

195
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,790
and stay still do you see like this
this is very much it is

196
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
this is very much it is
 

197
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,830
this is very much it is
like kokoho so he's going to come in

198
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
like kokoho so he's going to come in
 

199
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,710
like kokoho so he's going to come in
and i'm going to keep his head still i'm

200
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
and i'm going to keep his head still i'm
 

201
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,309
and i'm going to keep his head still i'm
just keeping his head still he

202
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
just keeping his head still he
 

203
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,390
just keeping his head still he
give me nugget from here okay

204
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400

 

205
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,790

when i keep his head still though i'm

206
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
when i keep his head still though i'm
 

207
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,230
when i keep his head still though i'm
not going to do it

208
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
not going to do it
 

209
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,510
not going to do it
with reverse

210
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520

 

211
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,710

i'm going to use the centripetal

212
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
i'm going to use the centripetal
 

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,790
i'm going to use the centripetal
energy of the tencon which will mimic

214
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
energy of the tencon which will mimic
 

215
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,950
energy of the tencon which will mimic
an anchor point on that head but it will

216
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
an anchor point on that head but it will
 

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,629
an anchor point on that head but it will
be a dynamic one

218
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
be a dynamic one
 

219
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,350
be a dynamic one
one that continually can continually

220
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
one that continually can continually
 

221
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,309
one that continually can continually
move

222
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
move
 

223
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,110
move
up the radius as he continues to lose

224
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
up the radius as he continues to lose
 

225
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,309
up the radius as he continues to lose
his balance

226
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
his balance
 

227
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,309
his balance
so he is here whoa like this

228
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319

 

229
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,670

this is why i'm not pulling on this key

230
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680

 

231
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,870

i just keep it going

232
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880

 

233
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,029

this is also why the other arm can stay

234
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
this is also why the other arm can stay
 

235
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,150
this is also why the other arm can stay
in its guard position

236
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
in its guard position
 

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,150
in its guard position
and doesn't have to be used like this

238
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160

 

239
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,550

so i read

240
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560

 

241
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,749

and keep that thing ever so

242
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
and keep that thing ever so
 

243
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,029
and keep that thing ever so
on the positive the young side

244
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
on the positive the young side
 

245
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,589
on the positive the young side
of the centripetal energy which is going

246
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
of the centripetal energy which is going
 

247
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,629
of the centripetal energy which is going
to anchor

248
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
to anchor
 

249
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,749
to anchor
this point as it continues to go forward

250
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
this point as it continues to go forward
 

251
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,950
this point as it continues to go forward
okay that's what we're trying to do

252
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
okay that's what we're trying to do
 

253
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,430
okay that's what we're trying to do
now that i'm actually harmonizing yin

254
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
now that i'm actually harmonizing yin
 

255
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,309
now that i'm actually harmonizing yin
and young

256
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
and young
 

257
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,469
and young
and this hand can be doing something

258
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
and this hand can be doing something
 

259
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,510
and this hand can be doing something
else

260
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
else
 

261
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,990
else
the ten con is doing something else too

262
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
the ten con is doing something else too
 

263
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,110
the ten con is doing something else too
the ten con

264
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
the ten con
 

265
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,790
the ten con
is not a matter of me uh using

266
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
is not a matter of me uh using
 

267
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,189
is not a matter of me uh using
a kind of shot-putting technique to take

268
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
a kind of shot-putting technique to take
 

269
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,990
a kind of shot-putting technique to take
his balance

270
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
his balance
 

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,550
his balance
it's me just staying behind him in the

272
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
it's me just staying behind him in the
 

273
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,350
it's me just staying behind him in the
fight

274
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
fight
 

275
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,990
fight
it is staying with him though my tencon

276
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
it is staying with him though my tencon
 

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,589
it is staying with him though my tencon
is governed by him

278
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
is governed by him
 

279
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,389
is governed by him
and the ik adhesion that i have on my

280
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
and the ik adhesion that i have on my
 

281
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,269
and the ik adhesion that i have on my
hand here so for example

282
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
hand here so for example
 

283
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,990
hand here so for example
this is too close this is too far

284
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
this is too close this is too far
 

285
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,790
this is too close this is too far
i use my hand to measure where i'm going

286
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
i use my hand to measure where i'm going
 

287
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,230
i use my hand to measure where i'm going
to be

288
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
to be
 

289
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,750
to be
that's where i tank on

290
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760

 

291
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,110

new point all this has to happen

292
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
new point all this has to happen
 

293
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,389
new point all this has to happen
incrementally

294
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399

 

295
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,430

do not expect to do it all at once so

296
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
do not expect to do it all at once so
 

297
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,829
do not expect to do it all at once so
here nothing on him nothing on him

298
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
here nothing on him nothing on him
 

299
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,110
here nothing on him nothing on him
no you're in the other dreamland

300
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
no you're in the other dreamland
 

301
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,630
no you're in the other dreamland
everything is incrementally

302
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
everything is incrementally
 

303
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,670
everything is incrementally
boom and then same thing as he goes up

304
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
boom and then same thing as he goes up
 

305
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,710
boom and then same thing as he goes up
so he comes up i'm not here

306
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
so he comes up i'm not here
 

307
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,910
so he comes up i'm not here
jerking him or here and using the other

308
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
jerking him or here and using the other
 

309
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,949
jerking him or here and using the other
hand

310
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
hand
 

311
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:34,829
hand
as he comes up i'm using the same

312
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:44,840

adhesion

314
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:44,850

 

315
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,829

[Music]

316
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

317
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839

so
