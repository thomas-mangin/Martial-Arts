00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
exactly how it appeared but i do know
 

53
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,750
exactly how it appeared but i do know
that it wasn't in the earliest work of

that it wasn't in the earliest work of
 

55
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,910
that it wasn't in the earliest work of
yoshiba and it does appear later and it

56
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
yoshiba and it does appear later and it
 

57
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,950
yoshiba and it does appear later and it
becomes a

58
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
becomes a
 

59
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,189
becomes a
very prominent technique

60
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
very prominent technique
 

61
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,830

right so meaning if i take my hands off
you can see i'm kind of towards the rear

88
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
you can see i'm kind of towards the rear
 

89
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,990
you can see i'm kind of towards the rear
if i go this way i'm kind of towards the

90
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
if i go this way i'm kind of towards the
 

91
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,590
if i go this way i'm kind of towards the
front so i want to get myself going

92
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
front so i want to get myself going
 

93
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,590
front so i want to get myself going
towards the rear here i want to grab

94
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
towards the rear here i want to grab
 

95
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,190
towards the rear here i want to grab
this arm give it a little twist and then

96
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
this arm give it a little twist and then
 

97
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,710
this arm give it a little twist and then
i want to drive into that elbow to drive

98
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
i want to drive into that elbow to drive
 

99
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,069
i want to drive into that elbow to drive
him down and this is a technique in and

100
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
him down and this is a technique in and
 

101
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,990
him down and this is a technique in and
of itself meaning i could take someone

102
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
of itself meaning i could take someone
 

103
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,749
of itself meaning i could take someone
down with this technique right so it's

104
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
down with this technique right so it's
 

105
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,749
down with this technique right so it's
possible to take someone down with this

106
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
possible to take someone down with this
 

107
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,910
possible to take someone down with this
okay so that's the basic idea now that

108
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
okay so that's the basic idea now that
 

109
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,230
okay so that's the basic idea now that
being said in my school the way i train

110
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
being said in my school the way i train
 

111
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,109
being said in my school the way i train
it is

112
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
it is
 

113
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,030
it is
the door is anytime there's two hands on

114
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
the door is anytime there's two hands on
 

115
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,710
the door is anytime there's two hands on
one hand right so that's morote dorian

116
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
one hand right so that's morote dorian
 

117
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,870
one hand right so that's morote dorian
all that's legitimate moro theodori that

118
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
all that's legitimate moro theodori that
 

119
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,789
all that's legitimate moro theodori that
being said this is going to be the

120
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
being said this is going to be the
 

121
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,469
being said this is going to be the
strongest version like this version is

122
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
strongest version like this version is
 

123
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,389
strongest version like this version is
super strong you can do more with it it

124
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
super strong you can do more with it it
 

125
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,469
super strong you can do more with it it
gives you more control okay what's nice

126
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
gives you more control okay what's nice
 

127
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,230
gives you more control okay what's nice
about this if we look at a weapon and

128
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
about this if we look at a weapon and
 

129
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,270
about this if we look at a weapon and
understand

130
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
understand
 

131
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,350
understand
this is probably always going to be done

132
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
this is probably always going to be done
 

133
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,270
this is probably always going to be done
as a weapon technique probably if you're

134
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
as a weapon technique probably if you're
 

135
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,710
as a weapon technique probably if you're
unarmed someone's not going to worry

136
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
unarmed someone's not going to worry
 

137
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,390
unarmed someone's not going to worry
about the dory because a body hold would

138
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
about the dory because a body hold would
 

139
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,670
about the dory because a body hold would
be better but if i went to a body hole

140
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
be better but if i went to a body hole
 

141
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,030
be better but if i went to a body hole
and he had a weapon he's going to load

142
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
and he had a weapon he's going to load
 

143
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,630
and he had a weapon he's going to load
me up so that's why i would have two

144
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
me up so that's why i would have two
 

145
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,390
me up so that's why i would have two
hands on his one hand to hold him so

146
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
hands on his one hand to hold him so
 

147
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,910
hands on his one hand to hold him so
this is probably always going to include

148
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
this is probably always going to include
 

149
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,229
this is probably always going to include
a weapon of some sort so when i have

150
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
a weapon of some sort so when i have
 

151
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,589
a weapon of some sort so when i have
that what's really great about this is

152
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
that what's really great about this is
 

153
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,830
that what's really great about this is
if i'm controlling him with morote if he

154
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
if i'm controlling him with morote if he
 

155
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,510
if i'm controlling him with morote if he
reaches to switch weapon hands you see

156
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
reaches to switch weapon hands you see
 

157
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,190
reaches to switch weapon hands you see
it's super hard for him if he comes up

158
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
it's super hard for him if he comes up
 

159
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,790
it's super hard for him if he comes up
to get me super super difficult for him

160
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
to get me super super difficult for him
 

161
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,390
to get me super super difficult for him
right so i have this position if he

162
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
right so i have this position if he
 

163
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,110
right so i have this position if he
pushes his elbow up then i get ikkyo

164
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
pushes his elbow up then i get ikkyo
 

165
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,869
pushes his elbow up then i get ikkyo
right so see i just turned into ikkyo if

166
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
right so see i just turned into ikkyo if
 

167
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,869
right so see i just turned into ikkyo if
he pushes down elbow down we have some

168
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
he pushes down elbow down we have some
 

169
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,229
he pushes down elbow down we have some
other techniques but that is actually

170
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
other techniques but that is actually
 

171
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,910
other techniques but that is actually
the best strategy for him is to work his

172
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
the best strategy for him is to work his
 

173
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,430
the best strategy for him is to work his
elbow down so let's go ahead and talk

174
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
elbow down so let's go ahead and talk
 

175
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,550
elbow down so let's go ahead and talk
about that and talk about this without a

176
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
about that and talk about this without a
 

177
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,830
about that and talk about this without a
knife first and then we'll go into some

178
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
knife first and then we'll go into some
 

179
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,190
knife first and then we'll go into some
more weapon stuff just because it's

180
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
more weapon stuff just because it's
 

181
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,470
more weapon stuff just because it's
easier to show without having to worry

182
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
easier to show without having to worry
 

183
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,150
easier to show without having to worry
about hitting myself or hitting josh

184
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
about hitting myself or hitting josh
 

185
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,229
about hitting myself or hitting josh
with the knife for a second okay so he

186
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
with the knife for a second okay so he
 

187
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,790
with the knife for a second okay so he
has my my hand like this right okay what

188
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
has my my hand like this right okay what
 

189
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,309
has my my hand like this right okay what
i want to do the core idea i want to do

190
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
i want to do the core idea i want to do
 

191
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,309
i want to do the core idea i want to do
is i want to get my elbow down

192
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
is i want to get my elbow down
 

193
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,149
is i want to get my elbow down
okay now just by getting my elbow down

194
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
okay now just by getting my elbow down
 

195
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,589
okay now just by getting my elbow down
if i could manage to do it in a violent

196
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
if i could manage to do it in a violent
 

197
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,350
if i could manage to do it in a violent
way i might be able to clear my hand

198
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
way i might be able to clear my hand
 

199
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,110
way i might be able to clear my hand
just like that because what this

200
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
just like that because what this
 

201
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,910
just like that because what this
basically does is it starts tearing my

202
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
basically does is it starts tearing my
 

203
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,229
basically does is it starts tearing my
hand out of his in this way in this way

204
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
hand out of his in this way in this way
 

205
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,390
hand out of his in this way in this way
right so so as i'm going through i'm

206
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
right so so as i'm going through i'm
 

207
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,630
right so so as i'm going through i'm
popping out like this so that in and of

208
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
popping out like this so that in and of
 

209
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,229
popping out like this so that in and of
itself just pushing my elbow down

210
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
itself just pushing my elbow down
 

211
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,470
itself just pushing my elbow down
expressing coq10 through my hand here

212
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
expressing coq10 through my hand here
 

213
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,070
expressing coq10 through my hand here
and moving into him with my elbow that

214
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
and moving into him with my elbow that
 

215
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,509
and moving into him with my elbow that
might clear so that could be a hadokey

216
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
might clear so that could be a hadokey
 

217
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,149
might clear so that could be a hadokey
in and of itself if that doesn't work

218
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
in and of itself if that doesn't work
 

219
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,949
in and of itself if that doesn't work
then i now have my arm under my control

220
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
then i now have my arm under my control
 

221
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,869
then i now have my arm under my control
so my body's controlling my arm now as

222
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
so my body's controlling my arm now as
 

223
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,550
so my body's controlling my arm now as
opposed to him using my arm to control

224
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
opposed to him using my arm to control
 

225
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,190
opposed to him using my arm to control
me this also facilitates switches right

226
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
me this also facilitates switches right
 

227
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,190
me this also facilitates switches right
so when we're looking at a knife

228
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
so when we're looking at a knife
 

229
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,630
so when we're looking at a knife
situation here if he's trying to control

230
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
situation here if he's trying to control
 

231
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,390
situation here if he's trying to control
that knife if i can drop my elbow i

232
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
that knife if i can drop my elbow i
 

233
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,550
that knife if i can drop my elbow i
immediately can switch and now he's in a

234
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
immediately can switch and now he's in a
 

235
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,750
immediately can switch and now he's in a
really bad way he's going to have to

236
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
really bad way he's going to have to
 

237
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,589
really bad way he's going to have to
track the knife over here so that

238
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
track the knife over here so that
 

239
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,670
track the knife over here so that
enables switches right off the bat now

240
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
enables switches right off the bat now
 

241
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,190
enables switches right off the bat now
there is all kinds of situations where

242
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
there is all kinds of situations where
 

243
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,470
there is all kinds of situations where
maybe he's got some kind of grip with

244
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
maybe he's got some kind of grip with
 

245
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,149
maybe he's got some kind of grip with
the morote that i can't switch right i

246
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
the morote that i can't switch right i
 

247
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,589
the morote that i can't switch right i
can't open my hand i can't get the knife

248
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
can't open my hand i can't get the knife
 

249
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,949
can't open my hand i can't get the knife
out so he's holding it in a way that

250
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
out so he's holding it in a way that
 

251
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,550
out so he's holding it in a way that
won't enable me to do that so i do need

252
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
won't enable me to do that so i do need
 

253
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,390
won't enable me to do that so i do need
to have other things other than just the

254
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
to have other things other than just the
 

255
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,869
to have other things other than just the
switch in mind so when i get to this

256
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
switch in mind so when i get to this
 

257
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,630
switch in mind so when i get to this
position uh

258
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
position uh
 

259
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,830
position uh
let's talk about that in one second i'll

260
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
let's talk about that in one second i'll
 

261
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,869
let's talk about that in one second i'll
talk about the techniques to start to

262
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
talk about the techniques to start to
 

263
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,149
talk about the techniques to start to
come off this but let's talk about how

264
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
come off this but let's talk about how
 

265
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,910
come off this but let's talk about how
he might give me trouble with this

266
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
he might give me trouble with this
 

267
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,509
he might give me trouble with this
position okay so i'll stick the knife

268
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
position okay so i'll stick the knife
 

269
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,550
position okay so i'll stick the knife
away again so we don't have to worry

270
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
away again so we don't have to worry
 

271
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,550
away again so we don't have to worry
about it for a second all right so now

272
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
about it for a second all right so now
 

273
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
about it for a second all right so now
one thing he might do is start twisting

274
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
one thing he might do is start twisting
 

275
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,229
one thing he might do is start twisting
my arm like this okay and he can twist

276
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
my arm like this okay and he can twist
 

277
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,430
my arm like this okay and he can twist
it all the way into a hammer lock right

278
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
it all the way into a hammer lock right
 

279
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,789
it all the way into a hammer lock right
so he can twist all the way up into this

280
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
so he can twist all the way up into this
 

281
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,030
so he can twist all the way up into this
position that's bad for me all right now

282
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
position that's bad for me all right now
 

283
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,950
position that's bad for me all right now
if he's stronger than me and he's

284
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
if he's stronger than me and he's
 

285
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,870
if he's stronger than me and he's
pushing my elbow that way and i'm trying

286
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
pushing my elbow that way and i'm trying
 

287
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,629
pushing my elbow that way and i'm trying
to push my elbow that way because he's

288
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
to push my elbow that way because he's
 

289
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,830
to push my elbow that way because he's
stronger than me of course he's going to

290
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
stronger than me of course he's going to
 

291
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,830
stronger than me of course he's going to
win and he has a major advantage here

292
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
win and he has a major advantage here
 

293
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,909
win and he has a major advantage here
because he's got two hands and i've only

294
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
because he's got two hands and i've only
 

295
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,430
because he's got two hands and i've only
got one so meaning i've got half the

296
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
got one so meaning i've got half the
 

297
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,629
got one so meaning i've got half the
strength even if we were equally

298
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
strength even if we were equally
 

299
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,629
strength even if we were equally
strength i got half the strength as him

300
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
strength i got half the strength as him
 

301
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,990
strength i got half the strength as him
if he's stronger than me it's really

302
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
if he's stronger than me it's really
 

303
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,590
if he's stronger than me it's really
really bad so what i'm going to use is a

304
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
really bad so what i'm going to use is a
 

305
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670
really bad so what i'm going to use is a
distraction technique here so instead of

306
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
distraction technique here so instead of
 

307
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,270
distraction technique here so instead of
trying to push my elbow straight back

308
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
trying to push my elbow straight back
 

309
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,110
trying to push my elbow straight back
i'm going to push my elbow at an angle

310
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
i'm going to push my elbow at an angle
 

311
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,629
i'm going to push my elbow at an angle
to where he's pushing and it's going to

312
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
to where he's pushing and it's going to
 

313
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,749
to where he's pushing and it's going to
be really hard to see this maybe i'll

314
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
be really hard to see this maybe i'll
 

315
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,430
be really hard to see this maybe i'll
put some arrows on this in editing later

316
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
put some arrows on this in editing later

but he's pushing my arm this way so what

318
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
but he's pushing my arm this way so what
 

319
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,510
but he's pushing my arm this way so what
i want to do is go at an angle that

320
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
i want to do is go at an angle that
 

321
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,590
i want to do is go at an angle that
doesn't oppose the angle he is so i'm

322
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
doesn't oppose the angle he is so i'm
 

323
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,749
doesn't oppose the angle he is so i'm
driving it here and then when i drive it

324
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
driving it here and then when i drive it
 

325
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,909
driving it here and then when i drive it
to the new position that's when i want

326
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
to the new position that's when i want
 

327
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,909
to the new position that's when i want
to try to start to work it down right so

328
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
to try to start to work it down right so
 

329
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,230
to try to start to work it down right so
instead of right here he pushes it over

330
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
instead of right here he pushes it over
 

331
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,469
instead of right here he pushes it over
and me resist him directly i drive it up

332
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
and me resist him directly i drive it up
 

333
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,990
and me resist him directly i drive it up
to a distraction point which will pull

334
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
to a distraction point which will pull
 

335
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,590
to a distraction point which will pull
him a little bit out of his power zone

336
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
him a little bit out of his power zone
 

337
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,950
him a little bit out of his power zone
and i can switch it over so if you see

338
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
and i can switch it over so if you see
 

339
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,870
and i can switch it over so if you see
what happens there when he goes this way

340
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
what happens there when he goes this way
 

341
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,790
what happens there when he goes this way
if i pull it like this you see he starts

342
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
if i pull it like this you see he starts
 

343
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,230
if i pull it like this you see he starts
to kind of get a little discombobulated

344
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
to kind of get a little discombobulated
 

345
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,670
to kind of get a little discombobulated
so he's not in a strong position as he

346
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
so he's not in a strong position as he
 

347
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,430
so he's not in a strong position as he
was before and then i might have the

348
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
was before and then i might have the
 

349
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,830
was before and then i might have the
ability to drive my elbow down so when

350
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
ability to drive my elbow down so when
 

351
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,909
ability to drive my elbow down so when
he's twisting my arm i don't want to

352
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
he's twisting my arm i don't want to
 

353
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,909
he's twisting my arm i don't want to
fight directly against it i want to pull

354
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
fight directly against it i want to pull
 

355
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,430
fight directly against it i want to pull
it at a different angle and then from

356
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
it at a different angle and then from
 

357
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,029
it at a different angle and then from
that different angle i start working and

358
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
that different angle i start working and
 

359
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,629
that different angle i start working and
it's not going to be one two like that

360
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
it's not going to be one two like that
 

361
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,390
it's not going to be one two like that
right so you're not going to go step one

362
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
right so you're not going to go step one
 

363
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,390
right so you're not going to go step one
new angle step two do this because by

364
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
new angle step two do this because by
 

365
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,670
new angle step two do this because by
the time you get step two he's gonna

366
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
the time you get step two he's gonna
 

367
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,830
the time you get step two he's gonna
readjust and he's to be strong again and

368
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
readjust and he's to be strong again and
 

369
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,510
readjust and he's to be strong again and
you're not going to get it so it's all

370
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
you're not going to get it so it's all
 

371
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,510
you're not going to get it so it's all
one action where he's pushing my elbow

372
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
one action where he's pushing my elbow
 

373
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,029
one action where he's pushing my elbow
this way and i pull it and i turn it

374
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
this way and i pull it and i turn it
 

375
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,629
this way and i pull it and i turn it
down the other the other way and this of

376
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
down the other the other way and this of
 

377
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,390
down the other the other way and this of
course gives me ecos and eating my nages

378
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
course gives me ecos and eating my nages
 

379
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,590
course gives me ecos and eating my nages
and all kinds of stuff can come off of

380
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
and all kinds of stuff can come off of
 

381
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,510
and all kinds of stuff can come off of
this but this is just a tactic when i'm

382
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
this but this is just a tactic when i'm
 

383
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,029
this but this is just a tactic when i'm
trying to push my elbow down and he's

384
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
trying to push my elbow down and he's
 

385
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,270
trying to push my elbow down and he's
resisting me to stop that from happening

386
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
resisting me to stop that from happening
 

387
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,990
resisting me to stop that from happening
okay now let's say we get here

388
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
okay now let's say we get here
 

389
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,390
okay now let's say we get here
to our elbow down position what is it

390
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
to our elbow down position what is it
 

391
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,749
to our elbow down position what is it
we're going to do from our elbow down

392
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
we're going to do from our elbow down
 

393
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,189
we're going to do from our elbow down
position well if i could switch i'd

394
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
position well if i could switch i'd
 

395
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,870
position well if i could switch i'd
switch if i couldn't switch so he had me

396
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
switch if i couldn't switch so he had me
 

397
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,070
switch if i couldn't switch so he had me
in some way and i'm not even going to

398
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
in some way and i'm not even going to
 

399
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,510
in some way and i'm not even going to
make josh worry about it right now so he

400
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
make josh worry about it right now so he
 

401
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,270
make josh worry about it right now so he
could do a ton of things right to keep

402
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
could do a ton of things right to keep
 

403
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,670
could do a ton of things right to keep
me from switching um but what i'm going

404
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
me from switching um but what i'm going
 

405
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,710
me from switching um but what i'm going
to worry about that right now i'm just

406
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
to worry about that right now i'm just
 

407
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,309
to worry about that right now i'm just
going to i can't switch for whatever

408
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
going to i can't switch for whatever
 

409
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,189
going to i can't switch for whatever
reason right so what can i do well i can

410
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
reason right so what can i do well i can
 

411
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,430
reason right so what can i do well i can
try to slide in here beside him like

412
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
try to slide in here beside him like
 

413
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,029
try to slide in here beside him like
this okay and let's move this way just a

414
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
this okay and let's move this way just a
 

415
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,270
this okay and let's move this way just a
pinch so i move slight side in side by

416
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
pinch so i move slight side in side by
 

417
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,550
pinch so i move slight side in side by
side with him here and this starts to

418
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
side with him here and this starts to
 

419
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,550
side with him here and this starts to
give me the ability to cook naga him now

420
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
give me the ability to cook naga him now
 

421
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,070
give me the ability to cook naga him now
when you think kokinagi maybe you think

422
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
when you think kokinagi maybe you think
 

423
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,350
when you think kokinagi maybe you think
some big throw that's going to end the

424
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
some big throw that's going to end the
 

425
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,830
some big throw that's going to end the
fight all the kokinagi is doing here is

426
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
fight all the kokinagi is doing here is
 

427
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,150
fight all the kokinagi is doing here is
nudging him away so i can start to get

428
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
nudging him away so i can start to get
 

429
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,189
nudging him away so i can start to get
advantages right so could just be that i

430
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
advantages right so could just be that i
 

431
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,469
advantages right so could just be that i
start to throw him and he doesn't like

432
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
start to throw him and he doesn't like
 

433
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,469
start to throw him and he doesn't like
it so he hops off of me but understand

434
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
it so he hops off of me but understand
 

435
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,390
it so he hops off of me but understand
that hopping off of me i got free which

436
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
that hopping off of me i got free which
 

437
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,390
that hopping off of me i got free which
is what i want right so all i'm trying

438
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
is what i want right so all i'm trying
 

439
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,629
is what i want right so all i'm trying
to do is give him a really hard time and

440
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
to do is give him a really hard time and
 

441
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,070
to do is give him a really hard time and
so that's what this kooky nugget will

442
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
so that's what this kooky nugget will
 

443
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,510
so that's what this kooky nugget will
allow me to do i start popping his

444
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
allow me to do i start popping his
 

445
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,950
allow me to do i start popping his
elbows a little or popping his hips a

446
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
elbows a little or popping his hips a
 

447
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,390
elbows a little or popping his hips a
little popping his hips a little bit and

448
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
little popping his hips a little bit and
 

449
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,230
little popping his hips a little bit and
i can start to move him around right so

450
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
i can start to move him around right so
 

451
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,909
i can start to move him around right so
what i don't want is him to stagnate

452
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
what i don't want is him to stagnate
 

453
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,909
what i don't want is him to stagnate
down and lock down on me in a way that i

454
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
down and lock down on me in a way that i
 

455
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,110
down and lock down on me in a way that i
can't do anything about it because he's

456
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
can't do anything about it because he's
 

457
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,629
can't do anything about it because he's
stronger than me right so i've got to be

458
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
stronger than me right so i've got to be
 

459
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,070
stronger than me right so i've got to be
nudging him and popping him and moving

460
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
nudging him and popping him and moving
 

461
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,589
nudging him and popping him and moving
him so that way i have i have

462
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
him so that way i have i have
 

463
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,430
him so that way i have i have
opportunities in those movements that

464
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
opportunities in those movements that
 

465
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,950
opportunities in those movements that
happen okay now let's say this side

466
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
happen okay now let's say this side
 

467
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,550
happen okay now let's say this side
isn't working out for me for whatever

468
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
isn't working out for me for whatever
 

469
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,029
isn't working out for me for whatever
reason i can always work this side and

470
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
reason i can always work this side and
 

471
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,150
reason i can always work this side and
on this side i'm going to probably

472
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
on this side i'm going to probably
 

473
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,070
on this side i'm going to probably
primarily work my ikyo here and i'm

474
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
primarily work my ikyo here and i'm
 

475
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,830
primarily work my ikyo here and i'm
going to work my nikyo here if the

476
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
going to work my nikyo here if the
 

477
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,589
going to work my nikyo here if the
elbow's up i'm going to be working my

478
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
elbow's up i'm going to be working my
 

479
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,589
elbow's up i'm going to be working my
echo if the elbow's going down i'm going

480
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
echo if the elbow's going down i'm going
 

481
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,870
echo if the elbow's going down i'm going
to be working my kneecap so that's going

482
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
to be working my kneecap so that's going
 

483
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,270
to be working my kneecap so that's going
to be my main escape ideas going to that

484
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
to be my main escape ideas going to that
 

485
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,230
to be my main escape ideas going to that
side okay now if i can't get my elbow

486
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
side okay now if i can't get my elbow
 

487
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,870
side okay now if i can't get my elbow
down what am i going to do i want to run

488
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
down what am i going to do i want to run
 

489
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,790
down what am i going to do i want to run
around to the front and i'm going to try

490
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
around to the front and i'm going to try
 

491
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,550
around to the front and i'm going to try
to get a myotosh so i'm going to try and

492
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
to get a myotosh so i'm going to try and
 

493
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,550
to get a myotosh so i'm going to try and
shoot around this side and hit the arms

494
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
shoot around this side and hit the arms
 

495
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,950
shoot around this side and hit the arms
here to get myotosh in that now when i'm

496
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
here to get myotosh in that now when i'm
 

497
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,749
here to get myotosh in that now when i'm
doing that understand that it's not

498
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
doing that understand that it's not
 

499
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,230
doing that understand that it's not
going to be easy because i can't when

500
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
going to be easy because i can't when
 

501
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,070
going to be easy because i can't when
i'm practicing the technique i can't

502
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
i'm practicing the technique i can't
 

503
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,510
i'm practicing the technique i can't
allow my elbow to drop because if i

504
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
allow my elbow to drop because if i
 

505
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,110
allow my elbow to drop because if i
could drop this would be a better

506
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
could drop this would be a better
 

507
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,710
could drop this would be a better
situation i'm trying to train a

508
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
situation i'm trying to train a
 

509
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,950
situation i'm trying to train a
technique where my elbow can't drop so

510
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
technique where my elbow can't drop so
 

511
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,070
technique where my elbow can't drop so
what you're going to do is shoot your

512
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
what you're going to do is shoot your
 

513
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,430
what you're going to do is shoot your
hands straight through as much as you

514
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
hands straight through as much as you
 

515
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,550
hands straight through as much as you
can this is kind of like the same

516
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
can this is kind of like the same
 

517
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,830
can this is kind of like the same
distraction technique we talked about

518
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
distraction technique we talked about
 

519
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,270
distraction technique we talked about
before i'm going to shoot my elbow

520
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
before i'm going to shoot my elbow
 

521
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,629
before i'm going to shoot my elbow
through a little bit and then as i do

522
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
through a little bit and then as i do
 

523
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,230
through a little bit and then as i do
that i'm going to use that to turn right

524
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
that i'm going to use that to turn right
 

525
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,430
that i'm going to use that to turn right
here and that's going to put me in

526
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
here and that's going to put me in
 

527
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,270
here and that's going to put me in
position to pop these elbows as hard as

528
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
position to pop these elbows as hard as
 

529
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,510
position to pop these elbows as hard as
i can and try and get free there now of

530
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
i can and try and get free there now of
 

531
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,830
i can and try and get free there now of
course if i couldn't pop those elbows

532
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
course if i couldn't pop those elbows
 

533
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,510
course if i couldn't pop those elbows
free then i'm going to try to work

534
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
free then i'm going to try to work
 

535
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,510
free then i'm going to try to work
underneath it we get juji for that we

536
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
underneath it we get juji for that we
 

537
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,950
underneath it we get juji for that we
get a whole series of techniques for

538
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
get a whole series of techniques for
 

539
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,869
get a whole series of techniques for
that but that's the idea right so i

540
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
that but that's the idea right so i
 

541
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,629
that but that's the idea right so i
can't drop my elbow so i go to the other

542
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
can't drop my elbow so i go to the other
 

543
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,270
can't drop my elbow so i go to the other
side i try my myotosh i can't get my

544
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
side i try my myotosh i can't get my
 

545
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,950
side i try my myotosh i can't get my
myotosh i try to slide underneath and i

546
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
myotosh i try to slide underneath and i
 

547
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,869
myotosh i try to slide underneath and i
get juji and a whole bunch of stuff will

548
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
get juji and a whole bunch of stuff will
 

549
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,110
get juji and a whole bunch of stuff will
come come into that series

550
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
come come into that series
 

551
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,629
come come into that series
okay so now let's say i get in side by

552
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
okay so now let's say i get in side by
 

553
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,830
okay so now let's say i get in side by
side but every time i try to pop his

554
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
side but every time i try to pop his
 

555
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,550
side but every time i try to pop his
hips he he's dancing around in a

556
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
hips he he's dancing around in a
 

557
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,469
hips he he's dancing around in a
controlled way so i mean he's really

558
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
controlled way so i mean he's really
 

559
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,990
controlled way so i mean he's really
pretty controlled and actually let me

560
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
pretty controlled and actually let me
 

561
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,589
pretty controlled and actually let me
take you kimmy for josh for this i'll

562
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
take you kimmy for josh for this i'll
 

563
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,829
take you kimmy for josh for this i'll
show you let's go to this side okay so

564
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
show you let's go to this side okay so
 

565
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,829
show you let's go to this side okay so
as he drops that elbow i'm super

566
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
as he drops that elbow i'm super
 

567
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,670
as he drops that elbow i'm super
flexible so see i still have full grip

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
hasn't broken at all and every time he
 

573
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,990
hasn't broken at all and every time he
tries to get close to my hips i kind of

574
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
tries to get close to my hips i kind of
 

575
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,750
tries to get close to my hips i kind of
do this number right so let's come over

576
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
do this number right so let's come over
 

577
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,269
do this number right so let's come over
here a little more so you can see he's

578
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
here a little more so you can see he's
 

579
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,630
here a little more so you can see he's
trying to get close to my hips and i'm

580

his elbow down i can't change that he's
 

587
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,949
his elbow down i can't change that he's
too strong for me to change that but i

588
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
too strong for me to change that but i
 

589
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,110
too strong for me to change that but i
do have his arm in a second i'm going to

590
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
do have his arm in a second i'm going to
 

591
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,550
do have his arm in a second i'm going to
change to a better position so he's got

592
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
change to a better position so he's got
 

593
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,990
change to a better position so he's got
to work fast but what he's going to do

594
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
to work fast but what he's going to do
 

595
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,350
to work fast but what he's going to do
here is he's going to shoot right

596
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
here is he's going to shoot right
 

597
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,630
here is he's going to shoot right
underneath right so he's going to shoot

598
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
underneath right so he's going to shoot
 

599
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,230
underneath right so he's going to shoot
right here and he gets sankyo and a

600
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
right here and he gets sankyo and a
 

601
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,910
right here and he gets sankyo and a
whole series of techniques from this

602
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
whole series of techniques from this
 

603
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,949
whole series of techniques from this
okay so

604
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
okay so
 

605
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,870
okay so
if you can see this progression you can

606
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
if you can see this progression you can
 

607
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,750
if you can see this progression you can
understand how the mirote dory is not a

608
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
understand how the mirote dory is not a
 

609
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,110
understand how the mirote dory is not a
static thing the morote dori is always

610
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
static thing the morote dori is always
 

611
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,030
static thing the morote dori is always
moving and evolving and as the person

612
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
moving and evolving and as the person
 

613
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,630
moving and evolving and as the person
who's at the disadvantage and that's

614
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
who's at the disadvantage and that's
 

615
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,990
who's at the disadvantage and that's
where you're practicing aikido from i'm

616
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
where you're practicing aikido from i'm
 

617
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,070
where you're practicing aikido from i'm
always at the disadvantaged position my

618
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
always at the disadvantaged position my
 

619
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,910
always at the disadvantaged position my
job is to keep that other guy moving as

620
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
job is to keep that other guy moving as
 

621
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,990
job is to keep that other guy moving as
much as possible so i can take advantage

622
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
much as possible so i can take advantage
 

623
