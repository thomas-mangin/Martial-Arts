00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
it's not what we do okay
 

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,230
it's not what we do okay
so watch things that make you

186
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
so watch things that make you
 

187
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,070
so watch things that make you
have to do that okay if i pull my arm up

188
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
have to do that okay if i pull my arm up
 

189
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,950
have to do that okay if i pull my arm up
like that

190
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
like that
 

191
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,629
like that
he's closing the gap it's one of the

192
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
he's closing the gap it's one of the
 

193
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,350
he's closing the gap it's one of the
things you do

194
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
things you do
 

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,589
things you do
when uh he's close

196
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
when uh he's close
 

197
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,790
when uh he's close
so he's close it's going to be hard to

198
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
so he's close it's going to be hard to
 

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,469
so he's close it's going to be hard to
do that round kick here

200
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
do that round kick here
 

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,469
do that round kick here
but i can come up and hit with a

202
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
but i can come up and hit with a
 

203
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,749
but i can come up and hit with a
crescent i can

204
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
crescent i can
 

205
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,430
crescent i can
seek vertical height and not be

206
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
seek vertical height and not be
 

207
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,550
seek vertical height and not be
compacted by the range but he's close so

208
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
compacted by the range but he's close so
 

209
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,710
compacted by the range but he's close so
when you change your vertical

210
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
when you change your vertical
 

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,390
when you change your vertical
he's actually getting closer he's

212
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
he's actually getting closer he's
 

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,150
he's actually getting closer he's
allowed to get closer

214
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
allowed to get closer
 

215
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,830
allowed to get closer
so you want that big line up

216
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
so you want that big line up
 

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,990
so you want that big line up
he's moving close you see and by the

218
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
he's moving close you see and by the
 

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,790
he's moving close you see and by the
time i get his passenger

220
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800

 

221
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,149

on this version that's going to be

222
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
on this version that's going to be
 

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,589
on this version that's going to be
a lot of trouble whoa you're like

224
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
a lot of trouble whoa you're like
 

225
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,310
a lot of trouble whoa you're like
on but he's already passed

226
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
on but he's already passed
 

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:48,230
on but he's already passed
second one is you believe

228
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240

 

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,190

he's out here now

230
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200

 

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,150

so this version we did here was just

232
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
so this version we did here was just
 

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,230
so this version we did here was just
here

234
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240

 

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,030

and this hand with that movement starts

236
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
and this hand with that movement starts
 

237
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,470
and this hand with that movement starts
to go down immediately

238
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
to go down immediately
 

239
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,829
to go down immediately
it doesn't go up down

240
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839

 

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,710

it moves down down

242
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720

 

243
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,509

then if i don't have the projection

244
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
then if i don't have the projection
 

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,389
then if i don't have the projection
that's going to be

246
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
that's going to be
 

247
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:39,710
that's going to be
a hard stuff okay can't get rid of that

248
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,720

 

249
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:48,829

251
00:09:48,839 --> 00:10:09,590

hey

252
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600

 

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,030

oh you're trapped by the x y

254
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
oh you're trapped by the x y
 

255
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,910
oh you're trapped by the x y
so just like any simple technique and

256
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
so just like any simple technique and
 

257
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,350
so just like any simple technique and
then you picture this

258
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
then you picture this
 

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,470
then you picture this
that big acidity

260
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
that big acidity
 

261
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,550
that big acidity
and then you can't ever get you you

262
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
and then you can't ever get you you
 

263
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,389
and then you can't ever get you you
can't ever get there

264
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
can't ever get there
 

265
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,190
can't ever get there
can't get there in real life okay this

266
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
can't get there in real life okay this
 

267
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,829
can't get there in real life okay this
is

268
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
is
 

269
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,790
is
pretty um so we do things like

270
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
pretty um so we do things like
 

271
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,150
pretty um so we do things like
we do the technique here

272
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160

 

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,990

so i brought him in a circle so i get

274
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
so i brought him in a circle so i get
 

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,829
so i brought him in a circle so i get
used to the idea that he has to move in

276
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
used to the idea that he has to move in
 

277
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,910
used to the idea that he has to move in
a certain way then eb opens it's no

278
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
a certain way then eb opens it's no
 

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,550
a certain way then eb opens it's no
different

280
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
different
 

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,310
different
the opening has to present itself i

282
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
the opening has to present itself i
 

283
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,310
the opening has to present itself i
don't create the opening the opening has

284
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
don't create the opening the opening has
 

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,870
don't create the opening the opening has
to present

286
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
to present
 

287
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,470
to present
itself okay so so uh he does the strike

288
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
itself okay so so uh he does the strike
 

289
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,350
itself okay so so uh he does the strike
right and i'm here like this and then

290
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
right and i'm here like this and then
 

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,310
right and i'm here like this and then
pause

it could be something like that right
he's trying to grab

298
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
he's trying to grab
 

299
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,389
he's trying to grab
he's grabbing me i do my deviation he

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
comes back in
 

303
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,030
comes back in
right go back it comes back in and then

304
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
right go back it comes back in and then
 

305
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,710
right go back it comes back in and then
i have my id

306
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
i have my id

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,470
i have my id
so the opening has to present itself

308
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
so the opening has to present itself
 

309
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,030
so the opening has to present itself
and x y never does it

310
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
and x y never does it
 

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,110
and x y never does it
x y is you create an opening this is not

312
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
x y is you create an opening this is not
 

313
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,710
x y is you create an opening this is not
jiu-jitsu okay so

314
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
jiu-jitsu okay so
 

315
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,470
jiu-jitsu okay so
uh i'm doing this technique here

316
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
uh i'm doing this technique here
 

317
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,590
uh i'm doing this technique here
and you're thinking x y so

318
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
and you're thinking x y so
 

319
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,910
and you're thinking x y so
i get out of the way

320
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920

 

321
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,710

instead don't don't try to throw him in

322
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
instead don't don't try to throw him in
 

323
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,910
instead don't don't try to throw him in
here

324
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
here
 

325
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,990
here
start the whole technique rotating

326
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
start the whole technique rotating
 

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,190
start the whole technique rotating
especially if you're going to do the

328
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
especially if you're going to do the
 

329
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,990
especially if you're going to do the
edibi

330
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000

 

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,430

so well here

332
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440

 

333
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,150

there's no rule why he has to go that

334
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
there's no rule why he has to go that
 

335
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,949
there's no rule why he has to go that
way

336
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
way
 

337
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,110
way
why he has to stay on that

338
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120

 

339
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,790

he has to go around you know he went

340
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
he has to go around you know he went
 

341
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,190
he has to go around you know he went
around with me but if he goes too far

342
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
around with me but if he goes too far
 

343
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,030
around with me but if he goes too far
this is not the technique

344
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040

 

345
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,430

so technique is here

346
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440

 

347
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,269

have more the feeling of what you're

348
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
have more the feeling of what you're
 

349
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,790
have more the feeling of what you're
doing so

350
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
doing so
 

351
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,310
doing so
yen boom project

352
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320

 

353
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,829

then then you can enter

354
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839

 

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,190

you can yield

356
