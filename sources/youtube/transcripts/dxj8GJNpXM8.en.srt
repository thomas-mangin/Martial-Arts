1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,730

so here uh we'll do part four of video

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:07,740
so here uh we'll do part four of video
 

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,730
so here uh we'll do part four of video
Gateway Aikido video 15.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:10,740
Gateway Aikido video 15.
 

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,089
Gateway Aikido video 15.
okay so uh

6
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099
okay so uh
 

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,650
okay so uh
part four let's look at keyhon go to

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:18,660
part four let's look at keyhon go to
 

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,090
part four let's look at keyhon go to
kihon

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,100
kihon
 

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,269
kihon
and understand it

12
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
and understand it
 

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,029
and understand it
in such a way that is not violating

14
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:26,039
in such a way that is not violating
 

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,349
in such a way that is not violating
anything we did in uh videos part one

16
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:30,359
anything we did in uh videos part one
 

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,110
anything we did in uh videos part one
part two and part three so we're not

18
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
part two and part three so we're not
 

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,510
part two and part three so we're not
going to clash and we're not going to

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
going to clash and we're not going to
 

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,370
going to clash and we're not going to
stop him

22
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:37,380
stop him
 

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,729
stop him
so generally we're going to think in

24
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:40,739
so generally we're going to think in
 

25
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,270
so generally we're going to think in
again in yin and yang but generally uh I

26
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,280
again in yin and yang but generally uh I
 

27
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,610
again in yin and yang but generally uh I
would have a Mimi and a 10 con variant

28
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:46,620
would have a Mimi and a 10 con variant
 

29
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,630
would have a Mimi and a 10 con variant
okay for me to do an edemy variant of a

30
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
okay for me to do an edemy variant of a
 

31
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,830
okay for me to do an edemy variant of a
kihon I have to catch the strike in its

32
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:54,840
kihon I have to catch the strike in its
 

33
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,330
kihon I have to catch the strike in its
Yin phase

34
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,340
Yin phase
 

35
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,950
Yin phase
for me to do a 10 con variant of the

36
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
for me to do a 10 con variant of the
 

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,969
for me to do a 10 con variant of the
kihon I have caught this strike in its

38
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:04,979
kihon I have caught this strike in its
 

39
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,429
kihon I have caught this strike in its
young phase you and I won't mix the two

40
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
young phase you and I won't mix the two
 

41
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,670
young phase you and I won't mix the two
okay so for example if he's doing

42
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
okay so for example if he's doing
 

43
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,350
okay so for example if he's doing
yokumin

44
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,360
yokumin
 

45
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,390
yokumin
Uchi remember that strikes are closer so

46
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
Uchi remember that strikes are closer so
 

47
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,969
Uchi remember that strikes are closer so
don't start a million miles away okay so

48
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:16,979
don't start a million miles away okay so
 

49
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,770
don't start a million miles away okay so
when he comes in I am not going to go I

50
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:21,780
when he comes in I am not going to go I
 

51
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,469
when he comes in I am not going to go I
caught it on the young you see that

52
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
caught it on the young you see that
 

53
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,190
caught it on the young you see that
would be a young young Clash so instead

54
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
would be a young young Clash so instead
 

55
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,550
would be a young young Clash so instead
I have to catch it on the yin then it'll

56
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:31,560
I have to catch it on the yin then it'll
 

57
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,830
I have to catch it on the yin then it'll
work okay so if we look at his stride

58
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:36,840
work okay so if we look at his stride
 

59
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,710
work okay so if we look at his stride
his strikes coming up and here's where I

60
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
his strikes coming up and here's where I
 

61
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,870
his strikes coming up and here's where I
should already have contact and when he

62
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:41,880
should already have contact and when he
 

63
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,330
should already have contact and when he
flares the elbow or the hand comes out

64
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,340
flares the elbow or the hand comes out
 

65
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,130
flares the elbow or the hand comes out
you see that to give him his kesa angle

66
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,140
you see that to give him his kesa angle
 

67
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,850
you see that to give him his kesa angle
that is the yin movement that I use uh

68
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:52,860
that is the yin movement that I use uh
 

69
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,289
that is the yin movement that I use uh
to take his body off balance okay we're

70
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,299
to take his body off balance okay we're
 

71
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,730
to take his body off balance okay we're
gonna do it and see what it was like

72
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:58,740
gonna do it and see what it was like
 

73
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,830
gonna do it and see what it was like
because we have had so many Gateway

74
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
because we have had so many Gateway
 

75
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,550
because we have had so many Gateway
requests that we here haven't done

76
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,560
requests that we here haven't done
 

77
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,889
requests that we here haven't done
suareza and we started to do a lot of

78
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:06,899
suareza and we started to do a lot of
 

79
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,669
suareza and we started to do a lot of
suareza so we're gonna do it

80
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
suareza so we're gonna do it
 

81
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,830
suareza so we're gonna do it
is actually harder so when if it works

82
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
is actually harder so when if it works
 

83
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,990
is actually harder so when if it works
here it's gonna work in tachiwasa again

84
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,000
here it's gonna work in tachiwasa again
 

85
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,190
here it's gonna work in tachiwasa again
okay so as he comes up that is when I've

86
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
okay so as he comes up that is when I've
 

87
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,830
okay so as he comes up that is when I've
done the movement okay and then his

88
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
done the movement okay and then his
 

89
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,170
done the movement okay and then his
commitment carries through

90
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,180
commitment carries through
 

91
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,309
commitment carries through
and then you won't have that uh Yang

92
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
and then you won't have that uh Yang
 

93
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,130
and then you won't have that uh Yang
Yang Clash however

94
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,140
Yang Clash however
 

95
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,089
Yang Clash however
you have to use the two spirals we

96
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:35,099
you have to use the two spirals we
 

97
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,270
you have to use the two spirals we
always refer to so you have the inward

98
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,280
always refer to so you have the inward
 

99
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,830
always refer to so you have the inward
spiral

100
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
spiral
 

101
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,309
spiral
and you have the outer spiral

102
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319
and you have the outer spiral
 

103
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,949
and you have the outer spiral
you're going to do the inward spiral

104
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:45,959
you're going to do the inward spiral
 

105
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,750
you're going to do the inward spiral
here

106
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
here
 

107
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,869
here
it's gonna I'm not gonna go here like

108
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
it's gonna I'm not gonna go here like
 

109
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,330
it's gonna I'm not gonna go here like
that

110
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,340

 

111
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,270

once I make contact I do the inward

112
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,280
once I make contact I do the inward
 

113
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,910
once I make contact I do the inward
spiral and when I move my body I'm on

114
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,920
spiral and when I move my body I'm on
 

115
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,490
spiral and when I move my body I'm on
the outside of the inward spiral and it

116
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:01,500
the outside of the inward spiral and it
 

117
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,190
the outside of the inward spiral and it
creates

118
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,200

 

119
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,390

a turning of his initial or inertial

120
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
a turning of his initial or inertial
 

121
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,229
a turning of his initial or inertial
movement forward so I'm not going here

122
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
movement forward so I'm not going here
 

123
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,170
movement forward so I'm not going here
even if it was on the yin move I'm not

124
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
even if it was on the yin move I'm not
 

125
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,850
even if it was on the yin move I'm not
doing that

126
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:16,860
doing that
 

127
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,949
doing that
I make contact and I do the spiral

128
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:21,959

 

129
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,890

and we're here

130
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:27,900

 

131
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:36,770

contact on the inside

132
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:36,780

 

133
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,089

it's different

134
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:38,099
it's different
 

135
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,369
it's different
you can say it's different it sounds

136
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:40,379
you can say it's different it sounds
 

137
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,130
you can say it's different it sounds
different it feels different there's no

138
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,140
different it feels different there's no
 

139
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,930
different it feels different there's no
connection

140
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:47,940

 

141
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,770

so once you get there that's where it'll

142
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:51,780
so once you get there that's where it'll
 

143
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,509
so once you get there that's where it'll
come back up that's where you would have

144
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
come back up that's where you would have
 

145
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,729
come back up that's where you would have
all your

146
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:55,739
all your
 

147
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,149
all your
technique or whatever you wanted to do

148
00:03:59,149 --> 00:03:59,159
technique or whatever you wanted to do
 

149
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,089
technique or whatever you wanted to do
okay so again

150
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,099
okay so again
 

151
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,649
okay so again
boom

152
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:03,659
boom
 

153
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,009
boom
I'm doing this inward spiral

154
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,019
I'm doing this inward spiral
 

155
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,949
I'm doing this inward spiral
but it's in relation to that

156
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
but it's in relation to that
 

157
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,470
but it's in relation to that
and it's going this way

158
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
and it's going this way
 

159
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,550
and it's going this way
and my body does it

160
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:15,560
and my body does it
 

161
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,310
and my body does it
okay so our simple throw here is hold

162
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,320
okay so our simple throw here is hold
 

163
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,850
okay so our simple throw here is hold
the elbow palmio that faced ad me off

164
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:22,860
the elbow palmio that faced ad me off
 

165
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,890
the elbow palmio that faced ad me off
the line of attack you'll make

166
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:24,900
the line of attack you'll make
 

167
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,150
the line of attack you'll make
connection all right let's try it

168
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160

 

169
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,730

Hugo I'm gonna talk okay here it's not

170
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:31,740
Hugo I'm gonna talk okay here it's not
 

171
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,670
Hugo I'm gonna talk okay here it's not
you it's the whole world does this so

172
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
you it's the whole world does this so
 

173
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,129
you it's the whole world does this so
you see he's gone from the inside to the

174
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:37,139
you see he's gone from the inside to the
 

175
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,650
you see he's gone from the inside to the
outside he cuts down that that's what

176
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:39,660
outside he cuts down that that's what
 

177
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,730
outside he cuts down that that's what
the whole world sees okay

178
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740

 

179
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,150

and that's just not it okay so if you

180
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,160
and that's just not it okay so if you
 

181
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,950
and that's just not it okay so if you
come in faster and harder with more

182
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
come in faster and harder with more
 

183
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,350
come in faster and harder with more
inertial movement forward you can see

184
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
inertial movement forward you can see
 

185
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,650
inertial movement forward you can see
the Clash do you see okay it's just most

186
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,660
the Clash do you see okay it's just most
 

187

questions don't go standing okay
so I I'm I am doing this

194
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
so I I'm I am doing this
 

195
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,110
so I I'm I am doing this
there's your movement ah right only I'm

196
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,120
there's your movement ah right only I'm
 

197
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,909
there's your movement ah right only I'm
gonna move to the side

gonna move to the side
 

199
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,629
gonna move to the side
excuse me got it and then I'm gonna turn

200
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
excuse me got it and then I'm gonna turn
 

201
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,950
excuse me got it and then I'm gonna turn
his body with that movement do you see

202
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:21,960
his body with that movement do you see
 

203
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,010
his body with that movement do you see
that's basically it and then what once

204
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
that's basically it and then what once
 

205
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,070
that's basically it and then what once
he goes cool then that's where I can

206
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
he goes cool then that's where I can
 

207
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,529
he goes cool then that's where I can
come over the top okay

208
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:30,539
come over the top okay
 

209
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,490
come over the top okay
so I again I'm not going here

210
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,500
so I again I'm not going here
 

211
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,129
so I again I'm not going here
I'm actually going here

212
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:37,139
I'm actually going here
 

213
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,070
I'm actually going here
but my body's moving there

214
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
but my body's moving there
 

215
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,070
but my body's moving there
you see so if you wash my hand

216
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080

now watch my hand
 

223
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,230
now watch my hand
you say it's going this way only my body

224
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
you say it's going this way only my body
 

225
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,510
you say it's going this way only my body
goes cool

226
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520

 

227
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,890

okay so you gotta trust the inner spiral

228
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:00,900
okay so you gotta trust the inner spiral
 

229
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,310
okay so you gotta trust the inner spiral
but it's the IQ adhesion too okay so

230
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,320
but it's the IQ adhesion too okay so
 

231
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,390
but it's the IQ adhesion too okay so
boom I'm good he's gonna make contact

232
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:07,400
boom I'm good he's gonna make contact
 

233
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,129
boom I'm good he's gonna make contact
and I am

234
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:10,139
and I am
 

235
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,090
and I am
going to do the inward spiral

236
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,100

 

237
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,890

from there

238
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:15,900
from there
 

239
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,210
from there
boom this way but I moved

240
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,220
boom this way but I moved
 

241
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,950
boom this way but I moved
okay

242
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:21,960
okay
 

243
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,450
okay
try it again

244
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,460
try it again
 

245
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,930
try it again
okay so even even my destiny here are

246
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:26,940
okay so even even my destiny here are
 

247
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,969
okay so even even my destiny here are
having problems with this

248
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:28,979
having problems with this
 

249
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,469
having problems with this
um

250
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
um
 

251
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,930
um
Energy's coming this way

252
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:32,940
Energy's coming this way
 

253
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,469
Energy's coming this way
but you ain't eat meat you see so you

254
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
but you ain't eat meat you see so you
 

255
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,230
but you ain't eat meat you see so you
have to ID me on the yin movement that

256
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,240
have to ID me on the yin movement that
 

257
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,430
have to ID me on the yin movement that
makes sense

258
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,440
makes sense
 

259
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,529
makes sense
but it doesn't mean now I just get to

260
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:42,539
but it doesn't mean now I just get to
 

261
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,290
but it doesn't mean now I just get to
slam the dude because you won't you'll

262
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,300
slam the dude because you won't you'll
 

263
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,629
slam the dude because you won't you'll
what you'll do is you'll isolate the arm

264
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:47,639
what you'll do is you'll isolate the arm
 

265
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,870
what you'll do is you'll isolate the arm
okay so what happens I go like that you

266
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
okay so what happens I go like that you
 

267
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,390
okay so what happens I go like that you
see his arm disconnected from his body

268
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,400
see his arm disconnected from his body
 

269
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,510
see his arm disconnected from his body
you see that I don't have his body

270
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:56,520
you see that I don't have his body
 

271
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,850
you see that I don't have his body
what generally what you're what you're

272
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:58,860
what generally what you're what you're
 

273
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,189
what generally what you're what you're
choreographed UK does is when you

274
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
choreographed UK does is when you
 

275
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,689
choreographed UK does is when you
disconnect the on they'll turn their

276
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
disconnect the on they'll turn their
 

277
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,670
disconnect the on they'll turn their
body you see well if he could turn

278
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
body you see well if he could turn
 

279
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,950
body you see well if he could turn
himself then I didn't have his Center

280
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
himself then I didn't have his Center
 

281
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,309
himself then I didn't have his Center
you see that so that's not a solution

282
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
you see that so that's not a solution
 

283
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,550
you see that so that's not a solution
so same thing as I'm here I have this

284
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
so same thing as I'm here I have this
 

285
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,730
so same thing as I'm here I have this
whole body and the faster and harder he

286
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
whole body and the faster and harder he
 

287
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,390
whole body and the faster and harder he
strikes the easier it'll be to do

288
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
strikes the easier it'll be to do
 

289
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,870
strikes the easier it'll be to do
because there's more energy for me to

290
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:23,880
because there's more energy for me to
 

291
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,510
because there's more energy for me to
turn back around do you see that so on

292
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,520
turn back around do you see that so on
 

293
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,330
turn back around do you see that so on
that one you actually got a little

294
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,340
that one you actually got a little
 

295
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,010
that one you actually got a little
Airborne I'm gonna see what he wants a

296
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,020
Airborne I'm gonna see what he wants a
 

297
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,589
Airborne I'm gonna see what he wants a
technique you see that when so what

298
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
technique you see that when so what
 

299
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,529
technique you see that when so what
happens is I go here

300
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:35,539
happens is I go here
 

301
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,089
happens is I go here
eventually this movement is going to

302
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,099
eventually this movement is going to
 

303
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,029
eventually this movement is going to
turn him around do you see and now which

304
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
turn him around do you see and now which
 

305
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,589
turn him around do you see and now which
way is he going

306
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:42,599
way is he going
 

307
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,029
way is he going
that way

308
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:44,039
that way
 

309
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,670
that way
so once you once I feel it go that way

310
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:46,680
so once you once I feel it go that way
 

311
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,990
so once you once I feel it go that way
wants energy I turn the energy

312
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
wants energy I turn the energy
 

313
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,210
wants energy I turn the energy
then I can enter that's where I cap the

314
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,220
then I can enter that's where I cap the
 

315
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,790
then I can enter that's where I cap the
elbow that's where I throw this strike I

316
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800
elbow that's where I throw this strike I
 

317
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,830
elbow that's where I throw this strike I
already turned him around does that make

318
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
already turned him around does that make
 

319
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,610
already turned him around does that make
sense so it's not that I'm going here

320
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:00,620
sense so it's not that I'm going here
 

321
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,510
sense so it's not that I'm going here
stopping him

322
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
stopping him
 

323
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,890
stopping him
I turn him and then he's he's here now

324
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,900
I turn him and then he's he's here now
 

325
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,909
I turn him and then he's he's here now
for me to do young movement you see that

326
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
for me to do young movement you see that
 

327
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,189
for me to do young movement you see that
okay

328
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199

 

329
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,010

okay so we we just said it so that's

330
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,020
okay so we we just said it so that's
 

331

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
what I always say he should already be
 

333
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,809
what I always say he should already be
going the other way by the time I enter

334
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:20,819
going the other way by the time I enter
 

335
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,710
going the other way by the time I enter
if he's not going the other way until I

336
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
if he's not going the other way until I
 

337
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,869
if he's not going the other way until I
enter that would be a young young Clash

338
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
enter that would be a young young Clash
 

339
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,270
enter that would be a young young Clash
okay so I already turned it that way he

340
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
okay so I already turned it that way he
 

341
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,249
okay so I already turned it that way he
was already falling that way and now I

342
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:31,259
was already falling that way and now I
 

343
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,430
was already falling that way and now I
aim a falling body okay

344
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440
aim a falling body okay
 

345
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,089
aim a falling body okay
um

346
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:38,099

 

347
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,409

so if I I go to catch it but I'm a

all
 

357
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,850
all
do you see but now you're stopped him

358
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:55,860
do you see but now you're stopped him
 

359
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,490
do you see but now you're stopped him
and now he's not going the other way

360
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,500
and now he's not going the other way
 

361
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,670
and now he's not going the other way
until you make him go the other way that

362
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
until you make him go the other way that
 

363
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,710
until you make him go the other way that
would be incorrect

364
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
would be incorrect
 

365
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,070
would be incorrect
so colloquial Hall is going to pass from

366
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,080
so colloquial Hall is going to pass from
 

367
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,009
so colloquial Hall is going to pass from
the heels to the adhesion

368
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,019
the heels to the adhesion
 

369
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,430
the heels to the adhesion
to this adhesion so this time goes here

to this adhesion so this time goes here
 

371
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:25,030
to this adhesion so this time goes here
and together it moves

372
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040

 

373
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,790

womb this adhesion to this adhesion so

374
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
womb this adhesion to this adhesion so
 

375
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,290
womb this adhesion to this adhesion so
he's not there I don't want to go here

376
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,300
he's not there I don't want to go here
 

377
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,990
he's not there I don't want to go here
but I bring him around and once he

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
stay here our rim bring this adhesion so
 

439
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,650
stay here our rim bring this adhesion so
this adhesion it's bringing him around
