00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
width if you're here like this I haven't
 

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,749
width if you're here like this I haven't
got the width so by turning this foot

8
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
got the width so by turning this foot
 

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,710
got the width so by turning this foot
and turning this like that I turn all of

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:17,720
and turning this like that I turn all of
 

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,150
and turning this like that I turn all of
this so This actually is fitting so

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
this so This actually is fitting so
 

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,189

there's a lot more my we'll say my back

14
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
there's a lot more my we'll say my back
 

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,790

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,790
fitting his belly so that's what I'm
doing I'm giving more of his skin to fit

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
doing I'm giving more of his skin to fit
 

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,270
doing I'm giving more of his skin to fit
more my skin rather than it being a

20
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
more my skin rather than it being a
 

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,549
more my skin rather than it being a
blade against the wide part and that's

22
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
blade against the wide part and that's
 

23
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,229
blade against the wide part and that's
why turn so so almost everybody is

24
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:41,239
why turn so so almost everybody is
 

25
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,750
why turn so so almost everybody is
having this problem where they're going

26
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:42,760
having this problem where they're going
 

27
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,029
having this problem where they're going
in about here they think that's enough

28
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
in about here they think that's enough
 

29
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,950
in about here they think that's enough
but you see it's a thin piece against a

30
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
but you see it's a thin piece against a
 

31
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,750
but you see it's a thin piece against a
wide

32
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:50,760
wide
 

33
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,790
wide
piece so why why you have to motivate

34
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:53,800
piece so why why you have to motivate
 

35
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,910
piece so why why you have to motivate
yourself cuz nobody's going to do it for

36
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
yourself cuz nobody's going to do it for
 

37
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,430

you you have come here you have to spin

38
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
you you have come here you have to spin
 

39
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,389
you you have come here you have to spin
all the way around so now now I don't

40
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:01,399
all the way around so now now I don't
 

41
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,509
all the way around so now now I don't
know if to see there's a lot more now on

42
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:03,519
know if to see there's a lot more now on
 

43
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,710
know if to see there's a lot more now on
my

44
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
my
 

45
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,950
my
back

46
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
back
 

47
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,109
back
on so that's that's basically the the

48
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:10,119
on so that's that's basically the the
 

49
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,149
on so that's that's basically the the
gist of

50
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
gist of
 

51
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,109
gist of
it okay

52
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
it okay
 

53
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,469
it okay
so so until he gets his foot in that

into detail a bit about it but you do

66
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
into detail a bit about it but you do
 

67
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,469
into detail a bit about it but you do
have to I've done this technique for

68
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
have to I've done this technique for
 

69
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,069
have to I've done this technique for
years so I'm a bit Rusty on it but what

70
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
years so I'm a bit Rusty on it but what
 

71
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,030
years so I'm a bit Rusty on it but what
I do now is you've got that or youve got

72
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
I do now is you've got that or youve got
 

73
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,830
I do now is you've got that or youve got
that and you're try to get that the only

74
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
that and you're try to get that the only
 

75
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,550
that and you're try to get that the only
way you can do it is by turning your own

76
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
way you can do it is by turning your own
 

77
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,950
way you can do it is by turning your own
body for that you need that foot to open

78
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
body for that you need that foot to open
 

79
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,630
body for that you need that foot to open
up then you bring them bring him and

80
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
up then you bring them bring him and
 

81
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,310
up then you bring them bring him and
yourself back around and again I was

82
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,320
yourself back around and again I was
 

83
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,550
yourself back around and again I was
saying when I first started tonight

84
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,560
saying when I first started tonight
 

85
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,510
saying when I first started tonight
about

86
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:06,520
about
 

87
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,830
about
flexibility and that's why you need

88
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:08,840
flexibility and that's why you need
 

89
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,510
flexibility and that's why you need
flexibility that's why you need your

90
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,520
flexibility that's why you need your
 

91
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,309
flexibility that's why you need your
yoga you need your stretching you need

92
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
yoga you need your stretching you need
 

93
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,949
yoga you need your stretching you need
your warmups you need to maximize and

00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:15,959
your warmups you need to maximize and
 

95
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,550
your warmups you need to maximize and
find out what your body can achieve not

96
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,560
find out what your body can achieve not
 

97
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,470
find out what your body can achieve not
well this is the best I can do you know

98
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,480
well this is the best I can do you know
 

99
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,229
well this is the best I can do you know
you have to go beyond

100
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
you have to go beyond
 

101
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,150
you have to go beyond
that than

102
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160

 

103
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,910

you one hand one hand I could pull him

104
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
you one hand one hand I could pull him
 

105
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,589
you one hand one hand I could pull him
all night but if I co coordinate this

106
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
all night but if I co coordinate this
 

107
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,390
all night but if I co coordinate this
knee and that that CW then I get it and

108
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:39,400
knee and that that CW then I get it and
 

109
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,910
knee and that that CW then I get it and
I just give a little twist like that so

110
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:42,920
I just give a little twist like that so
 

111
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,390
I just give a little twist like that so
I

112
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
I
 

113
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,670
I
can't if I do it together and then I

114
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
can't if I do it together and then I
 

115
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,630
can't if I do it together and then I
just turn it like that I lock it so as

116
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:49,640
just turn it like that I lock it so as
 

117
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,990
just turn it like that I lock it so as
he tries to come back you lock

118
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000
he tries to come back you lock
 

119
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,589
he tries to come back you lock
it and just try three on each side so

120
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
it and just try three on each side so
 

121
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,149
it and just try three on each side so
try that first and then you can see if

122
00:02:59,149 --> 00:02:59,159
try that first and then you can see if
 

123
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,229
try that first and then you can see if
you can all the way and just it goes

124
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
you can all the way and just it goes
 

125
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,390
you can all the way and just it goes
round it goes

126
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
round it goes
 

127
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,470
round it goes
round away from you okay so here's

128
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
round away from you okay so here's
 

129
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,550
round away from you okay so here's
the we'll say the expansion expansion

130
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
the we'll say the expansion expansion
 

131
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,560
the we'll say the expansion expansion
okay
