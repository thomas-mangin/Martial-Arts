the ability to maintain distance from
someone and the ability to position

00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
someone and the ability to position

good position so those are each
goals and those goals can each be used

34
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
goals and those goals can each be used
 

35
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,430
goals and those goals can each be used
as a tactic

36
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440

now why they're goals so understand that

38
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
now why they're goals so understand that
 

39
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,990
now why they're goals so understand that
in our aikido philosophy

40
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
in our aikido philosophy
 

41
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,670
in our aikido philosophy
we're dealing with a martial art that

42
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
we're dealing with a martial art that
 

43
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,549
we're dealing with a martial art that
has something roughly to do with

44
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
has something roughly to do with
 

45
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,189
has something roughly to do with
um not hurting someone else right so

46
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
um not hurting someone else right so
 

47
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,790
um not hurting someone else right so
that's something that's espoused a lot

48
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
that's something that's espoused a lot
 

49
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,709
that's something that's espoused a lot
in aikido philosophy is that aikido is

50
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
in aikido philosophy is that aikido is
 

51
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,709
in aikido philosophy is that aikido is
not about hurting someone else right

52
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
not about hurting someone else right
 

53
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,229
not about hurting someone else right
something that allows us to defend

54
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
something that allows us to defend
 

55
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,990
something that allows us to defend
ourselves right so meaning that

56
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
ourselves right so meaning that
 

57
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,750
ourselves right so meaning that
not only do i not want to hurt someone

58
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
not only do i not want to hurt someone
 

59
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,869
not only do i not want to hurt someone
else but i have to deal with someone

60
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
else but i have to deal with someone
 

61
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,910
else but i have to deal with someone
else who does

62
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
else who does
 

63
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,910
else who does
probably want to hurt me so how are we

64
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
probably want to hurt me so how are we
 

65
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,750
probably want to hurt me so how are we
going to manage that right

66
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
going to manage that right
 

67
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,310
going to manage that right
and then something that enables me to

68
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
and then something that enables me to
 

69
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,789
and then something that enables me to
use their desire to attack against them

70
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
use their desire to attack against them
 

71
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,789
use their desire to attack against them
and not have to have a lot of force and

72
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
and not have to have a lot of force and
 

73
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,390
and not have to have a lot of force and
power myself right so this is another

74
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
power myself right so this is another
 

75
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,590
power myself right so this is another
big thing in aikido is

76
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
big thing in aikido is
 

77
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,070
big thing in aikido is
that you know a smaller guy is able to

78
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
that you know a smaller guy is able to
 

79
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,070
that you know a smaller guy is able to
deal with a bigger guy or a stronger guy

80
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
deal with a bigger guy or a stronger guy
 

81
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,630
deal with a bigger guy or a stronger guy
or more

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
or more
 

83
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,550
or more
more forceful attacks right and this is

84
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
more forceful attacks right and this is
 

85
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,990
more forceful attacks right and this is
something that a lot of different

86
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
something that a lot of different
 

87
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,510
something that a lot of different
martial arts systems talk about is that

88
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
martial arts systems talk about is that
 

89
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,109
martial arts systems talk about is that
littler people can deal with bigger

90
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
littler people can deal with bigger
 

91
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:29,510
littler people can deal with bigger
people

92
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
people
 

93
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,350
people
but i think aikido does it in a little

94
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
but i think aikido does it in a little
 

95
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,710
but i think aikido does it in a little
bit more of a

96
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
bit more of a
 

97
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,550
bit more of a
general way in a more specific way at

98
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
general way in a more specific way at
 

99
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,149
general way in a more specific way at
the same time right so let's talk about

100
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
the same time right so let's talk about
 

101
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,670
the same time right so let's talk about
those goals and how those goals help us

102
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
those goals and how those goals help us
 

103
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,630
those goals and how those goals help us
achieve that

104
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
achieve that
 

105
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,270
achieve that
so if i am ahead of someone if i'm

106
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
so if i am ahead of someone if i'm
 

107
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,789
so if i am ahead of someone if i'm
mentally ahead of someone

108
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
mentally ahead of someone
 

109
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,870
mentally ahead of someone
then i don't have to take drastic

110
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
then i don't have to take drastic
 

111
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,990
then i don't have to take drastic
actions to

112
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
actions to
 

113
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,230
actions to
take care of myself right so meaning if

that guy is going to go nuts and he's a

118
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
that guy is going to go nuts and he's a

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,709
do something terrible that's the only
way if i got

130
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
way if i got
 

131
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,469
way if i got
in a situation with that guy if i am

132
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
in a situation with that guy if i am
 

133
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,230
in a situation with that guy if i am
mentally ahead like that then i can just

134
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
mentally ahead like that then i can just
 

135
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,950
mentally ahead like that then i can just
choose

136
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
choose
 

137
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,590
choose
not to go there right so that helps me

138
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
not to go there right so that helps me
 

139
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,309
not to go there right so that helps me
achieve

140
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
achieve
 

141
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,389
achieve
all of my aikido philosophy right so if

142
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
all of my aikido philosophy right so if
 

143
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,430
all of my aikido philosophy right so if
i don't go over there and that guy

144
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
i don't go over there and that guy
 

145
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,550
i don't go over there and that guy
doesn't attack me then

146
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
doesn't attack me then
 

147
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,589
doesn't attack me then
i don't hurt him he doesn't hurt me and

148
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
i don't hurt him he doesn't hurt me and
 

149
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,750
i don't hurt him he doesn't hurt me and
essentially he doesn't even have an

150
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
essentially he doesn't even have an
 

151
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,910
essentially he doesn't even have an
attack to use against him

152
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
attack to use against him
 

153
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,350
attack to use against him
so i could be the smallest guy in the

154
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
so i could be the smallest guy in the
 

155
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,190
so i could be the smallest guy in the
world and that will work right so

156
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
world and that will work right so
 

157
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,710
world and that will work right so
i don't have to have a lot of power in

158
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
i don't have to have a lot of power in
 

159
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,070
i don't have to have a lot of power in
order to enact that i just have to be

160
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
order to enact that i just have to be
 

161
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,390
order to enact that i just have to be
aware of what's going on way in advance

162
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
aware of what's going on way in advance
 

163
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,630
aware of what's going on way in advance
now there are times when you're going to

164
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
now there are times when you're going to
 

165
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,509
now there are times when you're going to
have to go

166
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
have to go
 

167
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,190
have to go
into a place where there's potential

168
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
into a place where there's potential
 

169
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,030
into a place where there's potential
danger so you're not always able to

170
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
danger so you're not always able to
 

171
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,150
danger so you're not always able to
avoid potentially dangerous spots so

172
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
avoid potentially dangerous spots so
 

173
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,309
avoid potentially dangerous spots so
mental headedness can go further into

174
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
mental headedness can go further into
 

175
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,190
mental headedness can go further into
that right so

176
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
that right so
 

177
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,030
that right so
you know i know i'm going into a

178
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
you know i know i'm going into a
 

179
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,589
you know i know i'm going into a
dangerous spot but i want to do it in a

180
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
dangerous spot but i want to do it in a
 

181
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,110
dangerous spot but i want to do it in a
way that makes me

182
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
way that makes me
 

183
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,710
way that makes me
not obvious to anyone who would want to

184
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
not obvious to anyone who would want to
 

185
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,110
not obvious to anyone who would want to
attack me or seem friendly to people who

186
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
attack me or seem friendly to people who
 

187
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,309
attack me or seem friendly to people who
would want to attack me

188
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
would want to attack me
 

189
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,630
would want to attack me
or have people with me who would help me

190
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
or have people with me who would help me
 

191
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,910
or have people with me who would help me
in bad situations

192
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
in bad situations
 

193
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,990
in bad situations
or go into it in a defended way so if

194
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
or go into it in a defended way so if
 

195
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,589
or go into it in a defended way so if
someone did attack me it wouldn't turn

196
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
someone did attack me it wouldn't turn
 

197
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,550
someone did attack me it wouldn't turn
out very good for them

198
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
out very good for them
 

199
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,550
out very good for them
so there's again an example of a mental

200
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
so there's again an example of a mental
 

201
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,390
so there's again an example of a mental
headedness i've prepared right we call

202
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
headedness i've prepared right we call
 

203
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,509
headedness i've prepared right we call
this preparation

204
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
this preparation
 

205
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,270
this preparation
i've prepared for what's going to happen

206
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
i've prepared for what's going to happen
 

207
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,630
i've prepared for what's going to happen
over there what could potentially happen

208
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
over there what could potentially happen
 

209
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,030
over there what could potentially happen
over there

210
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
over there
 

211
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,470
over there
so i'm a little bit ahead of the

212
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
so i'm a little bit ahead of the
 

213
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,229
so i'm a little bit ahead of the
situation and then that that

214
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
situation and then that that
 

215
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,070
situation and then that that
headedness falls all the way down to

216
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
headedness falls all the way down to
 

217
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,910
headedness falls all the way down to
what in martial arts is called

218
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
what in martial arts is called
 

219
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,509
what in martial arts is called
senseno sin means to be

220
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
senseno sin means to be
 

221
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,110
senseno sin means to be
in the moment before the moment of

222
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
in the moment before the moment of
 

223
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,350
in the moment before the moment of
attack right so and that is essentially

224
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
attack right so and that is essentially
 

225
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,509
attack right so and that is essentially
if i was uh talking to someone and i can

226
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
if i was uh talking to someone and i can
 

227
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,430
if i was uh talking to someone and i can
tell they're going to hit me in

228
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
tell they're going to hit me in
 

229
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,830
tell they're going to hit me in
one second right and i'm able to act in

230
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
one second right and i'm able to act in
 

231
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,070
one second right and i'm able to act in
that moment before they're able to act

232
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
that moment before they're able to act
 

233
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,390
that moment before they're able to act
and that's the the last headedness that

234
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
and that's the the last headedness that
 

235
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,350
and that's the the last headedness that
we have in aikido

236
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
we have in aikido
 

237
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,990
we have in aikido
and in fact when asked about the timings

238
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
and in fact when asked about the timings
 

239
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,630
and in fact when asked about the timings
of

240
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
of
 

241
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,949
of
martial arts right which are go no sin

242
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
martial arts right which are go no sin
 

243
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,470
martial arts right which are go no sin
to be after the moment

244
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
to be after the moment
 

245
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,350
to be after the moment
send sin to be in the moment and sin and

246
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
send sin to be in the moment and sin and
 

247
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,070
send sin to be in the moment and sin and
no sin to be

248
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
no sin to be
 

249
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,030
no sin to be
before the moment yoshiba said aikido is

250
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
before the moment yoshiba said aikido is
 

251
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,949
before the moment yoshiba said aikido is
none of those things right aikido is not

252
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
none of those things right aikido is not
 

253
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,949
none of those things right aikido is not
any of those because aikido is more than

254
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
any of those because aikido is more than
 

255
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,509
any of those because aikido is more than
that there's

256
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
that there's
 

257
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,589
that there's
something else going on and that in fact

258
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
something else going on and that in fact
 

259
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,670
something else going on and that in fact
aikido victory doesn't happen

260
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
aikido victory doesn't happen
 

261
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,149
aikido victory doesn't happen
in moments it happens instantly it's

262
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
in moments it happens instantly it's
 

263
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,990
in moments it happens instantly it's
already ahead in aikido and i think he's

264
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
already ahead in aikido and i think he's
 

265
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,869
already ahead in aikido and i think he's
alluding to this

266
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
alluding to this
 

267
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,550
alluding to this
being a headedness and so the last

268
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
being a headedness and so the last
 

269
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,149
being a headedness and so the last
aheadness we could have in aikido

270
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
aheadness we could have in aikido
 

271
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,309
aheadness we could have in aikido
would be sensing no sin but but it's

272
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
would be sensing no sin but but it's
 

273
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,550
would be sensing no sin but but it's
actually in in our philosophy

274
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
actually in in our philosophy
 

275
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,110
actually in in our philosophy
kind of still far behind right so ahead

276
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
kind of still far behind right so ahead
 

277
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,070
kind of still far behind right so ahead
over all of what's going

278
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
over all of what's going
 

279
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,830
over all of what's going
on but for iketer not the best and so

280
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
on but for iketer not the best and so
 

281
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,509
on but for iketer not the best and so
that's one of our main goals is to be

282
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
that's one of our main goals is to be
 

283
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:17,990
that's one of our main goals is to be
ahead

284
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
ahead
 

285
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,150
ahead
and you can see how being a head allows

286
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
and you can see how being a head allows
 

287
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,390
and you can see how being a head allows
us to ideally not have to hurt the other

288
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
us to ideally not have to hurt the other
 

289
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,950
us to ideally not have to hurt the other
person

290
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
person
 

291
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,870
person
not get hurt ourselves and not need an

292
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
not get hurt ourselves and not need an
 

293
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,950
not get hurt ourselves and not need an
amazing amount of physical force

294
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
amazing amount of physical force
 

295
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,150
amazing amount of physical force
okay now if we can't manage any of those

296
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
okay now if we can't manage any of those
 

297
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,350
okay now if we can't manage any of those
and there's going to be times where you

298
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
and there's going to be times where you
 

299
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,030
and there's going to be times where you
can't get any of those to happen right

300
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
can't get any of those to happen right
 

301
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,710
can't get any of those to happen right
you get surprised and all kinds of bad

302
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
you get surprised and all kinds of bad
 

303
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,670
you get surprised and all kinds of bad
stuff happen

304
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
stuff happen
 

305
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,749
stuff happen
the next major goal we have is

306
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
the next major goal we have is
 

307
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,790
the next major goal we have is
distancing

308
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
distancing
 

309
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,350
distancing
now distancing again fits in perfectly

310
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
now distancing again fits in perfectly
 

311
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,469
now distancing again fits in perfectly
with our philosophy

312
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
with our philosophy
 

313
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,270
with our philosophy
if i'm really far away from someone well

314
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
if i'm really far away from someone well
 

315
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,950
if i'm really far away from someone well
then it's going to be really hard for

316
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
then it's going to be really hard for
 

317
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,710
then it's going to be really hard for
them to attack me right so

318
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
them to attack me right so
 

319
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,710
them to attack me right so
even if they have projectile weapons it

320
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
even if they have projectile weapons it
 

321
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,230
even if they have projectile weapons it
gets harder and harder the further they

322
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
gets harder and harder the further they
 

323
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,790
gets harder and harder the further they
get away

324
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
get away
 

325
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,550
get away
right so even a really skilled sniper

326
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
right so even a really skilled sniper
 

327
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,390
right so even a really skilled sniper
with a scope and this would be a

328
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
with a scope and this would be a
 

329
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
with a scope and this would be a
a crazy situation but even a really

330
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
a crazy situation but even a really
 

331
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,749
a crazy situation but even a really
skilled sniper with the scope the

332
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
skilled sniper with the scope the
 

333
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,430
skilled sniper with the scope the
further away i get from that guy

334
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
further away i get from that guy
 

335
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,870
further away i get from that guy
the harder it's going to be for him to

336
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
the harder it's going to be for him to
 

337
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,950
the harder it's going to be for him to
get me right so certainly someone

338
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
get me right so certainly someone
 

339
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,469
get me right so certainly someone
without a projectile weapon

340
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
without a projectile weapon
 

341
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,950
without a projectile weapon
the further away i am the safer i am so

342
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
the further away i am the safer i am so
 

343
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,270
the further away i am the safer i am so
um if i can manage to keep a distance

344
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
um if i can manage to keep a distance
 

345
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,230
um if i can manage to keep a distance
uh they i won't have to hurt them um

346
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
uh they i won't have to hurt them um
 

347
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,670
uh they i won't have to hurt them um
they won't be able to hurt me

348
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
they won't be able to hurt me
 

349
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,510
they won't be able to hurt me
and i don't need a lot of physical force

350
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
and i don't need a lot of physical force
 

351
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,950
and i don't need a lot of physical force
right so in fact i need no physical

352
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
right so in fact i need no physical
 

353
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,310
right so in fact i need no physical
force really at a distance

354
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
force really at a distance
 

355
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,070
force really at a distance
now as i keep the distance i might need

356
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
now as i keep the distance i might need
 

357
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,909
now as i keep the distance i might need
to be able to move and all kinds of

358
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
to be able to move and all kinds of
 

359
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,870
to be able to move and all kinds of
stuff like that

360
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
stuff like that
 

361
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,310
stuff like that
and so there is some physicality that

362
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
and so there is some physicality that
 

363
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,150
and so there is some physicality that
might come into play but if i can

364
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
might come into play but if i can
 

365
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,710
might come into play but if i can
achieve

366
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
achieve
 

367
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,430
achieve
distancing then i don't have to worry

368
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
distancing then i don't have to worry
 

369
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,790
distancing then i don't have to worry
about anything else i'm achieving my

370
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
about anything else i'm achieving my
 

371
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,629
about anything else i'm achieving my
aikido philosophy right so i'm doing all

372
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
aikido philosophy right so i'm doing all
 

373
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,310
aikido philosophy right so i'm doing all
the aikido philosophical stuff we talked

374
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
the aikido philosophical stuff we talked
 

375
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,870
the aikido philosophical stuff we talked
about

376
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
about
 

377
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,670
about
and i can use if if i'm mentally ahead i

378
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
and i can use if if i'm mentally ahead i
 

379
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,749
and i can use if if i'm mentally ahead i
can use that to always keep my distance

380
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
can use that to always keep my distance
 

381
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,469
can use that to always keep my distance
and if i get mentally behind i can use

382
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
and if i get mentally behind i can use
 

383
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,270
and if i get mentally behind i can use
distance to reset my mental headedness

384
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
distance to reset my mental headedness
 

385
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,950
distance to reset my mental headedness
right so so meaning if

386
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
right so so meaning if
 

387
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,150
right so so meaning if
there's potentially someone who could

388
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
there's potentially someone who could
 

389
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,749
there's potentially someone who could
surprise me if i always stay away from

390
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
surprise me if i always stay away from
 

391
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,029
surprise me if i always stay away from
them they can't surprise me

392
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
them they can't surprise me
 

393
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,029
them they can't surprise me
too quickly right so meaning if i keep

394
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
too quickly right so meaning if i keep
 

395
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,110
too quickly right so meaning if i keep
at least our basic ma i which is this

396
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
at least our basic ma i which is this
 

397
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,029
at least our basic ma i which is this
arm reach distance they probably can't

398
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
arm reach distance they probably can't
 

399
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,110
arm reach distance they probably can't
hit me before i can have some kind of

400
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
hit me before i can have some kind of
 

401
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,150
hit me before i can have some kind of
reaction to it

402
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
reaction to it
 

403
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,990
reaction to it
and then if i can create more distance i

404
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
and then if i can create more distance i
 

405
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,309
and then if i can create more distance i
can then start to mentally get ahead of

406
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
can then start to mentally get ahead of
 

407
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,150
can then start to mentally get ahead of
them right which is what i want so

408
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
them right which is what i want so
 

409
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,029
them right which is what i want so
so the distancing is a goal that totally

410
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
so the distancing is a goal that totally
 

411
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,070
so the distancing is a goal that totally
in and of itself

412
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
in and of itself
 

413
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,710
in and of itself
lets me achieve my aikido philosophy and

414
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
lets me achieve my aikido philosophy and
 

415
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,550
lets me achieve my aikido philosophy and
also can be used as a tactic

416
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
also can be used as a tactic
 

417
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,309
also can be used as a tactic
to help me get ahead again which is

418
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
to help me get ahead again which is
 

419
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,150
to help me get ahead again which is
another one of my big goals for aikido

420
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
another one of my big goals for aikido
 

421
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,110
another one of my big goals for aikido
philosophy

422
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
philosophy
 

423
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,430
philosophy
now the last of these is superior

424
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
now the last of these is superior
 

425
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,390
now the last of these is superior
positioning

426
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
positioning
 

427
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,390
positioning
now again if i have a really really

428
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
now again if i have a really really
 

429
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,749
now again if i have a really really
great position and a great position

430
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
great position and a great position
 

431
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,629
great position and a great position
could be anything like

432
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
could be anything like
 

433
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,469
could be anything like
you know hiding so no one even knows i'm

434
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
you know hiding so no one even knows i'm
 

435
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,749
you know hiding so no one even knows i'm
there that's a great position

436
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
there that's a great position
 

437
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,350
there that's a great position
or it could be that i'm on top of a

438
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
or it could be that i'm on top of a
 

439
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,710
or it could be that i'm on top of a
mountain and it'd be a lot of work to

440
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
mountain and it'd be a lot of work to
 

441
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,469
mountain and it'd be a lot of work to
get up to me or i'm in a safe room or

442
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
get up to me or i'm in a safe room or
 

443
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,270
get up to me or i'm in a safe room or
all kinds of things

444
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
all kinds of things
 

445
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,790
all kinds of things
or it could be as simple as just being

446
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
or it could be as simple as just being
 

447
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,790
or it could be as simple as just being
behind someone and that's our ideal

448
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
behind someone and that's our ideal
 

449
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,230
behind someone and that's our ideal
simple position in aikido which is the

450
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
simple position in aikido which is the
 

451
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,150
simple position in aikido which is the
eating me position to be behind someone

452
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
eating me position to be behind someone
 

453
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,430
eating me position to be behind someone
now if i can achieve really good

454
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
now if i can achieve really good
 

455
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,990
now if i can achieve really good
position again i can keep them

456
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
position again i can keep them
 

457
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,550
position again i can keep them
from hurting me while i don't have to

458
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
from hurting me while i don't have to
 

459
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,749
from hurting me while i don't have to
hurt them

460
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
hurt them
 

461
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,749
hurt them
and at the same time it doesn't require

462
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
and at the same time it doesn't require
 

463
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,350
and at the same time it doesn't require
a lot of physical force so you see how

464
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
a lot of physical force so you see how
 

465
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,309
a lot of physical force so you see how
again this goal

466
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
again this goal
 

467
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,629
again this goal
beautifully lines up with what my aikido

468
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
beautifully lines up with what my aikido
 

469
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,749
beautifully lines up with what my aikido
philosophy is

470
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
philosophy is
 

471
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,430
philosophy is
and that goal can be used as a tactic

472
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
and that goal can be used as a tactic
 

473
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,350
and that goal can be used as a tactic
to help me with my other ones so let's

474
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
to help me with my other ones so let's
 

475
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,189
to help me with my other ones so let's
say i let the distance get

476
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
say i let the distance get
 

477
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,029
say i let the distance get
all messy and i certainly wasn't ahead

478
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
all messy and i certainly wasn't ahead
 

479
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,270
all messy and i certainly wasn't ahead
of them if i can get myself to the

480
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
of them if i can get myself to the
 

481
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,870
of them if i can get myself to the
to the ideal position the eating me

482
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
to the ideal position the eating me
 

483
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,629
to the ideal position the eating me
position behind them then it's going to

484
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
position behind them then it's going to
 

485
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,550
position behind them then it's going to
be easier for me to distance easier for

486
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
be easier for me to distance easier for
 

487
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,350
be easier for me to distance easier for
me to

488
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
me to
 

489
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,110
me to
make them to dictate to them what they

490
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
make them to dictate to them what they
 

491
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,230
make them to dictate to them what they
have to do right so they have to come

492
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
have to do right so they have to come
 

493
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,909
have to do right so they have to come
around me in some way to get to me

494
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
around me in some way to get to me
 

495
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,070
around me in some way to get to me
