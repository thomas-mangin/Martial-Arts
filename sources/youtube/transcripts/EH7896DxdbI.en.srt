that we see when we often don't talk

66
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:12,869
that we see when we often don't talk

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,020
that we see when we often don't talk
about is it so cold war is returning to

yucky pokey over this rehearsal here and
I turned out and and pop free so we're

00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:26,189
I turned out and and pop free so we're

and another technique we often see an

idea is she will learn and that's a

86
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:35,550
technique done to the inside stuff
 

87
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,020
technique done to the inside stuff
coming inside now it's important to

88
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,030
coming inside now it's important to
 

89
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,730
coming inside now it's important to
understand the techniques do not have a

90
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:40,740
understand the techniques do not have a
 

91
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,710
understand the techniques do not have a
100 percent success rate if any one

92
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
100 percent success rate if any one
 

93
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,910
100 percent success rate if any one
technique had a hundred percent success

94
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
technique had a hundred percent success
 

95
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,980
technique had a hundred percent success
rate when we just do that technique it

96
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:45,990
rate when we just do that technique it
 

97
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,000
rate when we just do that technique it
would be the greatest system in the

98
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,010
would be the greatest system in the
 

99
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,380
would be the greatest system in the
world they look at never defeat us and I

100
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,390
world they look at never defeat us and I
 

101
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,610
world they look at never defeat us and I
do it would be the best and I would say

102
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:49,620
do it would be the best and I would say
 

103
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,960
do it would be the best and I would say
it's great and we know that's not true

104
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
it's great and we know that's not true
 

105
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,600
it's great and we know that's not true
so you have understood techniques have

106
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,610
so you have understood techniques have
 

107
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,330
so you have understood techniques have
failure points if we flow these

108
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,340
failure points if we flow these
 

109
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,700
failure points if we flow these
techniques together we eliminate the

110
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,710
techniques together we eliminate the
 

111
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,990
techniques together we eliminate the
chance that we're going to have zero

112
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
chance that we're going to have zero
 

113
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,420
chance that we're going to have zero
success - what I mean by that is let's

success - what I mean by that is let's
 

115
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,040
