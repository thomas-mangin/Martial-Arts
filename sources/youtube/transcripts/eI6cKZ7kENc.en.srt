13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,179

mental training in Aikido and and what

mental training in Aikido and and what
 

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,560

the mental training is about and I think
 

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,780
the mental training is about and I think
a lot of people get into Aikido because

18
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:35,790
a lot of people get into Aikido because
 

19
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,730
a lot of people get into Aikido because
of the mental aspects of training and

20
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:37,740
of the mental aspects of training and
 

21
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,010
of the mental aspects of training and
that might be more important to a lot of

22
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,020
that might be more important to a lot of
 

23
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,330
that might be more important to a lot of
Aikido students than the physical

24
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,340
Aikido students than the physical
 

25
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,670
Aikido students than the physical

lot in between the physical and the
non-physical in fact the word Ikey could

32
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,590
non-physical in fact the word Ikey could
 

33
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,490
non-physical in fact the word Ikey could
be translated as non-physical harmony

34
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:55,500
be translated as non-physical harmony
 

35
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,740

what it is
 

83
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,450
what it is
and so he is this kind of energy that's

84
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,460
and so he is this kind of energy that's
 

85
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,700
and so he is this kind of energy that's
hard enough to handle hard to get a hold

86
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,710
hard enough to handle hard to get a hold
 

87
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,840
hard enough to handle hard to get a hold
of and I or a hoie say that that kanji

88
00:01:59,840 --> 00:01:59,850

literally a teapot with the lids sitting

92
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
literally a teapot with the lids sitting
 

93
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,469
literally a teapot with the lids sitting
on top of it that's what the kanji

94
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
on top of it that's what the kanji
 

95
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,620
on top of it that's what the kanji
represents and and how that that teapots

energy this abstract weird thing fit

112
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,890
energy this abstract weird thing fit
 

113
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,010
energy this abstract weird thing fit
perfectly and so we're talking about

114
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,020
perfectly and so we're talking about
 

115
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,510
perfectly and so we're talking about
someone else's energy and my energy and

116
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
someone else's energy and my energy and
 

117
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,700
someone else's energy and my energy and
how do we make them fit perfectly so I

118
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:33,710
how do we make them fit perfectly so I
 

119
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,900
how do we make them fit perfectly so I
think a lot of people who want to study
