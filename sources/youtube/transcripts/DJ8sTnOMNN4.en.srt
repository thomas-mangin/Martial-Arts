00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,030

so don't don't lean forward with the way

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
so don't don't lean forward with the way
 

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,509
so don't don't lean forward with the way
on front foot so we're both in a in a

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
on front foot so we're both in a in a
 

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,150
on front foot so we're both in a in a
mutual stance I now bring

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,160

 

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,310

over covers the

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
over covers the
 

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,870
over covers the
about

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880
about
 

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,710
about
releases and LIF and he enters he should

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:27,720
releases and LIF and he enters he should
 

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,950
releases and LIF and he enters he should
feel comfortable he should be 50 on his

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
feel comfortable he should be 50 on his
 

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,549
feel comfortable he should be 50 on his
feet I watch him as he holds me

16
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
feet I watch him as he holds me
 

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,510
feet I watch him as he holds me
off and and then I cut here slightly

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
off and and then I cut here slightly
 

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,950
off and and then I cut here slightly
around this way then this means it will

20
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
around this way then this means it will
 

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,350
around this way then this means it will
cut my whole head

22
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
cut my whole head
 

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,189
cut my whole head
off if we don't do that if I if I Just

24
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:49,199
off if we don't do that if I if I Just
 

25
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,350
off if we don't do that if I if I Just
Step

26
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,360
Step
 

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,630
Step
straight if I Just Step straight this

28
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
straight if I Just Step straight this
 

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,310
straight if I Just Step straight this
what happens and it only

30
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,320
what happens and it only
 

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,869
what happens and it only
mix and this is incorrect so when he

32
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
mix and this is incorrect so when he
 

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,350
mix and this is incorrect so when he
pulls back to the

34
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,360

 

35
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,910

now throws out all all the

36
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:06,920
now throws out all all the
 

37
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,270
now throws out all all the
measurements okay so he releases

38
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280

 

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,149

me

40
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:19,159

 

41
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,550

so so these are the points that are

42
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:21,560
so so these are the points that are
 

43
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,590
so so these are the points that are
important we'll just change

44
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600

 

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,910

camera Okay so

46
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:30,920
camera Okay so
 

47
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,149
camera Okay so
so it doesn't matter who adjusts as long

48
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:33,159
so it doesn't matter who adjusts as long
 

49
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,230
so it doesn't matter who adjusts as long
as we get to this point here okay so I'm

50
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
as we get to this point here okay so I'm
 

51
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,590
as we get to this point here okay so I'm
going to like letting air out of a

52
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
going to like letting air out of a
 

53
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,149
going to like letting air out of a
balloon this is the feeling soft

54
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
balloon this is the feeling soft
 

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,030
balloon this is the feeling soft
sof what's the front foot it it operates

56
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
sof what's the front foot it it operates
 

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,709
sof what's the front foot it it operates
throughout my

58
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:53,719

61
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,910
body it doesn't it doesn't just lift and
then I start step forward I'm connected

62
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
then I start step forward I'm connected
 

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,749
then I start step forward I'm connected
all the way through my

64
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
all the way through my
 

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,070
all the way through my
body comes here and I adjust the back

66
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080

 

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:17,030

foot ijust the ijust

68
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040

 

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,550

the and I

70
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,560
the and I
 

71
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,229
the and I
cut he covers the wrist he releases the

72
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:23,239
cut he covers the wrist he releases the
 

73
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,030
cut he covers the wrist he releases the
wrist I lift and I watch

74
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
wrist I lift and I watch
 

75
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,509
wrist I lift and I watch
him and I watch him and I step slightly

76
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:30,519
him and I watch him and I step slightly
 

77
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,790
him and I watch him and I step slightly
round and that's what makes

78
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
round and that's what makes
 

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,190
round and that's what makes
the the can go through my neck on the on

80
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
the the can go through my neck on the on
 

81
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,030
the the can go through my neck on the on
the swords work when he slides back now

82
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,040
the swords work when he slides back now
 

83
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,430
the swords work when he slides back now
he moves his body not just his arms

84
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
he moves his body not just his arms
 

85
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,990
he moves his body not just his arms
again this needs to be

86
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
again this needs to be
 

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,589
again this needs to be
controlled okay he releases

88
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,599

 

89
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,390

me I he can step back but normally it's

90
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,400
me I he can step back but normally it's
 

91
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,630
me I he can step back but normally it's
a slide back but it might be a big slide

92
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
a slide back but it might be a big slide
 

93
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,430
a slide back but it might be a big slide
back and you get this problem

94
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
back and you get this problem
 

95
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,670
back and you get this problem
so it means in this case he wasn't

96
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
so it means in this case he wasn't
 

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,470
so it means in this case he wasn't
connected um sens sensory wise because

98
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,480
connected um sens sensory wise because
 

99
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,229
connected um sens sensory wise because
if he had have been it would have been

100
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239
if he had have been it would have been
 

101
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,789
if he had have been it would have been
like a piece of

102
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:11,799
like a piece of
 

103
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,750
like a piece of
string it would have been like a piece

104
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
string it would have been like a piece
 

105
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,640
string it would have been like a piece
of string pulling him
