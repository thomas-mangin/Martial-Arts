00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
asking me where's do you have a quad
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,270
asking me where's do you have a quad
drill it's like well the quad is working

10
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
drill it's like well the quad is working
 

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,070
drill it's like well the quad is working
even in the Stillness drills but

12
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,080
even in the Stillness drills but
 

13
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,870
even in the Stillness drills but
definitely in this inward spiral outward

14
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
definitely in this inward spiral outward
 

15
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,390
definitely in this inward spiral outward
spiral drill okay and especially in the

16
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:21,400
spiral drill okay and especially in the
 

17
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,990
spiral drill okay and especially in the
video where you're trying to free the

18
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,000
video where you're trying to free the
 

19
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,589
video where you're trying to free the
shoulder so in that video I mentioned

20
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
shoulder so in that video I mentioned
 

21
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,669
shoulder so in that video I mentioned
how look the look at my midsection it's

22
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:27,679
how look the look at my midsection it's
 

23
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,589
how look the look at my midsection it's
moving well there's there's no way it's

24
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
moving well there's there's no way it's
 

25
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,830
moving well there's there's no way it's
moving if the if the quaw is not moving

26
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
moving if the if the quaw is not moving
 

27
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,709
moving if the if the quaw is not moving
the quaw has to move okay and again for

28
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:35,719
the quaw has to move okay and again for
 

29
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,590
the quaw has to move okay and again for
simple for Simplicity to just start out

30
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:38,600
simple for Simplicity to just start out
 

31
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,709
simple for Simplicity to just start out
I would like for you to think of the qua

32
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
I would like for you to think of the qua
 

33
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,549
I would like for you to think of the qua
as this crease in your pelvis between

34
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
as this crease in your pelvis between
 

35
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,630
as this crease in your pelvis between
your pelvis and your upper thighs and I

36
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:45,640
your pelvis and your upper thighs and I
 

37
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,430
your pelvis and your upper thighs and I
would like for you to think of it it

38
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
would like for you to think of it it
 

39
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,310
would like for you to think of it it
closes on one side and opens the on the

40
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
closes on one side and opens the on the
 

41
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,790
closes on one side and opens the on the
other the crease gets tight and on the

42
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
other the crease gets tight and on the
 

43
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,229
other the crease gets tight and on the
other side the crease will open okay and

44
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
other side the crease will open okay and
 

45
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,910
other side the crease will open okay and
so when you free your

46
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
so when you free your
 

47
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,229
so when you free your
shoulder as the shoulder goes back it I

48
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
shoulder as the shoulder goes back it I
 

49
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,509
shoulder as the shoulder goes back it I
it's not right if my quad on that

50
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
it's not right if my quad on that
 

51
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,030
it's not right if my quad on that
homolateral side does not move with it

52
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,040
homolateral side does not move with it
 

53
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,390
homolateral side does not move with it
so I'm not I don't keep my qua still and

54
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
so I'm not I don't keep my qua still and
 

55
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,429
so I'm not I don't keep my qua still and
I free my shoulder that's that's not

56
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
I free my shoulder that's that's not
 

57
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,390
I free my shoulder that's that's not
what I'm doing

58
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:15,400
what I'm doing
 

59
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,990
what I'm doing
okay the quad on the homolateral side

60
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
okay the quad on the homolateral side
 

61
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,550
okay the quad on the homolateral side
releases just like the shoulder release

62
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,560
releases just like the shoulder release
 

63
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,149
releases just like the shoulder release
so you want to look here forget the arm

64
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:27,159
so you want to look here forget the arm
 

65
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,830
so you want to look here forget the arm
we already went over the arm forget the

66
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
we already went over the arm forget the
 

67
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,069
we already went over the arm forget the
shoulder we already went over the the

68
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
shoulder we already went over the the
 

69
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,550
shoulder we already went over the the
shoulder you want to see

70
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:33,560
shoulder you want to see
 

71
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,910
shoulder you want to see
that with what we did in the arm which I

72
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
that with what we did in the arm which I
 

73
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,870
that with what we did in the arm which I
was doing that whole

74
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:43,880

 

75
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:58,830

even I'll try to keep my other and I

76
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840

 

77
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,590

exaggerate now there's always going to

78
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
exaggerate now there's always going to
 

79
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,709

be in in cooku like we have cooku drills

80
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:05,719
be in in cooku like we have cooku drills
 

81
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,190
be in in cooku like we have cooku drills
and uh there's me

82
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,200
and uh there's me
 

83
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,630
and uh there's me
generating um more positive y so maybe I

84
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
generating um more positive y so maybe I
 

85
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,630
generating um more positive y so maybe I
come forward you see to do it but that's

86
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:15,640
come forward you see to do it but that's
 

87
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,589
come forward you see to do it but that's
not how you use it in in a technique in

88
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
not how you use it in in a technique in
 

89
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,630
not how you use it in in a technique in
a technique he always presses into the

90
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
a technique he always presses into the
 

91
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,270
a technique he always presses into the
positive y so he presses in to the coou

92
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,280
positive y so he presses in to the coou
 

93
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,949
positive y so he presses in to the coou
point okay and so towards that end

94
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:29,959
point okay and so towards that end
 

95
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,470
point okay and so towards that end
there's always a yield I always have to

96
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,480
there's always a yield I always have to
 

97
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,470
there's always a yield I always have to
load the Coq Point okay so it's not that

98
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
load the Coq Point okay so it's not that
 

99
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,869
load the Coq Point okay so it's not that
I'm here and then I push him forward

100
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:41,879
I'm here and then I push him forward
 

101
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,229
I'm here and then I push him forward
like if that's where you're at that's

102
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,239
like if that's where you're at that's
 

103
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,910
like if that's where you're at that's
where you're at okay you're still

104
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
where you're at okay you're still
 

105
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,990
where you're at okay you're still
working the physiological coordination

106
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,000
working the physiological coordination
 

107
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,350
working the physiological coordination
which is important you have to do that

108
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
which is important you have to do that
 

109
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,910
which is important you have to do that
okay but as I go back boom is where he

110
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
okay but as I go back boom is where he
 

111
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,390
okay but as I go back boom is where he
hits the ground path and that's what you

112
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
hits the ground path and that's what you
 

113
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,390
hits the ground path and that's what you
want to learn learn okay so as as we

114
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
want to learn learn okay so as as we
 

115
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,710
want to learn learn okay so as as we
keep

116
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
keep
 

117
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,949
keep
go boom it can make those movements

118
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
go boom it can make those movements
 

119
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,270
go boom it can make those movements
smaller cuz what I'm doing is if like if

120
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
smaller cuz what I'm doing is if like if
 

121
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,309

the Harlem glow Trotters used to get

122
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:13,319
the Harlem glow Trotters used to get
 

123
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,309
the Harlem glow Trotters used to get
that ball and it hit their bicep it's

124
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
that ball and it hit their bicep it's
 

125
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,789
that ball and it hit their bicep it's
it's like that you're loading the ground

126
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:18,799
it's like that you're loading the ground
 

127
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,390
it's like that you're loading the ground
Vector with the yin boom Yin okay and

128
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
Vector with the yin boom Yin okay and
 

129
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,309
Vector with the yin boom Yin okay and
the harder it pushes the hard rate

130
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
the harder it pushes the hard rate
 

131
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,589
the harder it pushes the hard rate
pushes like use all your muscle it just

132
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:26,599
pushes like use all your muscle it just
 

133
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,149
pushes like use all your muscle it just
gets it gets easier because there's more

00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
gets it gets easier because there's more
 

135
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,149
gets it gets easier because there's more
now loow onto the ground top okay it's

136
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
now loow onto the ground top okay it's
 

137
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,229
now loow onto the ground top okay it's
as opposed to if you try if you're doing

138
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
as opposed to if you try if you're doing

it the other way the harder he pushes

140
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
it the other way the harder he pushes
 

141
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,030
it the other way the harder he pushes
the harder that gets okay which is

142
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,040
the harder that gets okay which is
 

143
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,030
the harder that gets okay which is
always a thing like people always say

144
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
always a thing like people always say

what if he really pushed or what if he

146
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
what if he really pushed or what if he
 

147
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,630
what if he really pushed or what if he
really attacked it gets easier okay so

148
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
really attacked it gets easier okay so
 

149
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,830
really attacked it gets easier okay so
you have a couple of ways okay I'll just

150
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:50,840
you have a couple of ways okay I'll just
 

151
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,350
you have a couple of ways okay I'll just
work on freeing the shoulder but also

152
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
work on freeing the shoulder but also
 

153
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,270
work on freeing the shoulder but also
freeing that homolateral crease and

154
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,280
freeing that homolateral crease and
 

155
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,869
freeing that homolateral crease and
bringing it back

156
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
bringing it back
 

157
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,550
bringing it back
you could do that and you should all

158
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,560
you could do that and you should all
 

159
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,789
you could do that and you should all
that is good for you but after you get

160
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
that is good for you but after you get
 

161
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,069
that is good for you but after you get
it you want to think of the loading boom

there and that's it just going to be the

216
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
there and that's it just going to be the
 

217
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,270
there and that's it just going to be the
movement

218
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
