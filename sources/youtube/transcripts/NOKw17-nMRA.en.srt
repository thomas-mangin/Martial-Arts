00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,950

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,789
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about the fundamental

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
going to talk about the fundamental
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,549
going to talk about the fundamental
building blocks of hodoki. So, hodoki

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
building blocks of hodoki. So, hodoki
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,950
building blocks of hodoki. So, hodoki
are the disentanglement techniques.

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
are the disentanglement techniques.
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,310
are the disentanglement techniques.
That's a pretty direct translation of

10
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
That's a pretty direct translation of
 

11
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,190
That's a pretty direct translation of
what it means to disentangle or unmake a

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
what it means to disentangle or unmake a
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,349
what it means to disentangle or unmake a
mess of something that's all bound up.

14
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
mess of something that's all bound up.
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,109
mess of something that's all bound up.
Um, so we're going to do some hodoki

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
Um, so we're going to do some hodoki
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,109
Um, so we're going to do some hodoki
work today with Josh. Josh is back. So,

18
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
work today with Josh. Josh is back. So,
 

19
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,310
work today with Josh. Josh is back. So,
I know you guys will all be super

20
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
I know you guys will all be super
 

21
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,269
I know you guys will all be super
excited. You don't have to deal with

22
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
excited. You don't have to deal with
 

23
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,269
excited. You don't have to deal with
just me. Um, we're gonna get right to

24
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
just me. Um, we're gonna get right to
 

25
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,870
just me. Um, we're gonna get right to
it. Josh, let's go to work.

26
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880

 

27
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,110

All right. So, let's talk about the

28
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
All right. So, let's talk about the
 

29
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,030
All right. So, let's talk about the
fundamental building blocks of hideoki

30
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
fundamental building blocks of hideoki
 

31
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,389
fundamental building blocks of hideoki
and what that is. So, hoki are simply

32
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399
and what that is. So, hoki are simply
 

33
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,750
and what that is. So, hoki are simply
disentanglement techniques. So, get

34
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
disentanglement techniques. So, get
 

35
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,110
disentanglement techniques. So, get
disentangled from whatever you're

36
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
disentangled from whatever you're
 

37
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,350
disentangled from whatever you're
tangled up in. There are two types of

38
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
tangled up in. There are two types of
 

39
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,549
tangled up in. There are two types of
grabs we're going to talk about these

40
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
grabs we're going to talk about these
 

41
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,869
grabs we're going to talk about these
from. One is dodori and do is like the

42
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
from. One is dodori and do is like the
 

43
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,510
from. One is dodori and do is like the
core dori is to grab and that would be a

44
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
core dori is to grab and that would be a
 

45
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,350
core dori is to grab and that would be a
katadori, a munadori, a rioati, an rio

46
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
katadori, a munadori, a rioati, an rio
 

47
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,069
katadori, a munadori, a rioati, an rio
katadori, an edidori, right? So, any of

48
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
katadori, an edidori, right? So, any of
 

49
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,910
katadori, an edidori, right? So, any of
those grabs. All right.

50
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
those grabs. All right.
 

51
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,069
those grabs. All right.
in the body grabs. Basically, what Josh

52
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
in the body grabs. Basically, what Josh
 

53
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,189
in the body grabs. Basically, what Josh
is trying to do is create tension in the

54
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
is trying to do is create tension in the
 

55
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,509
is trying to do is create tension in the
grabbed spot. Right? Now, if I'm

56
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
grabbed spot. Right? Now, if I'm
 

57
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,109
grabbed spot. Right? Now, if I'm
grabbing the core of his body without

58
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
grabbing the core of his body without
 

59
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,550
grabbing the core of his body without
grabbing his fabric, I'm going to have a

60
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
grabbing his fabric, I'm going to have a
 

61
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,469
grabbing his fabric, I'm going to have a
really weak grab. Right? So, Josh just

62
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
really weak grab. Right? So, Josh just
 

63
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,750
really weak grab. Right? So, Josh just
did a triangle from this or an

64
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
did a triangle from this or an
 

65
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,190
did a triangle from this or an
insultiari, whatever he did from this,

66
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
insultiari, whatever he did from this,
 

67
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,350
insultiari, whatever he did from this,
right? It doesn't matter. Um, it's going

68
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
right? It doesn't matter. Um, it's going
 

69
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,550
right? It doesn't matter. Um, it's going
to be really hard for me to hold him

70
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
to be really hard for me to hold him
 

71
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,149
to be really hard for me to hold him
unless I got like big basketball player

72
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
unless I got like big basketball player
 

73
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,390
unless I got like big basketball player
sized hands, right? So, uh, if he just

74
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
sized hands, right? So, uh, if he just
 

75
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,149
sized hands, right? So, uh, if he just
increases the pressure there at that

76
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
increases the pressure there at that
 

77
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,830
increases the pressure there at that
spot, I'm probably going to pop off.

78
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
spot, I'm probably going to pop off.
 

79
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,469
spot, I'm probably going to pop off.
Okay. Now, even if I have a good hold on

80
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
Okay. Now, even if I have a good hold on
 

81
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,749
Okay. Now, even if I have a good hold on
the fabric, if he can make enough

82
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
the fabric, if he can make enough
 

83
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,910
the fabric, if he can make enough
tension on that fabric, he's probably

84
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
tension on that fabric, he's probably
 

85
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,350
tension on that fabric, he's probably
going to pop off, right? So, creating

86
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
going to pop off, right? So, creating
 

87
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,670
going to pop off, right? So, creating
tension at the grab spot is the first

88
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
tension at the grab spot is the first
 

89
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,710
tension at the grab spot is the first
thing you're going to do. You're going

90
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
thing you're going to do. You're going
 

91
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,710
thing you're going to do. You're going
to do that basically by extending out.

92
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
to do that basically by extending out.
 

93
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,390
to do that basically by extending out.
Okay? So, in some way, so let's say I

94
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
Okay? So, in some way, so let's say I
 

95
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,710
Okay? So, in some way, so let's say I
had Joshua Edidiori, right? The basic

96
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
had Joshua Edidiori, right? The basic
 

97
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,310
had Joshua Edidiori, right? The basic
escape he's going to do for this is come

98
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
escape he's going to do for this is come
 

99
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,550
escape he's going to do for this is come
to the outside and create tension at

100
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
to the outside and create tension at
 

101
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,310
to the outside and create tension at
that spot. So, by bringing his hand up

102
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
that spot. So, by bringing his hand up
 

103
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,830
that spot. So, by bringing his hand up
like he's doing and turning on it, he's

104
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
like he's doing and turning on it, he's
 

105
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,510
like he's doing and turning on it, he's
making a ton of tension right there at

106
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
making a ton of tension right there at
 

107
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,950
making a ton of tension right there at
where my grip is, and it's going to be

108
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
where my grip is, and it's going to be
 

109
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
where my grip is, and it's going to be
really, really hard for me to hold him.

110
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
really, really hard for me to hold him.
 

111
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,789
really, really hard for me to hold him.
Okay. Now, he can also do a Timmy with

112
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
Okay. Now, he can also do a Timmy with
 

113
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,789
Okay. Now, he can also do a Timmy with
this, right? So, for example, on the the

114
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
this, right? So, for example, on the the
 

115
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,789
this, right? So, for example, on the the
stoi we just do, he's coming here and

116
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
stoi we just do, he's coming here and
 

117
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,469
stoi we just do, he's coming here and
he's hitting me in the head here. Bang.

118
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
he's hitting me in the head here. Bang.
 

119
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,830
he's hitting me in the head here. Bang.
At the same time, right? So, he's

120
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
At the same time, right? So, he's
 

121
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,990
At the same time, right? So, he's
popping me in the head as well as as

122
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
popping me in the head as well as as
 

123
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,990
popping me in the head as well as as
that. If we were in a cotadori and he

124
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
that. If we were in a cotadori and he
 

125
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,670
that. If we were in a cotadori and he
did a triangle, same thing, right? He's

126
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
did a triangle, same thing, right? He's
 

127
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,830
did a triangle, same thing, right? He's
going to be hitting me. Bang. Okay. Now,

128
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
going to be hitting me. Bang. Okay. Now,
 

129
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,910
going to be hitting me. Bang. Okay. Now,
we're not thinking about the hit in the

130
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
we're not thinking about the hit in the
 

131
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,470
we're not thinking about the hit in the
sense of like it's creating so much

132
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
sense of like it's creating so much
 

133
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,630
sense of like it's creating so much
damage that I go I'm shocked to death

134
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
damage that I go I'm shocked to death
 

135
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,630
damage that I go I'm shocked to death
and I I fall apart or I go to sleep or

136
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
and I I fall apart or I go to sleep or
 

137
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,070
and I I fall apart or I go to sleep or
whatever. And I think when I talk about

138
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
whatever. And I think when I talk about
 

139
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,670
whatever. And I think when I talk about
this, a lot of times people think like I

140
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
this, a lot of times people think like I
 

141
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,430
this, a lot of times people think like I
have some kind of like pacifistic ideas

142
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
have some kind of like pacifistic ideas
 

143
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,750
have some kind of like pacifistic ideas
about it. No, I've just hit people as

144
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
about it. No, I've just hit people as
 

145
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,510
about it. No, I've just hit people as
hard as I possibly can and nothing

146
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
hard as I possibly can and nothing
 

147
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,670
hard as I possibly can and nothing
[\h__\h] happened, right? So you can hit

148
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
[\h__\h] happened, right? So you can hit
 

149
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,390
[\h__\h] happened, right? So you can hit
someone all out, right? And they have no

150
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
someone all out, right? And they have no
 

151
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,350
someone all out, right? And they have no
reaction. And so I think depending upon

152
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
reaction. And so I think depending upon
 

153
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,630
reaction. And so I think depending upon
that reaction is a bad idea, right? So

154
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
that reaction is a bad idea, right? So
 

155
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,710
that reaction is a bad idea, right? So
while the ATM is going to help in that,

156
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
while the ATM is going to help in that,
 

157
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,030
while the ATM is going to help in that,
he's not dependent upon it, but what it

158
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
he's not dependent upon it, but what it
 

159
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,390
he's not dependent upon it, but what it
is really doing is pushing my face even

160
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
is really doing is pushing my face even
 

161
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,710
is really doing is pushing my face even
further away from the action. Right? So

162
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
further away from the action. Right? So
 

163
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,309
further away from the action. Right? So
even if you know I'm a tough guy and he

164
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
even if you know I'm a tough guy and he
 

165
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,750
even if you know I'm a tough guy and he
does that triangle when he starts

166
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
does that triangle when he starts
 

167
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,910
does that triangle when he starts
pushing my face away it gets really

168
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
pushing my face away it gets really
 

169
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,070
pushing my face away it gets really
really hard for me to stay uh in tune

170
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
really hard for me to stay uh in tune
 

171
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,390
really hard for me to stay uh in tune
with Josh right so I can't have much har

172
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
with Josh right so I can't have much har
 

173
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,229
with Josh right so I can't have much har
because my my hand gets separated from

174
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
because my my hand gets separated from
 

175
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,149
because my my hand gets separated from
my body I can't see very well what's

176
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
my body I can't see very well what's
 

177
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,110
my body I can't see very well what's
going on anymore because he's in my face

178
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
going on anymore because he's in my face
 

179
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,869
going on anymore because he's in my face
so that's the quality of it and it's not

180
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
so that's the quality of it and it's not
 

181
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,630
so that's the quality of it and it's not
because like we're pacifists and we

182
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
because like we're pacifists and we
 

183
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,990
because like we're pacifists and we
don't want to hurt someone like I

184
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
don't want to hurt someone like I
 

185
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,589
don't want to hurt someone like I
recommend regularly beating people with

186
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
recommend regularly beating people with
 

187
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,670
recommend regularly beating people with
sticks and blades so like I can't say

188
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
sticks and blades so like I can't say
 

189
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,910
sticks and blades so like I can't say
that I'm a pacifist about these things

190
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
that I'm a pacifist about these things
 

191
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,229
that I'm a pacifist about these things
but um you also can't count on on it

192
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
but um you also can't count on on it
 

193
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,149
but um you also can't count on on it
being amazingly effective, right? Okay.

194
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
being amazingly effective, right? Okay.
 

195
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,470
being amazingly effective, right? Okay.
So, he's going to create tension at the

196
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
So, he's going to create tension at the
 

197
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,110
So, he's going to create tension at the
grab spot. He's going to at Timmy most

198
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
grab spot. He's going to at Timmy most
 

199
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,869
grab spot. He's going to at Timmy most
of the time with this and the Timmy is

200
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
of the time with this and the Timmy is
 

201
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,869
of the time with this and the Timmy is
is how it works out really well. And

202
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
is how it works out really well. And
 

203
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,470
is how it works out really well. And
then if those are failing, he's going to

204
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
then if those are failing, he's going to
 

205
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,670
then if those are failing, he's going to
go into some kind of principal lesson in

206
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
go into some kind of principal lesson in
 

207
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,789
go into some kind of principal lesson in
order to do that, right? So, one of the

208
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
order to do that, right? So, one of the
 

209
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,430
order to do that, right? So, one of the
kiosa. Okay. So, for example, let's say

210
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
kiosa. Okay. So, for example, let's say
 

211
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,309
kiosa. Okay. So, for example, let's say
Josh uh went to a 45 with a little uh a

212
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
Josh uh went to a 45 with a little uh a
 

213
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,550
Josh uh went to a 45 with a little uh a
little pressure, right? Okay. And he

214
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
little pressure, right? Okay. And he
 

215
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,070
little pressure, right? Okay. And he
comes up here like this and now he can't

216
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
comes up here like this and now he can't
 

217
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,229
comes up here like this and now he can't
get me off. If he comes through with Neo

218
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
get me off. If he comes through with Neo
 

219
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,229
get me off. If he comes through with Neo
right here, right? he'll weaken my grip.

220
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
right here, right? he'll weaken my grip.
 

221
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,550
right here, right? he'll weaken my grip.
So basically what all of the wrist

222
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
So basically what all of the wrist
 

223
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,030
So basically what all of the wrist
techniques and iikido do is they create

224
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
techniques and iikido do is they create
 

225
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,509
techniques and iikido do is they create
a weakness in inside the gripping

226
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
a weakness in inside the gripping
 

227
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,949
a weakness in inside the gripping
device. Right? So in the gripping device

228
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
device. Right? So in the gripping device
 

229
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,869
device. Right? So in the gripping device
is my hand, right? So when I'm holding

230
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
is my hand, right? So when I'm holding
 

231
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,630
is my hand, right? So when I'm holding
him, I'm really strong in this

232
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
him, I'm really strong in this
 

233
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,550
him, I'm really strong in this
configuration. Now if you put me in a

234
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
configuration. Now if you put me in a
 

235
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,949
configuration. Now if you put me in a
weaker configuration like the Niko, now

236
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
weaker configuration like the Niko, now
 

237
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,550
weaker configuration like the Niko, now
I'm not nearly as strong because my

238
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm not nearly as strong because my
 

239
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,470
I'm not nearly as strong because my
hands all messed up, right? So like if I

240
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
hands all messed up, right? So like if I
 

241
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,910
hands all messed up, right? So like if I
was going to climb a rope and I climb

242
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
was going to climb a rope and I climb
 

243
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,190
was going to climb a rope and I climb
like this, that's the normal way I'm

244
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
like this, that's the normal way I'm
 

245
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,630
like this, that's the normal way I'm
strong. If I tried to climb the rope

246
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
strong. If I tried to climb the rope
 

247
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,910
strong. If I tried to climb the rope
like this, that's a difficult way,

248
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
like this, that's a difficult way,
 

249
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,030
like this, that's a difficult way,
right? And I wouldn't be nearly as good

250
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
right? And I wouldn't be nearly as good
 

251
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,789
right? And I wouldn't be nearly as good
at climbing rope that way. So, same

252
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
at climbing rope that way. So, same
 

253
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,990
at climbing rope that way. So, same
thing's true with this. He's going to go

254
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
thing's true with this. He's going to go
 

255
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,430
thing's true with this. He's going to go
into one of the principles. Now, on that

256
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
into one of the principles. Now, on that
 

257
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,670
into one of the principles. Now, on that
same 45, he could also go into an eekyo,

258
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
same 45, he could also go into an eekyo,
 

259
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,030
same 45, he could also go into an eekyo,
right? And the eeky, what the eekio is

260
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
right? And the eeky, what the eekio is
 

261
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,070
right? And the eeky, what the eekio is
going to do is it's going to create a

262
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
going to do is it's going to create a
 

263
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,350
going to do is it's going to create a
ton of pressure here, and it's really

264
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
ton of pressure here, and it's really
 

265
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,950
ton of pressure here, and it's really
hard for me to hold on while he's

266
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
hard for me to hold on while he's
 

267
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,390
hard for me to hold on while he's
pushing me in a vulnerable position. So,

268
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
pushing me in a vulnerable position. So,
 

269
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,830
pushing me in a vulnerable position. So,
my arm can't get as strong that way

270
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
my arm can't get as strong that way
 

271
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,749
my arm can't get as strong that way
because my elbows up, so my shoulders in

272
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
because my elbows up, so my shoulders in
 

273
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,590
because my elbows up, so my shoulders in
a weaker position, and it's easy for him

274
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
a weaker position, and it's easy for him
 

275
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,350
a weaker position, and it's easy for him
to pop me off, right? He could do the

276
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
to pop me off, right? He could do the
 

277
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,270
to pop me off, right? He could do the
same thing with, say, a sano. Maybe he's

278
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
same thing with, say, a sano. Maybe he's
 

279
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,189
same thing with, say, a sano. Maybe he's
going to go uchimari for whatever reason

280
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
going to go uchimari for whatever reason
 

281
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,189
going to go uchimari for whatever reason
on this Moro, right? And then when he

282
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
on this Moro, right? And then when he
 

283
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,790
on this Moro, right? And then when he
does that right here, he's got the

284
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
does that right here, he's got the
 

285
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,550
does that right here, he's got the
Sancho and he can use that Sanchko to

286
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
Sancho and he can use that Sanchko to
 

287
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,469
Sancho and he can use that Sanchko to
help clear me off as well. Right? So

288
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
help clear me off as well. Right? So
 

289
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,310
help clear me off as well. Right? So
he's going to A create tension at the

290
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
he's going to A create tension at the
 

291
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,350
he's going to A create tension at the
grab position, b give a Timmy if he can,

292
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
grab position, b give a Timmy if he can,
 

293
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,590
grab position, b give a Timmy if he can,
and and that's part of the elongation of

294
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
and and that's part of the elongation of
 

295
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,150
and and that's part of the elongation of
the the tension process. Then he's going

296
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
the the tension process. Then he's going
 

297
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,310
the the tension process. Then he's going
to apply uh some kind of principal

298
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
to apply uh some kind of principal
 

299
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,070
to apply uh some kind of principal
lesson in order to get me. Those are

300
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
lesson in order to get me. Those are
 

301
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,070
lesson in order to get me. Those are
probably going to either be uh Ekkyo,

302
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
probably going to either be uh Ekkyo,
 

303
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,030
probably going to either be uh Ekkyo,
Nikio, Sanio, could be a Yonko although

304
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,040
Nikio, Sanio, could be a Yonko although
 

305
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,590
Nikio, Sanio, could be a Yonko although
probably not quite as likely, could be a

306
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
probably not quite as likely, could be a
 

307
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,590
probably not quite as likely, could be a
Gokio, although not quite as likely, or

308
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
Gokio, although not quite as likely, or
 

309
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,350
Gokio, although not quite as likely, or
could be a Rokio. Right? So any those

310
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
could be a Rokio. Right? So any those
 

311
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,029
could be a Rokio. Right? So any those
principal lessons are going to make the

312
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
principal lessons are going to make the
 

313
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,629
principal lessons are going to make the
facility or the the thing that I'm using

314
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
facility or the the thing that I'm using
 

315
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,230
facility or the the thing that I'm using
to grab him weaker, and that's going to

316
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
to grab him weaker, and that's going to
 

317
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,830
to grab him weaker, and that's going to
make it easier for him to escape. So

318
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
make it easier for him to escape. So
 

319
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,350
make it easier for him to escape. So
those are his main main ideas. And then

320
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
those are his main main ideas. And then
 

321
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,270
those are his main main ideas. And then
of course, if all those ideas fail, he's

322
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
of course, if all those ideas fail, he's
 

323
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,550
of course, if all those ideas fail, he's
going to immediately go into Conrain.

324
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
going to immediately go into Conrain.
 

325
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,909
going to immediately go into Conrain.
He's going to go in some adaptation,

326
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
He's going to go in some adaptation,
 

327
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,070
He's going to go in some adaptation,
right? So let's say Josh shot a Silto

328
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
right? So let's say Josh shot a Silto
 

329
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,430
right? So let's say Josh shot a Silto
Mari on this, right? Sorry, Silto Morei.

330
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
Mari on this, right? Sorry, Silto Morei.
 

331
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,870
Mari on this, right? Sorry, Silto Morei.
He shot a solorene. He's creating

332
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
He shot a solorene. He's creating
 

333
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,550
He shot a solorene. He's creating
tension here. He's coming around. Now,

334
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
tension here. He's coming around. Now,
 

335
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,070
tension here. He's coming around. Now,
if it doesn't work, he's going to adapt

336
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
if it doesn't work, he's going to adapt
 

337
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,350
if it doesn't work, he's going to adapt
into another one there. He used a

338
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
into another one there. He used a
 

339
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,510
into another one there. He used a
triangle, right? So, so if all of those

340
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
triangle, right? So, so if all of those
 

341
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,870
triangle, right? So, so if all of those
fail, then he's going to immediately go

342
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
fail, then he's going to immediately go
 

343
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,950
fail, then he's going to immediately go
into Conrain and Conrain's um going to

344
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
into Conrain and Conrain's um going to
 

345
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,390
into Conrain and Conrain's um going to
change the situation and hopefully he

346
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
change the situation and hopefully he
 

347
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,070
change the situation and hopefully he
can get free from that situation. Now,

348
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
can get free from that situation. Now,
 

349
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,870
can get free from that situation. Now,
those are all doory, the body dory. The

350
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
those are all doory, the body dory. The
 

351
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,950
those are all doory, the body dory. The
hands are really not that different

352
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
hands are really not that different
 

353
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,110
hands are really not that different
except we're not going to rely upon

354
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
except we're not going to rely upon
 

355
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,749
except we're not going to rely upon
stress as our number one factor. So, the

356
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
stress as our number one factor. So, the
 

357
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,029
stress as our number one factor. So, the
reason for that being, right, if Josh

358
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
reason for that being, right, if Josh
 

359
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,870
reason for that being, right, if Josh
just pulls away from me here, I can

360
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
just pulls away from me here, I can
 

361
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,189
just pulls away from me here, I can
probably keep him, right? Okay. So he

362
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
probably keep him, right? Okay. So he
 

363
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,350
probably keep him, right? Okay. So he
really needs to in this situation create

364
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
really needs to in this situation create
 

365
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,790
really needs to in this situation create
a weakness in my hand right away because

366
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
a weakness in my hand right away because
 

367
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,790
a weakness in my hand right away because
grabbing this is easy for all of us to

368
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
grabbing this is easy for all of us to
 

369
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,469
grabbing this is easy for all of us to
get a hold of. Right? So everyone is

370
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
get a hold of. Right? So everyone is
 

371
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,590
get a hold of. Right? So everyone is
going to be able to hold that really

372
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
going to be able to hold that really
 

373
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,670
going to be able to hold that really
really strong. Right? So creating

374
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
really strong. Right? So creating
 

375
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,430
really strong. Right? So creating
tension here isn't going to work quite

376
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
tension here isn't going to work quite
 

377
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,189
tension here isn't going to work quite
as well. So what he's going to try and

378
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
as well. So what he's going to try and
 

379
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,550
as well. So what he's going to try and
do immediately is start to get one of

380
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
do immediately is start to get one of
 

381
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,710
do immediately is start to get one of
those basic ideas. Now he could nio,

382
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
those basic ideas. Now he could nio,
 

383
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,230
those basic ideas. Now he could nio,
right? He could eek you. He could kash.

384
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
right? He could eek you. He could kash.
 

385
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,309
right? He could eek you. He could kash.
He could Yeah, it's okay. He's Josh is

386
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
He could Yeah, it's okay. He's Josh is
 

387
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,070
He could Yeah, it's okay. He's Josh is
doing his own thing. It's okay. I can

388
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
doing his own thing. It's okay. I can
 

389
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,230
doing his own thing. It's okay. I can
adapt. All right. So, so, uh, he can do

390
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
adapt. All right. So, so, uh, he can do
 

391
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,230
adapt. All right. So, so, uh, he can do
any one of those principal lessons in

392
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
any one of those principal lessons in
 

393
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,150
any one of those principal lessons in
order to pop me off, right? Because what

394
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
order to pop me off, right? Because what
 

395
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,150
order to pop me off, right? Because what
he's doing is he's weakening that grip.

396
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
he's doing is he's weakening that grip.
 

397
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,909
he's doing is he's weakening that grip.
That's what he's doing. And again, of

398
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
That's what he's doing. And again, of
 

399
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,830
That's what he's doing. And again, of
course, if he can use the other hand, he

400
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
course, if he can use the other hand, he
 

401
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,909
course, if he can use the other hand, he
will, right? So, if I had him yak here,

402
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
will, right? So, if I had him yak here,
 

403
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,270
will, right? So, if I had him yak here,
he could come in with a triangle and hit

404
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
he could come in with a triangle and hit
 

405
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,870
he could come in with a triangle and hit
me in the floating ribs. Bang. And

406
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
me in the floating ribs. Bang. And
 

407
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,390
me in the floating ribs. Bang. And
that's more likely to help me let go

408
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
that's more likely to help me let go
 

409
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,070
that's more likely to help me let go
because I'm getting pushed further away

410
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
because I'm getting pushed further away
 

411
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,070
because I'm getting pushed further away
from that spot. So, the Teedori are in a

412
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
from that spot. So, the Teedori are in a
 

413
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,670
from that spot. So, the Teedori are in a
lot of ways harder because they're going

414
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
lot of ways harder because they're going
 

415
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,110
lot of ways harder because they're going
to have a better hold. So you're

416
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
to have a better hold. So you're
 

417
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,950
to have a better hold. So you're
immediately going to start using

418
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
immediately going to start using
 

419
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,629
immediately going to start using
anything from the kilowaza in order to

420
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
anything from the kilowaza in order to
 

421
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,469
anything from the kilowaza in order to
do that. Right? So orchokios can do it.

422
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
do that. Right? So orchokios can do it.
 

423
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,909
do that. Right? So orchokios can do it.
Right? So if I had him yakote and he

424
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
Right? So if I had him yakote and he
 

425
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,629
Right? So if I had him yakote and he
turns so mari here, bang, he's pushing

426
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
turns so mari here, bang, he's pushing
 

427
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,150
turns so mari here, bang, he's pushing
on the back of my elbow and that makes

428
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
on the back of my elbow and that makes
 

429
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,070
on the back of my elbow and that makes
it really really hard for me to to keep

430
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
it really really hard for me to to keep
 

431
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,070
it really really hard for me to to keep
holding on to him. Um and of course if I

432
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
holding on to him. Um and of course if I
 

433
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,510
holding on to him. Um and of course if I
adapted to that, he would adapt right

434
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
adapted to that, he would adapt right
 

435
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,350
adapted to that, he would adapt right
along with me and we'd get a con for it.

436
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
along with me and we'd get a con for it.
 

437
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,110
along with me and we'd get a con for it.
So those are the basic building blocks,

438
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
So those are the basic building blocks,
 

439
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,309
So those are the basic building blocks,
right? You're going to use those all the

440
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
right? You're going to use those all the
 

441
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,670
right? You're going to use those all the
time. If it's a doory, first you're

442
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
time. If it's a doory, first you're
 

443
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,350
time. If it's a doory, first you're
thinking, how do I create pressure? How

444
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
thinking, how do I create pressure? How
 

445
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,029
thinking, how do I create pressure? How
do I create a Timmy? How do I use

446
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
do I create a Timmy? How do I use
 

447
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,189
do I create a Timmy? How do I use
principal lessons? If it's a hand grab,

448
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
principal lessons? If it's a hand grab,
 

449
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,790
principal lessons? If it's a hand grab,
how do I create principal lessons?

450
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
how do I create principal lessons?
 

451
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,029
how do I create principal lessons?
Right? So, uh, and and the tension and

452
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
Right? So, uh, and and the tension and
 

453
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,550
Right? So, uh, and and the tension and
the atimmy also are all in there, but

454
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
the atimmy also are all in there, but
 

455
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,350
the atimmy also are all in there, but
the main thing is you're going to be

456
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
the main thing is you're going to be
 

457
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,550
the main thing is you're going to be
working those principal lessons. Okay?

458
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
working those principal lessons. Okay?
 

459
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,309
working those principal lessons. Okay?
Now, understand all this has to be done

460
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
Now, understand all this has to be done
 

461
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,870
Now, understand all this has to be done
with Tino Hinko. You can't have hideoki

462
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
with Tino Hinko. You can't have hideoki
 

463
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,589
with Tino Hinko. You can't have hideoki
without Tino. So, say we're here and

464
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
without Tino. So, say we're here and
 

465
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,430
without Tino. So, say we're here and
Josh just clears my hand with whatever,

466
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
Josh just clears my hand with whatever,
 

467
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,909
Josh just clears my hand with whatever,
right? I'm still here. So, immediately

468
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
right? I'm still here. So, immediately
 

469
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,990
right? I'm still here. So, immediately
after he clears that, I'm still going to

470
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
after he clears that, I'm still going to
 

471
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,029
after he clears that, I'm still going to
be hitting him, kicking him, grabbing

472
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
be hitting him, kicking him, grabbing
 

473
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,550
be hitting him, kicking him, grabbing
him, whatever I was doing before.

474
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
him, whatever I was doing before.
 

475
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,189
him, whatever I was doing before.
However, if he adds stowari to that, now

476
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
However, if he adds stowari to that, now
 

477
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,710
However, if he adds stowari to that, now
he's in a different position and I have

478
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
he's in a different position and I have
 

479
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,110
he's in a different position and I have
to adapt to him, right? So t or hoki

480
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
to adapt to him, right? So t or hoki
 

481
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,270
to adapt to him, right? So t or hoki
can't happen without tinohinko. So you

482
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
can't happen without tinohinko. So you
 

483
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,189
can't happen without tinohinko. So you
always have to add a tino. Those are the

484
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
always have to add a tino. Those are the
 

485
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,710
always have to add a tino. Those are the
basic six that you've seen before.

486
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
basic six that you've seen before.
 

487
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,390
basic six that you've seen before.
Right? So it's either going to be a 45,

488
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
Right? So it's either going to be a 45,
 

489
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,790
Right? So it's either going to be a 45,
a 90, a triangle, stom, an uchimori, or

490
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
a 90, a triangle, stom, an uchimori, or
 

491
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,309
a 90, a triangle, stom, an uchimori, or
an edimi, right? So those are the basic

492
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
an edimi, right? So those are the basic
 

493
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,510
an edimi, right? So those are the basic
ones we're going to use all the time.

494
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
ones we're going to use all the time.
 

495
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,110
ones we're going to use all the time.
You're always trying to increase your

496
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
You're always trying to increase your
 

497
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,070
You're always trying to increase your
position from muhani, right? Like this

498
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
position from muhani, right? Like this
 

499
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,909
position from muhani, right? Like this
to a better position, right? And the

500
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
to a better position, right? And the
 

501
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,390
to a better position, right? And the
next best position is hani. That's here.

502
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
next best position is hani. That's here.
 

503
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,390
next best position is hani. That's here.
Okay? The next best position is hitoi.

504
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
Okay? The next best position is hitoi.
 

505
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,749
Okay? The next best position is hitoi.
That's here. And the next best position

506
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
That's here. And the next best position
 

507
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,909
That's here. And the next best position
is edi here. So when we're getting those

508
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
is edi here. So when we're getting those
 

509
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,070
is edi here. So when we're getting those
hokei, that's how your line of thinking

510
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
hokei, that's how your line of thinking
 

511
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,869
hokei, that's how your line of thinking
should be going, right? So uh that's it.

512
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
should be going, right? So uh that's it.
 

513
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,390
should be going, right? So uh that's it.
That's that's that's it. Did I miss

514
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
That's that's that's it. Did I miss
 

515
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,629
That's that's that's it. Did I miss
anything? I think I got it all. Okay. So

516
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
anything? I think I got it all. Okay. So
 

517
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,070
anything? I think I got it all. Okay. So
those are the building blocks you use.

518
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
those are the building blocks you use.
 

519
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,510
those are the building blocks you use.
If you want to see some more specific

520
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
If you want to see some more specific
 

521
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,589
If you want to see some more specific
ideas, I'll give them to you. Um if you

522
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
ideas, I'll give them to you. Um if you
 

523
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,509
ideas, I'll give them to you. Um if you
look in the forms, the forms do these

524
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
look in the forms, the forms do these
 

525
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,909
look in the forms, the forms do these
things consistently. So the forms

526
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
things consistently. So the forms
 

527
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,909
things consistently. So the forms
outline all the rules that I just did.

528
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
outline all the rules that I just did.
 

529
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,589
outline all the rules that I just did.
Uh just intuitively you work through

530
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
Uh just intuitively you work through
 

531
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,430
Uh just intuitively you work through
them as you do the forms. So those are

532
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
them as you do the forms. So those are
 

533
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,430
them as you do the forms. So those are
the basic ideas. I'm Christopher Hines,

534
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
the basic ideas. I'm Christopher Hines,
 

535
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,430
the basic ideas. I'm Christopher Hines,
Joshua Tehi. Behind that center cam

536
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
Joshua Tehi. Behind that center cam
 

537
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,509
Joshua Tehi. Behind that center cam
right there is Maya Salana McGown. She

538
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
right there is Maya Salana McGown. She
 

539
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
right there is Maya Salana McGown. She
gave one of these little little waves.
