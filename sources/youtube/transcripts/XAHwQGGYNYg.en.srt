some of the distancing practices she's
 

51
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,700
some of the distancing practices she's
gonna be hard so we have a limited frame

52
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:52,710
gonna be hard so we have a limited frame
 

53
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,770
gonna be hard so we have a limited frame
here so it's gonna be a little contrived

54
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:54,780
here so it's gonna be a little contrived
 

55
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,000
here so it's gonna be a little contrived
but you got to be able to get the idea

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,010
but you got to be able to get the idea
 

57
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,889

do you see the idea of you know - trying

202
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:24,520
do you see the idea of you know - trying
 

203
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,680
do you see the idea of you know - trying
to get a Red Cross expression get a

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,690
to get a Red Cross expression get a
 

205

whole team Josh is training himself to

206
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,340
whole team Josh is training himself to
 

207
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,910
whole team Josh is training himself to
stay out of range and hit her can we can

208
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
stay out of range and hit her can we can
 

209
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,710
stay out of range and hit her can we can
build this up more and more aggressively

210
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720
build this up more and more aggressively
 

211
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,820
build this up more and more aggressively
and ideally what we're going to be doing

212
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:32,830
and ideally what we're going to be doing
 

213
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,220
and ideally what we're going to be doing
is doing it in a three situation where

214
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,230
is doing it in a three situation where
 

215
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,900
is doing it in a three situation where
they can use the hold map we're not

216
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:36,910
they can use the hold map we're not
 

217
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,400
they can use the hold map we're not
gonna have that right now and I can try

00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
him run essentially a little Gio Russell
 

225
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,630
him run essentially a little Gio Russell
right now while josh is working on that

226
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:45,640
right now while josh is working on that
 

227
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:55,559
right now while josh is working on that
weapon

228
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:55,569

 

229
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,640

good job all right so you can see there

230
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:57,650
good job all right so you can see there
 

231
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,110
good job all right so you can see there
he's trying to constantly get out of the

232
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
he's trying to constantly get out of the
 

233
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,059
he's trying to constantly get out of the
way and deal with my in that situation

234
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:01,069
way and deal with my in that situation
 

235
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,309
way and deal with my in that situation
so nice practice for that okay now what

236
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,319
so nice practice for that okay now what
 

237
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,890
so nice practice for that okay now what
we didn't see in that was Maya trying to

238
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:05,900
we didn't see in that was Maya trying to
 

239
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,080
we didn't see in that was Maya trying to
get a hold of the weapon or Josh's arm

240
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,090
get a hold of the weapon or Josh's arm
 

241
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,550

242
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,560
so let's just see what that would look
 

243
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,619
so let's just see what that would look
like in pretend here for a second so

244
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:11,629
like in pretend here for a second so
 

245
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,629
like in pretend here for a second so
Maya comes in Josh goes to swing in mind

checks that hands okay boom she got it
 

249
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,529
checks that hands okay boom she got it
now what we have here is a little bit of

250
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:17,539
now what we have here is a little bit of
 

251
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,420
now what we have here is a little bit of
an awkward but essentially hukka talk

252
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,430
an awkward but essentially hukka talk
 

253
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,860
an awkward but essentially hukka talk
they'd order right this is a real easy

254
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:20,870
they'd order right this is a real easy
 

255
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,779
they'd order right this is a real easy
katate dori four drops to escape so we

256
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:22,789
katate dori four drops to escape so we
 

257
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,700
katate dori four drops to escape so we
have that situation going on now Josh

258
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,710
have that situation going on now Josh
 

259
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,409
have that situation going on now Josh
should be training to get out of this

260
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:26,419
should be training to get out of this
 

261
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,270
should be training to get out of this
and clear the weapon hand okay

and clear the weapon hand okay
there we go I see no good news we're

264
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:30,139
there we go I see no good news we're
 

265
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,589
there we go I see no good news we're
gonna run the drill and if Maya sees the

266
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:32,599

267
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,060
gonna run the drill and if Maya sees the
weapon and he grabbed all the weapon

268
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,070
weapon and he grabbed all the weapon
 

269
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,140
weapon and he grabbed all the weapon
she's gonna grab a hole through the

270
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,150
she's gonna grab a hole through the
 

271
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,740
she's gonna grab a hole through the
weapon

272
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:35,750
weapon
 

273
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:50,240
weapon
ready

274
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,250

 

275
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,480

okay

276
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,490
okay
 

277
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,400
okay
so you can see here a progression that

278
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,410
so you can see here a progression that
 

279
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,960
so you can see here a progression that
we can build with this now of course we

280
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:54,970
we can build with this now of course we
 

281
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,940
we can build with this now of course we
could add two attackers to that or make

282
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:56,950
could add two attackers to that or make
 

283
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,800
could add two attackers to that or make
it more confined space there's all kinds

284
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:58,810
it more confined space there's all kinds
 

285
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,210
it more confined space there's all kinds
of criteria we can use to build that up

286
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,220
of criteria we can use to build that up
 

287
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,980
of criteria we can use to build that up
but the idea is that you giving each

288
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:01,990
but the idea is that you giving each
 

289
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,350
but the idea is that you giving each
other get both of them win criteria

290
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,360
other get both of them win criteria
 

291
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,150
other get both of them win criteria
mines win criteria you know holds ajosh

292
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
mines win criteria you know holds ajosh
 

293
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,650
mines win criteria you know holds ajosh
in a way that you can't use that weapon

294
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:07,660
in a way that you can't use that weapon
 

295
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,710
in a way that you can't use that weapon
Jobs's win criteria simply stay free use

296
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
Jobs's win criteria simply stay free use
 

297
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
Jobs's win criteria simply stay free use
that weapon as much as possible

298
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,250
that weapon as much as possible
 

299
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,090
that weapon as much as possible
this falls in line with our Aikido ideas

300
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,100
this falls in line with our Aikido ideas
 

301
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,980
this falls in line with our Aikido ideas
and we'll train this to use I knew as a

302
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:16,990
and we'll train this to use I knew as a
 

303
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,810
and we'll train this to use I knew as a
martial art instead of using some other

304
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:18,820
martial art instead of using some other
 

305
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,970
martial art instead of using some other
system right so if I'm training some

306
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:20,980
system right so if I'm training some
 

307
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,920
system right so if I'm training some
kind of wrestling system and she comes

308
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:22,930
kind of wrestling system and she comes
 

309
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,090
kind of wrestling system and she comes
in there might be it might be this Oh

310
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,100
in there might be it might be this Oh
 

311
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,070
in there might be it might be this Oh
God right I know I did a rimi nage there

God right I know I did a rimi nage there
 

313
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,440
God right I know I did a rimi nage there
so that was really Aikido but I ignored

314
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,450
so that was really Aikido but I ignored
 

315
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,720
so that was really Aikido but I ignored
all the other ideas of Aikido when she

316
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:33,730
all the other ideas of Aikido when she
 

317
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,190
all the other ideas of Aikido when she
comes in I want to be able to keep

318
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,200
comes in I want to be able to keep
 

319
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,470
comes in I want to be able to keep
distance manage my I use my weapon it's
