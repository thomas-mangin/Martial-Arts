1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,570

all right on kihon was a

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:05,580
all right on kihon was a
 

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,250
all right on kihon was a
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,260
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa
 

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,249
and we're just talking about kihon Wasa
um

6
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:13,259

 

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,950

it's like a shape

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
it's like a shape
 

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,790
it's like a shape
and you want to

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
and you want to
 

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,670
and you want to
replicate the shape

12
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,680

 

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,990

from there you work with your teacher to

14
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,000
from there you work with your teacher to
 

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,109
from there you work with your teacher to
understand the shape

16
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
understand the shape
 

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,210
understand the shape
use the shape

18
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,220
use the shape
 

19
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,850
use the shape
Etc so let's just start with the shape

20
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:37,860

 

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,650

first thing is

22
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:39,660
first thing is
 

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,750
first thing is
going to be hand shaped

24
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760

 

25
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,930

the hand is going to

26
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:47,940
the hand is going to
 

27
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,110
the hand is going to
have a cup

28
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
have a cup
 

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,410
have a cup
aspect to your palm

30
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:54,420
aspect to your palm
 

31
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,869
aspect to your palm
but that is not made by

32
00:00:59,869 --> 00:00:59,879

 

33
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,189

squeezing your bones in like this

34
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
squeezing your bones in like this
 

35
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,649
squeezing your bones in like this
what you don't want on the Other Extreme

36
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:06,659
what you don't want on the Other Extreme
 

37
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,590
what you don't want on the Other Extreme
however is the bones of the hand uh

38
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
however is the bones of the hand uh
 

39
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,370
however is the bones of the hand uh
extending

40
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,380
extending
 

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,289
extending
like this this is not correct okay

42
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:18,299

 

43
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:18,950

um

44
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
um
 

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,649
um
you have this cup shape to it

46
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
you have this cup shape to it
 

47
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,130
you have this cup shape to it
but not made by you'll see some people

48
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,140
but not made by you'll see some people
 

49
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,590
but not made by you'll see some people
doing this stuff okay

50
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
doing this stuff okay
 

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,130
doing this stuff okay
or you'll see some people in extension

52
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,140
or you'll see some people in extension
 

53
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,810
or you'll see some people in extension
doing that other mistake okay

54
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:35,820

 

55
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,410

again this is the kihon was a shape and

56
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,420
again this is the kihon was a shape and
 

57
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,890
again this is the kihon was a shape and
as kihonawasa is to be transcended

58
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:41,900
as kihonawasa is to be transcended
 

59
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,510
as kihonawasa is to be transcended
ultimately the shape is not important

60
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
ultimately the shape is not important
 

61
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,569
ultimately the shape is not important
but whenever you're training in

62
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:46,579
but whenever you're training in
 

63
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,030
but whenever you're training in
kihonawaza you should do the shape and

64
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
kihonawaza you should do the shape and
 

65
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,030
kihonawaza you should do the shape and
if you don't have the shape yet you

66
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
if you don't have the shape yet you
 

67
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,830
if you don't have the shape yet you
should learn the shape so there's a cup

68
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
should learn the shape so there's a cup
 

69
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,090
should learn the shape so there's a cup
aspect to the palm

70
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,100
aspect to the palm
 

71
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,690
aspect to the palm
then your fingers are

72
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:04,700
then your fingers are
 

73
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,510
then your fingers are
long but not tense

74
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
long but not tense
 

75
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,790
long but not tense
if you tense your fingers you're going

76
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
if you tense your fingers you're going
 

77
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,650
if you tense your fingers you're going
to tend to make that first mistake

78
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:12,660
to tend to make that first mistake
 

79
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,830
to tend to make that first mistake
you'll sympathetically tense the bones

80
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
you'll sympathetically tense the bones
 

81
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,570
you'll sympathetically tense the bones
in your hand okay

82
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:17,580
in your hand okay
 

83
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,510
in your hand okay
okay so my fingers are long

84
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,520
okay so my fingers are long
 

85
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,550
okay so my fingers are long
and I'll give little points as we go

86
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
and I'll give little points as we go
 

87
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,990
and I'll give little points as we go
along here

88
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
along here
 

89
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,630
along here
in the beginning

90
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,640
in the beginning
 

91
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,110
in the beginning
uh you want to have that cup in your

92
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
uh you want to have that cup in your
 

93
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,070
uh you want to have that cup in your
palm

94
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
palm
 

95
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,990
palm
in alignment

96
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
in alignment
 

97
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,410
in alignment
with your forearm bones to your elbow

98
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,420
with your forearm bones to your elbow
 

99
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,070
with your forearm bones to your elbow
so you don't want it here

100
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
so you don't want it here
 

101
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,770
so you don't want it here
this way

102
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
this way
 

103
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,009
this way
and then pay attention to this middle

104
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:46,019
and then pay attention to this middle
 

105
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,270
and then pay attention to this middle
finger

106
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
finger
 

107
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,550
finger
this finger here

108
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
this finger here
 

109
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,369
this finger here
and I would actually say a point here

110
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:52,379
and I would actually say a point here
 

111
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,630
and I would actually say a point here
between the middle and the ring

112
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
between the middle and the ring
 

113
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,190
between the middle and the ring
are

114
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
are
 

115
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,610
are
connected to that Palm

116
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
connected to that Palm
 

117
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,770
connected to that Palm
okay again don't

118
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:03,780
okay again don't
 

119
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,729
okay again don't
flex your fingers but keep them long

120
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:07,739
flex your fingers but keep them long
 

121
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,270
flex your fingers but keep them long
and as you get this hand shape

122
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
and as you get this hand shape
 

123
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,670
and as you get this hand shape
keep your forearm

124
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
keep your forearm
 

125
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,170
keep your forearm
relax

126
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
relax
 

127
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,410
relax
not it's not made by a tension in your

128
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
not it's not made by a tension in your
 

129
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,229
not it's not made by a tension in your
in your arms your forearm is very

130
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:21,239
in your arms your forearm is very
 

131
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,890
in your arms your forearm is very
relaxed okay

132
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:24,900

 

133
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,869

shape of the head

134
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:29,879

 

135
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,790

the next shape

136
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:31,800
the next shape
 

137
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,030
the next shape
is the arm

138
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
is the arm
 

139
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,190
is the arm
and I'll give you a reference point here

140
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
and I'll give you a reference point here
 

141
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,550
and I'll give you a reference point here
there's only two R movements they're

142
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
there's only two R movements they're
 

143
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,130
there's only two R movements they're
really one movement so it's playing with

144
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,140
really one movement so it's playing with
 

145
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,949
really one movement so it's playing with
that uh duality

146
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:47,959

 

147
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,670

in place of a Unity you're you're

148
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
in place of a Unity you're you're
 

149
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,530
in place of a Unity you're you're
working through yin and yang back to the

150
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,540
working through yin and yang back to the
 

151
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,170
working through yin and yang back to the
Dao so there's two but ultimately

152
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180
Dao so there's two but ultimately
 

153
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,330
Dao so there's two but ultimately
there's one okay

154
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,340
there's one okay
 

155
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,570
there's one okay
uh one we'll call the inward the inward

156
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
uh one we'll call the inward the inward
 

157
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,890
uh one we'll call the inward the inward
spiral

158
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:03,900
spiral
 

159
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,610
spiral
and the other one is the outward spiral

160
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,620
and the other one is the outward spiral
 

161
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,289
and the other one is the outward spiral
okay

162
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:09,299
okay
 

163
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,369
okay
so I take that hand shape

164
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:12,379
so I take that hand shape
 

165
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,490
so I take that hand shape
and my hand goes this way and of course

166
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,500
and my hand goes this way and of course
 

167
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,590
and my hand goes this way and of course
it can do the reverse

168
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
it can do the reverse
 

169
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,969
it can do the reverse
this is we'll call the inward spiral

170
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:25,979

 

171
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,450

the hour spiral is just an extension of

172
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,460
the hour spiral is just an extension of
 

173
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,270
the hour spiral is just an extension of
its reverse

174
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280

 

175
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,689

and then an inversion of it

176
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:35,699
and then an inversion of it
 

177
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,490
and then an inversion of it

how about my elbow
 

249
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,670
how about my elbow
starts on that shoulder line and when I

250
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
starts on that shoulder line and when I

the way to that middle line
 

255
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,090
the way to that middle line
and that is where uh you'll you're going

256
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,100
and that is where uh you'll you're going
 

257
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,249
and that is where uh you'll you're going
to see that it'll have its yin and yang

00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,259
to see that it'll have its yin and yang
 

259
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,010
to see that it'll have its yin and yang
phases so as it's moving from the

phases so as it's moving from the
 

261
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,490

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,749
the completion of the center line it is
done it can't go anymore

the forearm is relaxed as it is but it
 

285
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,550
the forearm is relaxed as it is but it
is the elbow that's actually tracing

286
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
is the elbow that's actually tracing

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,409
is the elbow that's actually tracing

289
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,129

um

290
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,139
um
 

291
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,110
um
for the outward

292
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
for the outward
 

293
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,930
for the outward
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral

294
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:11,940
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral
 

295
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,790
uh the outward elbow or the outer spiral
uh it's going to cross over okay so down

296
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
uh it's going to cross over okay so down
 

297
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,790
uh it's going to cross over okay so down
it'll reach that midpoint and then come

298
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:19,800
it'll reach that midpoint and then come
 

299
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,450
it'll reach that midpoint and then come
back to the shoulder line okay not not

300
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
back to the shoulder line okay not not
 

301
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,950
back to the shoulder line okay not not
way out here

302
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
way out here

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,589
way out here
back to the shoulder one

304
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
back to the shoulder one
 

305
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,050
back to the shoulder one
a pattern you can keep in mind is that

306
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,060
a pattern you can keep in mind is that
 

307
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,770
a pattern you can keep in mind is that
they make hearts they make a heart

308
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
they make hearts they make a heart
 

309
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,110
they make hearts they make a heart
so if you look at our Crest in the back

310
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
so if you look at our Crest in the back
 

311
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,790
so if you look at our Crest in the back
of the crest you have a universal

312
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
of the crest you have a universal
 

313
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,770
of the crest you have a universal
pattern and in the middle of the

314
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:39,780
pattern and in the middle of the
 

315
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,170
pattern and in the middle of the
universal pattern is a heart shape so

316
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,180
universal pattern is a heart shape so
 

317
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,930
universal pattern is a heart shape so
you can kind of use that as long as you

318
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
you can kind of use that as long as you
 

319
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,749
you can kind of use that as long as you
remember that it's not the hand tracing

320
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
remember that it's not the hand tracing
 

321
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,290
remember that it's not the hand tracing
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow

322
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:51,300
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow
 

323
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,909
it it's the elbow tracing it the elbow
is tracing

324
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919

 

325
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,809

so take the hand shape and the arm shape

326
00:07:59,809 --> 00:07:59,819
so take the hand shape and the arm shape
 

327
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,430
so take the hand shape and the arm shape
and in kihon was a there's never going

328
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,440
and in kihon was a there's never going
 

329
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,749
and in kihon was a there's never going
to be

330
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
to be
 

331
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,930
to be
uh one side of your body that is making

332
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:08,940
uh one side of your body that is making
 

333
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,129
uh one side of your body that is making
the shapes and the other one's not okay

334
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:12,139
the shapes and the other one's not okay
 

335
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,029
the shapes and the other one's not okay
so for example uh I wouldn't have this

336
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
so for example uh I wouldn't have this
 

337
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,089
so for example uh I wouldn't have this
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so

338
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:20,099
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so
 

339
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,189
arm ever hanging or this arm hanging so
this one's in the shape and this arm is

340
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199
this one's in the shape and this arm is
 

341
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,430
this one's in the shape and this arm is
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes

342
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes
 

343
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,330
doing nothing it's very relaxed comes
around and then does this I keep the

shapes at all times keep the shapes at
 

347
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,690
shapes at all times keep the shapes at
all times so bodies in the shape

they're still in the shape
 

353
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,769
they're still in the shape
and they're gonna make

354
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:42,779
and they're gonna make
 

355
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,130
and they're gonna make
uh the two shapes together

356
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,140
uh the two shapes together
 

357
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,530
uh the two shapes together
as opposed to

367
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,050

you'll see the inward spiral and the

368
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,060
you'll see the inward spiral and the
 

369
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,329
you'll see the inward spiral and the
outward spiral on this hand

370
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:05,339
outward spiral on this hand
 

371
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,290
outward spiral on this hand
from

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,180
for the camera
 

383
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,210
for the camera
starting to go

384
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,220
starting to go
 

385
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,690
starting to go
so this hand is starting outward this

386
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:26,700
so this hand is starting outward this
 

387
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,910
so this hand is starting outward this
hand is technically starting Inward and

388
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:28,920
hand is technically starting Inward and
 

389
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,250
hand is technically starting Inward and
it's because it's yin yang but then they

390
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,260
it's because it's yin yang but then they
 

391
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,070
it's because it's yin yang but then they
switch so inward goes to outward outward

392
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
switch so inward goes to outward outward
 

393
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,690
switch so inward goes to outward outward
goes to inward

394
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:35,700
goes to inward
 

395
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,670
goes to inward
go here

396
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680

all right so a good drill on working on
 

419
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,750
all right so a good drill on working on
those hand shapes and arm patterns is

those hand shapes and arm patterns is
 

421
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,910
those hand shapes and arm patterns is
the following so I call this a micro

drill so your Keyhole Wasa are drills
 

425
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,530
drill so your Keyhole Wasa are drills
and we're going to take the hand shape

426
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:24,540
and we're going to take the hand shape
 

427
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,130
and we're going to take the hand shape
and the arm shapes and the sense that

and the arm shapes and the sense that
 

429
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,530
and the arm shapes and the sense that
both sides are working

430

both sides are working
 

431
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,170
both sides are working
and make a micro drill just out of those

432
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,180
and make a micro drill just out of those
 

433
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,490

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:39,740
you do the inner spiral
 

437
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,829
you do the inner spiral

at first

480
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,260
at first
 

481
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,550
at first
at first you're going to flex everything

482
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,560
at first you're going to flex everything
 

483
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,670
at first you're going to flex everything
uh that is fine

484
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,680
uh that is fine
 

485
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,889
uh that is fine
just remember

486
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:36,899
just remember
 

487
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,370
just remember
that as you progress

488
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,380
that as you progress
 

489
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,329
that as you progress
you should not be using any effort to

490
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:44,339
you should not be using any effort to
 

491
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,310
you should not be using any effort to
accomplish the same means

492
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
accomplish the same means
 

493
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,230
accomplish the same means
okay uh so at first

494
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240
okay uh so at first
 

495
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,690
okay uh so at first
you're going to think it's biomechanical

496
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,700
you're going to think it's biomechanical
 

497
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,129
you're going to think it's biomechanical
and skeletal alignment which is fine but

498
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:58,139
and skeletal alignment which is fine but
 

499
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,550
and skeletal alignment which is fine but
always task yourself with no it's not

500
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,560
always task yourself with no it's not
 

501
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,009
always task yourself with no it's not
okay

502
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,019
okay
 

503
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:08,030
okay
uh so uh as we're here in this this

504
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
uh so uh as we're here in this this
 

505
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,750
uh so uh as we're here in this this
thing again

506

507
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,829

the egoic minds see skeletal alignment

508
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
the egoic minds see skeletal alignment
 

509
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,129
the egoic minds see skeletal alignment
do you see and uh they're like well yeah

510
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:19,139
do you see and uh they're like well yeah
 

511
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,329
do you see and uh they're like well yeah
she can't she can't push you or you're

512
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:23,339
she can't she can't push you or you're
 

513
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,990
she can't she can't push you or you're
making her energy come up uh so she

514
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,000
making her energy come up uh so she
 

515
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,170
making her energy come up uh so she
can't get a line on you

516
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,180
can't get a line on you
 

517
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,930
can't get a line on you
um if she really tried she she'd push

518
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
um if she really tried she she'd push
 

519
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,509
um if she really tried she she'd push
you over but no the energy goes back

520
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
you over but no the energy goes back
 

521
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,670
you over but no the energy goes back
into her okay and you could do whatever

522
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
into her okay and you could do whatever
 

523
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,590
into her okay and you could do whatever
she could stand up

524
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
she could stand up
 

525
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,050
she could stand up
and she could push so here you can't say

526
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,060
and she could push so here you can't say
 

527
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,230
and she could push so here you can't say
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't

528
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't
 

529
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,050
I'm underneath it okay and it doesn't
matter that's not what's happening okay

as I do the pattern
 

535
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,750
as I do the pattern
let me just make this shade okay so for

536
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:56,760
let me just make this shade okay so for
 

537
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,069
let me just make this shade okay so for
example

538
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
example
 

539
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,569
example
uh you can change where she's at nope

540
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:02,579
uh you can change where she's at nope
 

541
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,310
uh you can change where she's at nope
uh

542
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
uh
 

543
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,650
uh
everyone might understand that she can't

544
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,660
everyone might understand that she can't
 

545
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,389
everyone might understand that she can't
push so well that way biomechanically

546
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
push so well that way biomechanically
 

547
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,210
push so well that way biomechanically
but if she stands up

548
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
but if she stands up
 

549
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,430
but if she stands up
and she's pushing on the elbow again

550
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:16,440
and she's pushing on the elbow again
 

551
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,190
and she's pushing on the elbow again
nothing happens but at the same time she

552
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,200
nothing happens but at the same time she
 

553
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,069
nothing happens but at the same time she
can't she can't push on the hand she

554
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
can't she can't push on the hand she
 

555
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,230
can't she can't push on the hand she
can't push on the hand that way either

556
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
can't push on the hand that way either
 

557
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,210
can't push on the hand that way either
you see normally you would think that

558
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,220
you see normally you would think that
 

559
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,490
you see normally you would think that
would collapse or you would think the

560
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
would collapse or you would think the
 

561
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,310
would collapse or you would think the
elbow would push down or something or as

562
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
elbow would push down or something or as
 

563
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,449
elbow would push down or something or as
she comes from this angle on the elbow

564
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:34,459
she comes from this angle on the elbow
 

565
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,190
she comes from this angle on the elbow
she can't push the elbow that way either

566
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,200
she can't push the elbow that way either
 

567
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,690
she can't push the elbow that way either
okay

568
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:38,700
okay
 

569
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,329
okay
and you can see that I'm still relaxed

570
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:41,339
and you can see that I'm still relaxed
 

571
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,990
and you can see that I'm still relaxed
but at the beginning it's fine

572
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,000
but at the beginning it's fine
 

573
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,810
but at the beginning it's fine
over tense what I would say

574
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:47,820
over tense what I would say
 

575
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,550
over tense what I would say
and uh

576
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:49,560
and uh
 

577
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,889
and uh
but continually

578
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:51,899
but continually
 

579
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,069
but continually
trust and gain faith in taking tension

580
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:55,079
trust and gain faith in taking tension
 

581
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,189
trust and gain faith in taking tension
while keeping the shapes that's your

582
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,199
while keeping the shapes that's your
 

583
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,250
while keeping the shapes that's your
goal get the shape and then keep the

584
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,260
goal get the shape and then keep the
 

585
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,750
goal get the shape and then keep the
shape as you take away more and more uh

586
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
shape as you take away more and more uh
 

587
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,449
shape as you take away more and more uh
mechanical thinking and more and more

588
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,459
mechanical thinking and more and more
 

589
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,790
mechanical thinking and more and more
muscle tension

590
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:13,800

 

591
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,449

so it looks like these shapes you're

592
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:17,459
so it looks like these shapes you're
 

593
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,490
so it looks like these shapes you're
going to need more shapes

594
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:19,500
going to need more shapes
 

595
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,650
going to need more shapes
to do your Aikido

596
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:21,660
to do your Aikido
 

597
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,350
to do your Aikido
so you're like where's my where's my up

598
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,360
so you're like where's my where's my up
 

599
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,470
so you're like where's my where's my up
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in

600
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,480
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in
 

601
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,329
and down uh robot arms yeah it's not in
the art don't it's not in the keyhole

602
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:29,339
the art don't it's not in the keyhole
 

603
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,449
the art don't it's not in the keyhole
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh

604
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:32,459
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh
 

605
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,269
don't do it in the keyhole okay uh
where's my my inward outward Perry wax

606
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
where's my my inward outward Perry wax
 

607
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,850
where's my my inward outward Perry wax
sound wax off it's not in the art okay

608
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:37,860
sound wax off it's not in the art okay
 

609
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,509
sound wax off it's not in the art okay
so with these with these two spirals

610
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
so with these with these two spirals
 

611
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,110
so with these with these two spirals
with this heart-shaped spiral

612
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
with this heart-shaped spiral
 

613
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,829
with this heart-shaped spiral
um

614
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
um
 

615
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,850
um
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki

616
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:49,860
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki
 

617
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,269
in combination with your uh Ashi sabaki
and your Thai sabaki you generate

618
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
and your Thai sabaki you generate
 

619
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,389
and your Thai sabaki you generate
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow

620
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow
 

621
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,490
whatever you wanted to do with the elbow
band or whatever you wanted to do with

622
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,500
band or whatever you wanted to do with
 

623
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,009
band or whatever you wanted to do with
the robot arms or the wax all wax off

624
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:01,019
the robot arms or the wax all wax off
 

625
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,710
the robot arms or the wax all wax off
okay

626
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
okay
 

627
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,290
okay
um so keep that in mind that I have to I

628
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:06,300
um so keep that in mind that I have to I
 

629
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,050
um so keep that in mind that I have to I
can only do these shapes I can only do

630
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,060
can only do these shapes I can only do
 

631
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,170
can only do these shapes I can only do
these two Spirals and then I have to

632
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,180
these two Spirals and then I have to
 

633
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,050
these two Spirals and then I have to
make up whatever I want with how I move

634
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,060
make up whatever I want with how I move
 

635
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,970
make up whatever I want with how I move
my body and how I move my feet okay

636
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:19,980
my body and how I move my feet okay
 

637
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,090
my body and how I move my feet okay
all right shape

638
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,100
all right shape
 

639
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,629
all right shape
there is a shape to the waza and it too

640
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:29,639
there is a shape to the waza and it too
 

641
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,530
there is a shape to the waza and it too
is going to be the spiral in nature uh

642
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:33,540
is going to be the spiral in nature uh
 

643
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,930
is going to be the spiral in nature uh
and when we say spiral you don't want to

644
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:35,940
and when we say spiral you don't want to
 

645
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,050
and when we say spiral you don't want to
think two-dimensional uh nothing is

646
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,060
think two-dimensional uh nothing is
 

647
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,310
think two-dimensional uh nothing is
two-dimensional in kihonawaza so

648
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:43,320
two-dimensional in kihonawaza so
 

649
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,870
two-dimensional in kihonawaza so
um

650
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
um
 

651
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,150
um
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a

652
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a
 

653
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,730
it's not a x y grid but it's also not a
two-dimensional spiral okay so for

654
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,740
two-dimensional spiral okay so for
 

655
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,170
two-dimensional spiral okay so for
example uh the technique is here it's

656
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,180
example uh the technique is here it's
 

657
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,930
example uh the technique is here it's
not a matter of me getting out of the

658
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
not a matter of me getting out of the
 

659
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,230
not a matter of me getting out of the
way we're now looking at six o'clock and

660
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,240
way we're now looking at six o'clock and
 

661
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,530
way we're now looking at six o'clock and
then uh accelerating then to six o'clock

662
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:06,540
then uh accelerating then to six o'clock
 

663
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,329
then uh accelerating then to six o'clock
and they they roll

664
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339

 

665
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,929

this is not the shape of the technique

666
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
this is not the shape of the technique
 

667
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,510
this is not the shape of the technique
uh you will not have the angle of

668
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
uh you will not have the angle of
 

669
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,090
uh you will not have the angle of
cancellations that you want and you're

670
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,100
cancellations that you want and you're
 

671
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,730
cancellations that you want and you're
also not repeating the shape which is

672
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
also not repeating the shape which is
 

673
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,610
also not repeating the shape which is
necessary for deeper understandings of

674
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:25,620
necessary for deeper understandings of
 

675
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,930
necessary for deeper understandings of
the art so the art is spiral in nature

676
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:29,940
the art so the art is spiral in nature
 

677
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,669
the art so the art is spiral in nature
and something to look for then is uh one

678
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
and something to look for then is uh one
 

679
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,730
and something to look for then is uh one
an angle cancellation so let's define

680
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:37,740
an angle cancellation so let's define
 

681
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,029
an angle cancellation so let's define
that let's say she just has a fighting

682
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
that let's say she just has a fighting
 

683
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,770
that let's say she just has a fighting
stance okay

684
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:42,780
stance okay
 

685
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,870
stance okay
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal

686
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:47,880
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal
 

687
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,210
and an angle cancellation is a diagonal
line that is traversing the three planes

688
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,220
line that is traversing the three planes
 

689
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,450
line that is traversing the three planes
of height width and depth okay so for

690
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,460
of height width and depth okay so for
 

691
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,610
of height width and depth okay so for
example if I go this way straight across

692
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:55,620
example if I go this way straight across
 

693
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,190
example if I go this way straight across
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation

694
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,200
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation
 

695
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,890
it's not it's it's an angle cancellation
but not as she comes around 360 with the

696
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:00,900
but not as she comes around 360 with the
 

697
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,590
but not as she comes around 360 with the
elbow or what have you

698
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
elbow or what have you
 

699
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,310
elbow or what have you
um also straight down doesn't stop her

700
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,320
um also straight down doesn't stop her
 

701
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,789
um also straight down doesn't stop her
from punching me in the face okay

702
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:09,799
from punching me in the face okay
 

703
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,070
from punching me in the face okay
instead it's going to go diagonally in

704
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
instead it's going to go diagonally in
 

705
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,630
instead it's going to go diagonally in
and down

706
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
and down
 

707
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,750
and down
and this will create

708
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
and this will create
 

709
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,970
and this will create
um mechanical checks

710
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
um mechanical checks
 

711
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,510
um mechanical checks
just simply put here on all weapons in

712
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
just simply put here on all weapons in
 

713
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,549
just simply put here on all weapons in
the three zones of height width and

714
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:25,559
the three zones of height width and
 

715
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,230
the three zones of height width and
depth so uh she tries to kick

716
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
depth so uh she tries to kick
 

717
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,409
depth so uh she tries to kick
or she tries to punch

718
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:33,419
or she tries to punch
 

719
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,970
or she tries to punch
and that in in uh in effect will create

720
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
and that in in uh in effect will create
 

721
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,909
and that in in uh in effect will create
a field of operation we'll call it a

722
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
a field of operation we'll call it a
 

723
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,190
a field of operation we'll call it a
Zona Sanctuary okay

724
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
Zona Sanctuary okay
 

725
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,610
Zona Sanctuary okay
in the technique jujinage that's what we

726
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:46,620
in the technique jujinage that's what we
 

727
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,070
in the technique jujinage that's what we
called it uh I don't care what you call

728
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,080
called it uh I don't care what you call
 

729
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,990
called it uh I don't care what you call
it

730
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,000
it
 

731
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,049
it
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do

732
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:56,059
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do
 

733
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,789
in jujinage uh your hand is going to do
remember this hand is ultimately going

734
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
remember this hand is ultimately going
 

735
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,510
remember this hand is ultimately going
to do the out the hour spiral this way

736
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:02,520
to do the out the hour spiral this way
 

737
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,909
to do the out the hour spiral this way
so that means it has to begin first

738
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:04,919
so that means it has to begin first
 

739
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,350
so that means it has to begin first
inward

740
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:06,360
inward
 

741
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,190
inward
and you can see that you're creating a

742
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
and you can see that you're creating a
 

743
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,590
and you can see that you're creating a
place that you can be and operate from

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600

 

745
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,289

in that chest

00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:18,299
in that chest
 

747
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,070
in that chest
okay so I get my body going

748
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
okay so I get my body going
 

749
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,049
okay so I get my body going
starting the movements

750
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:24,059
starting the movements
 

751
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,730
starting the movements
oh

752
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:25,740
oh
 

753
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,029
oh
and I move into that spot

754
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
and I move into that spot
 

755
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,930
and I move into that spot
but I don't now accelerate her that way

756
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:32,940
but I don't now accelerate her that way
 

757
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,330
but I don't now accelerate her that way
this whole thing is going to come around

758
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:35,340
this whole thing is going to come around
 

759
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,490
this whole thing is going to come around
her whole body

760
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:37,500
her whole body
 

761
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,529
her whole body
and she'll go that way

762
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539

 

763
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,810

so just looking at the shape of the

get your angle cancellation move into
 

769
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,010
get your angle cancellation move into
your Zona sanctuary and then she's going

770

your Zona sanctuary and then she's going
 

771
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,400
your Zona sanctuary and then she's going
to go that way

772
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,410
to go that way
 

773
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,110

okay we'll scoot back to that
 

849
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,669
okay we'll scoot back to that
so one

850
00:21:58,669 --> 00:21:58,679
so one
 

851
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,549
so one
there's the Zona Sanctuary this is where

852
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:01,559
there's the Zona Sanctuary this is where
 

853
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,730
there's the Zona Sanctuary this is where
I do my rotation okay and not gonna

854
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:04,740
I do my rotation okay and not gonna
 

855
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,830
I do my rotation okay and not gonna
throw her that way she's gonna go around

856
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:06,840
throw her that way she's gonna go around
 

857
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,450
throw her that way she's gonna go around
me okay

858
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:08,460
me okay
 

859
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,909
me okay
so if we remember her body is coming

860
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:10,919
so if we remember her body is coming
 

861
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,430
so if we remember her body is coming
around right here

862
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
around right here
 

863
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,950
around right here
you'll see a triangle

864
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
you'll see a triangle
 

865
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,669
you'll see a triangle
this is your uh opening your tsuki for

866
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
this is your uh opening your tsuki for
 

867
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,330
this is your uh opening your tsuki for
edini you need a Yin space that you can

868
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,340
edini you need a Yin space that you can
 

869
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,890
edini you need a Yin space that you can
enter in

870
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:24,900
enter in
 

871
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,830
enter in
okay this is where I enter you over here

872
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
okay this is where I enter you over here
 

873
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,789
okay this is where I enter you over here
please okay

874
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799

 

875
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,430

uh sorry

876
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,440
uh sorry
 

877
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,710
uh sorry
what I don't want to do is accelerate

878
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
what I don't want to do is accelerate
 

879
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,490
what I don't want to do is accelerate
her elbow

880
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:40,500

 

881
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,830

if not accelerating her elbow

882
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:42,840
if not accelerating her elbow
 

883
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,570
if not accelerating her elbow
I'm going to

884
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:44,580
I'm going to
 

885
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,830
I'm going to
move into the edema space and she's

886
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,840
move into the edema space and she's
 

887
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,990
move into the edema space and she's
about to go around like use me for

888
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,000
about to go around like use me for
 

889
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,310
about to go around like use me for
balance okay

890
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
balance okay
 

891
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,830
balance okay
and she's about to go around this is all

892
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:54,840
and she's about to go around this is all
 

893
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,890
and she's about to go around this is all
light in here this is where I step and I

894
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:57,900
light in here this is where I step and I
 

895
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,549
light in here this is where I step and I
put my body here

896
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559

 

897
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,669

by doing the issue to 10 conversion

898
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:04,679
by doing the issue to 10 conversion
 

899
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,610
by doing the issue to 10 conversion
boom this is where my body goes

900
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:10,620

 

901
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,970

so the reference point is an X

902
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:16,980
so the reference point is an X
 

903
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,730
so the reference point is an X
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating

904
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:21,740
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating
 

905
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,810
she's gonna make a curve I am rotating
the shape is spiraling but in there is

906
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:26,820
the shape is spiraling but in there is
 

907
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,490
the shape is spiraling but in there is
an edema

908
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,500
an edema
 

909
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,970
an edema
and the reference point is going to be

910
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:31,980
and the reference point is going to be
 

911
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,490
and the reference point is going to be
like an X shape so as she's coming

912
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:34,500
like an X shape so as she's coming
 

913
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:42,110
like an X shape so as she's coming
around I go this way but she goes out

914
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,120

 

915
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,770

this is different from uh a parallel

916
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:45,780
this is different from uh a parallel
 

917
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,789
this is different from uh a parallel
shape

918
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
shape
 

919
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,330
shape
we're parallel to each other

920
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,340

 

921
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:03,169

whoa am I going this way

922
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,179

 

923
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,690

so think x pattern

924
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:05,700
so think x pattern
 

925
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,510
so think x pattern
when you do the x pattern

926
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,520
when you do the x pattern
 

927
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,470
when you do the x pattern
the next shape I would like you to keep

928
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:11,480
the next shape I would like you to keep
 

929
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,450
the next shape I would like you to keep
is that your back foot

930
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,460
is that your back foot
 

931
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,110
is that your back foot
does not float

932
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120

 

933
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,169

because you're rotating with her and

934
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,179
because you're rotating with her and
 

935
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,669
because you're rotating with her and
you're going to lose your throwing

936
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:22,679
you're going to lose your throwing
 

937
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,210
you're going to lose your throwing
geometry

938
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:26,220

 

939
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,850

and again that doesn't change whether

940
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:28,860
and again that doesn't change whether
 

941
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:35,270
and again that doesn't change whether
you'll hear like this

942
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,280

 

943
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,190

so my back foot is going to remain still

944
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,200
so my back foot is going to remain still
 

945
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,950
so my back foot is going to remain still
back foot remains still boom

946
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960

 

947
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,430

I'm never I'm not accelerating them so I

948
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm never I'm not accelerating them so I
 

949
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,370
I'm never I'm not accelerating them so I
don't need a little extra

950
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:55,380
don't need a little extra
 

951
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,350
don't need a little extra
um

952
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,360
um
 

953
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,789
um
inertia forward

954
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
inertia forward
 

955
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,490
inertia forward
so on this one I come this way you have

956
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:01,500
so on this one I come this way you have
 

957
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,789
so on this one I come this way you have
a lot of having to put weight on that

958
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
a lot of having to put weight on that
 

959
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,950
a lot of having to put weight on that
front foot it unweights the back foot

960
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
front foot it unweights the back foot
 

961
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,130
front foot it unweights the back foot
and it starts to float on you

962
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,140
and it starts to float on you
 

963
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,470
and it starts to float on you
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a

964
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a
 

965
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,470
I'm not doing that I'm going to make a
triangle in the middle of her Circle and

966
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:15,480
triangle in the middle of her Circle and
 

967
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,110
triangle in the middle of her Circle and
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her

968
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,120
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her
 

969
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,130
that creates a topsy-turvy effect in her
body

970
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,140
body
 

971
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,690
body
one

972
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:20,700
one
 

973
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,850
one
two

974
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:25,860

 

975
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,669

so two things on the foot shape or the

976
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:28,679
so two things on the foot shape or the
 

977
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,169
so two things on the foot shape or the
legwork

978
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:30,179
legwork
 

979
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,110
legwork
the footwork there's an x pattern to

980
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
the footwork there's an x pattern to
 

981
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,250
the footwork there's an x pattern to
your throat

982
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,260
your throat
 

983
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,549
your throat
she goes on the circle edimi goes across

984
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:37,559
she goes on the circle edimi goes across
 

985
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,630
she goes on the circle edimi goes across
the circle

986
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
the circle
 

987
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,930
the circle
and then secondly your back foot does

988
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:41,940
and then secondly your back foot does
 

989
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,990
and then secondly your back foot does
not float okay

990
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000

 

991
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:10,610

we'll do this

992
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:10,620

 

993
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,049

all right so again these are

994
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:14,059
all right so again these are
 

995
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,450
all right so again these are
intro shapes you need you want these

996
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:17,460
intro shapes you need you want these
 

997
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,450
intro shapes you need you want these
shapes you need to make problems of

998
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,460
shapes you need to make problems of
 

999
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,970
shapes you need to make problems of
these shapes keep those shapes and not

1000
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:22,980
these shapes keep those shapes and not
 

1001
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,810
these shapes keep those shapes and not
worry about what you do with them later

1002
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:26,820
worry about what you do with them later
 

1003
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,470
worry about what you do with them later
um

1004
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:27,480
um
 

1005
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,590
um
what you do with them

1006
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:30,600
what you do with them
 

1007
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,529
what you do with them
is ultimately what all those podcasts

1008
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:33,539
is ultimately what all those podcasts
 

1009
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,250
is ultimately what all those podcasts
are talking about okay these are the

1010
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,260
are talking about okay these are the
 

1011
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,450
are talking about okay these are the
shapes

1012
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:38,460
shapes
 

1013
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,930
shapes
uh that generate

1014
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:41,940
uh that generate
 

1015
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,070
uh that generate
the energy

1016
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080

 

1017
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,370

stimulations or requirements necessary

1018
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:49,380
stimulations or requirements necessary
 

1019
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,110
stimulations or requirements necessary
for accessing the god mind

1020
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120

you're going to also do things with
 

1023
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,930
you're going to also do things with
these as you progress mechanically in

these as you progress mechanically in
 

1025
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,830
these as you progress mechanically in
your kihon waza so for example uh

1026
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
your kihon waza so for example uh
 

1027
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,289
your kihon waza so for example uh
tasking yourself with the back foot

1028
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:06,299
tasking yourself with the back foot
 

1029

tasking yourself with the back foot
being grounded is going to require you

1030
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,480
being grounded is going to require you
 

1031
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,570
being grounded is going to require you
to shift your weight in a much different

1032
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
to shift your weight in a much different
 

1033
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,930
to shift your weight in a much different
way than you would if you can float your

1034
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:14,940
way than you would if you can float your
 

1035
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,549
way than you would if you can float your
back foot

1036
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
back foot
 

1037
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,430
back foot
but with your back foot grounded then

1038
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
but with your back foot grounded then
 

1039
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,950
but with your back foot grounded then
and only then can you start to gain

1040
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:21,960
and only then can you start to gain
 

1041
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,669
and only then can you start to gain
access to the internal aspects uh where

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
access to the internal aspects uh where
 

1043
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,950
access to the internal aspects uh where
you're more coke you projecting them
