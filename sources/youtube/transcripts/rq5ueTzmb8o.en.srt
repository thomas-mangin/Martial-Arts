1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,950

Hey,

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:19,960

 

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:55,229

hey, hey.

4
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,239

 

5
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:13,630

Wow. Okay.

6
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:13,640

 

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:35,510

Let's go.

8
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520

 

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,990

Don't just move your

10
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't just move your
 

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,830
Don't just move your
arm. Don't just make your arm go like

12
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
arm. Don't just make your arm go like
 

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,069
arm. Don't just make your arm go like
that. Okay? Your your pelvis

14
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,079

 

15
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,230

moves. So, this is just my arm. And you

16
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
moves. So, this is just my arm. And you
 

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,230
moves. So, this is just my arm. And you
can see how my pelvis will stay still.

18
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
can see how my pelvis will stay still.
 

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,469
can see how my pelvis will stay still.
Okay. And

20
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:55,479
Okay. And
 

21
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:08,910
Okay. And
instead I want to

22
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:08,920

 

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,190

move your pelvis moves laterally and

24
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
move your pelvis moves laterally and
 

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,150
move your pelvis moves laterally and
vertically.

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160

 

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:27,309

So it goes back

28
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:27,319

 

29
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,710

under. I'm making him push like he's

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
under. I'm making him push like he's
 

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,270
under. I'm making him push like he's
pushing me

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
pushing me
 

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,910
pushing me
here.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920

 

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,070

Okay. So I get grounded and he gets

36
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay. So I get grounded and he gets
 

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,509
Okay. So I get grounded and he gets
lifted.

38
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
lifted.
 

39
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,790
lifted.
What you're doing is you can sit above

40
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
What you're doing is you can sit above
 

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,630
What you're doing is you can sit above
the ground and you can push her.

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640

 

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,550

Okay? Or you can sink in into the

44
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:57,560
Okay? Or you can sink in into the
 

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,670
Okay? Or you can sink in into the
earth and have her push

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:00,680
earth and have her push
 

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,869
earth and have her push
herself. Guys, can you see that

48
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
herself. Guys, can you see that
 

49
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,830
herself. Guys, can you see that
difference? So, here I am. I'm pushing

50
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
difference? So, here I am. I'm pushing
 

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,270
difference? So, here I am. I'm pushing
her. or I sink down and have her push

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
her. or I sink down and have her push
 

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,190
her. or I sink down and have her push
herself like a push-up. Okay. When she's

54
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
herself like a push-up. Okay. When she's
 

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,309
herself like a push-up. Okay. When she's
here, she's pushing herself off the

56
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
here, she's pushing herself off the
 

57
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,910
here, she's pushing herself off the
earth. She goes flying.

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:20,920
earth. She goes flying.
 

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,710
earth. She goes flying.
Okay.

60
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:23,720
Okay.
 

61
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,470
Okay.
One,

62
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:25,480
One,
 

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,869
One,
two,

64
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:27,879
two,
 

65
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,509
two,
one, two. Okay. So, don't don't use your

66
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
one, two. Okay. So, don't don't use your
 

67
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,710
one, two. Okay. So, don't don't use your
arm.

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720

 

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,789

You

70
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:35,799
You
 

71
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,270
You
want him to be pushing himself over. So

72
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
want him to be pushing himself over. So
 

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:50,750
want him to be pushing himself over. So
I

74
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,760

 

75
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,430

ground. So my arm is pretty relaxed

76
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
ground. So my arm is pretty relaxed
 

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,750
ground. So my arm is pretty relaxed
here. You

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:54,760
here. You
 

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:15,990
here. You
see it's not

80
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000

 

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,069

I mean, that's pretty goofy, huh?

82
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:21,079

 

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,270

Okay, but this is

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280

 

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,670

delusion. Come on.

86
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
delusion. Come on.
 

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,230
delusion. Come on.
We're going to take this concept, the

88
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
We're going to take this concept, the
 

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,469
We're going to take this concept, the
lifting and the grounding and the

90
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
lifting and the grounding and the
 

91
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,510
lifting and the grounding and the
pelvis, okay? And of course the hand

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
pelvis, okay? And of course the hand
 

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,350
pelvis, okay? And of course the hand
work. And we're just going to change it

94
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,360
work. And we're just going to change it
 

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,189
work. And we're just going to change it
slightly. So

96
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,199
slightly. So
 

97
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,110
slightly. So
boom,

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,120

 

99
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,310

hold. And you'll get not just the

100
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
hold. And you'll get not just the
 

101
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,150
hold. And you'll get not just the
lifting you were getting,

102
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,160
lifting you were getting,
 

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:10,310
lifting you were getting,
but a small little niko variation.

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320

 

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,430

here. I stayed there because I want the

106
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
here. I stayed there because I want the
 

107
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,830
here. I stayed there because I want the
center line. I don't want to be on the

108
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
center line. I don't want to be on the
 

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,390
center line. I don't want to be on the
outside when he's got the center line.

110
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
outside when he's got the center line.
 

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,629
outside when he's got the center line.
Okay? I have the center line. Do you

112
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
Okay? I have the center line. Do you
 

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,629
Okay? I have the center line. Do you
guys see the difference? If we open up

114
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
guys see the difference? If we open up
 

115
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,390
guys see the difference? If we open up
the technique,

116
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
the technique,
 

117
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,950
the technique,
where would you rather be? So when I'm

118
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
where would you rather be? So when I'm
 

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,469
where would you rather be? So when I'm
here, she has an incentive. Hold on. Cuz

120
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
here, she has an incentive. Hold on. Cuz
 

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,510
here, she has an incentive. Hold on. Cuz
she's checking me. Do you understand? So

122
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
she's checking me. Do you understand? So
 

123
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,950
she's checking me. Do you understand? So
in her goal to stop me from hitting her

124
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
in her goal to stop me from hitting her
 

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,830
in her goal to stop me from hitting her
face, she exposes the wrist to the wrist

126
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:40,840
face, she exposes the wrist to the wrist
 

127
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,469
face, she exposes the wrist to the wrist
lock. At the same

128
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:43,479
lock. At the same
 

129
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,189
lock. At the same
time, that's where the elbow

130
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
time, that's where the elbow
 

131
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,830
time, that's where the elbow
is. You see?

132
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840

 

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,550

Okay. Now her grip is loosening from the

134
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
Okay. Now her grip is loosening from the
 

135
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,590
Okay. Now her grip is loosening from the
wrist lock. And I just step through and

136
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
wrist lock. And I just step through and
 

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,590
wrist lock. And I just step through and
I'll push through the grip right to the

138
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,600

 

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,430

elbow. Don't reverse your

140
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,440

 

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,870

motion. That's a lot to ask for in a

142
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
motion. That's a lot to ask for in a
 

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,469
motion. That's a lot to ask for in a
fight. Oh, I come back here for no

144
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
fight. Oh, I come back here for no
 

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,230
fight. Oh, I come back here for no
reason and then I'm going to grab her.

146
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
reason and then I'm going to grab her.
 

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,590
reason and then I'm going to grab her.
It's going to be there when I get there.

148
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
It's going to be there when I get there.
 

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,790
It's going to be there when I get there.
It's not going to be there when you get

150
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
It's not going to be there when you get
 

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,550
It's not going to be there when you get
there.

152
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560

 

153
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,710

Use the wrist lock to get out of the

154
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
Use the wrist lock to get out of the
 

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,870
Use the wrist lock to get out of the
grip. Don't peel the hand off and then

156
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
grip. Don't peel the hand off and then
 

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,870
grip. Don't peel the hand off and then
come in. That too is a joke.

158
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:37,880

 

159
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:54,150

Oh, baby.

160
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160

 

161
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,710

So, when you train, you have previous

162
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
So, when you train, you have previous
 

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,790
So, when you train, you have previous
knowledge, right? You have in your head,

164
00:06:59,790 --> 00:06:59,800
knowledge, right? You have in your head,
 

165
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,070
knowledge, right? You have in your head,
EQ, okay? And it's getting in the way of

166
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
EQ, okay? And it's getting in the way of
 

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,150
EQ, okay? And it's getting in the way of
what you might be seeing.

168
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
what you might be seeing.
 

169
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,749
what you might be seeing.
Okay, first of all, you should know the

170
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
Okay, first of all, you should know the
 

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,990
Okay, first of all, you should know the
name Eeko. It it's it's everybody has a
