00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719

 

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,990

so the idea here is that he goes that

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
so the idea here is that he goes that
 

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,109
so the idea here is that he goes that
you're you don't want to

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
you're you don't want to
 

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,870
you're you don't want to
play your escapes from side control

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
play your escapes from side control
 

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,550
play your escapes from side control
okay so you're thinking ahead he opened

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
okay so you're thinking ahead he opened
 

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,630
okay so you're thinking ahead he opened
the guard he's coming around there's

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
the guard he's coming around there's
 

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,150
the guard he's coming around there's
that five step you see and you've moved

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
that five step you see and you've moved
 

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,830
that five step you see and you've moved
inside his Circle so not after the fact

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:34,840
inside his Circle so not after the fact
 

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,950
inside his Circle so not after the fact
not here and then you're try to

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:37,960
not here and then you're try to
 

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,029
not here and then you're try to
do he's making a circle you move inside

20
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:42,039
do he's making a circle you move inside
 

21
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,630
do he's making a circle you move inside
his

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:43,640
his
 

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,670
his
Circle and you're up you see then move

24
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
Circle and you're up you see then move
 

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,310
Circle and you're up you see then move
out of the

26
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,320
out of the
 

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,830
out of the
way and you

28
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:52,840

 

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,069

have coming around right move inside the

30
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,079
have coming around right move inside the
 

31
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,910
have coming around right move inside the
circles it's the same thing here

32
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920

 

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,710

so he got through cool and your movement

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
so he got through cool and your movement
 

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,990
so he got through cool and your movement
and you have so I'm coming

36
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
and you have so I'm coming
 

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,230
and you have so I'm coming
around here and the same thing I now

38
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,240
around here and the same thing I now
 

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,789
around here and the same thing I now
don't want to push into that that's

40
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
don't want to push into that that's
 

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,789
don't want to push into that that's
what's giv them so again I ride this

42
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:17,799
what's giv them so again I ride this
 

43
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,590
what's giv them so again I ride this
over okay and then you're now chest to

44
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:20,600
over okay and then you're now chest to
 

45
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,109
over okay and then you're now chest to
chest and then you can

46
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,119
chest and then you can
 

47
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,109
chest and then you can
reacquire side control so I don't fight

48
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
reacquire side control so I don't fight
 

49
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,510
reacquire side control so I don't fight
it so I'm not trying to smash it I'm

50
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
it so I'm not trying to smash it I'm
 

51
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,990
it so I'm not trying to smash it I'm
staying at the edge kind of like EO okay

52
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
staying at the edge kind of like EO okay
 

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,630
staying at the edge kind of like EO okay
okay so you coming around you feel it

54
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
okay so you coming around you feel it
 

55
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,310
okay so you coming around you feel it
move out of your way coming

56
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
move out of your way coming
 

57
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,789
move out of your way coming
around inside that Circle so he's

58
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
around inside that Circle so he's
 

59
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,350
around inside that Circle so he's
starting to pass I'm looking for the

60
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
starting to pass I'm looking for the
 

61
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,749
starting to pass I'm looking for the
bicep control I feel him go there I go

62
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:44,759
bicep control I feel him go there I go
 

63
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,990
bicep control I feel him go there I go
around this way onto the tricep

64
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
around this way onto the tricep
 

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,550
around this way onto the tricep
okay

66
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560

 

67
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,149

again it's going that way go to the

68
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:55,159
again it's going that way go to the
 

69
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,469
again it's going that way go to the
tricep okay sit up this way

70
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:03,479

 

71
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:13,430

let's move this way

72
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440

 

73
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,430

okay again a lot of it depends on what

74
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
okay again a lot of it depends on what
 

75
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,670
okay again a lot of it depends on what
he's doing

76
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:18,680
he's doing
 

77
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,990
he's doing
so uh don't make techniques out of it so

78
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
so uh don't make techniques out of it so
 

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,229
so uh don't make techniques out of it so
as I come here and I'm coming up you see

80
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
as I come here and I'm coming up you see
 

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,390
as I come here and I'm coming up you see
and you're like w there's too much space

82
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
and you're like w there's too much space
 

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,949
and you're like w there's too much space
here you see so I get

84
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959

 

85
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,550

out it's coming around and try countered

86
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,560
out it's coming around and try countered
 

87
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,309
out it's coming around and try countered
you go to here you see oh there's just

88
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
you go to here you see oh there's just
 

89
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,750
you go to here you see oh there's just
too much weight so I kind of sit up you

90
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
too much weight so I kind of sit up you
 

91
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,990
too much weight so I kind of sit up you
see I kind of sit up and I start moving

92
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,000
see I kind of sit up and I start moving
 

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
see I kind of sit up and I start moving
myself

94
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,760
myself
 

95
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,589
myself
out do one more and and we won't take it

96
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:56,599
out do one more and and we won't take it
 

97
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,869
out do one more and and we won't take it
into a reversal so I'm going this way

98
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:01,879
into a reversal so I'm going this way
 

99
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,430
into a reversal so I'm going this way
this way now keep going okay he's trying

100
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
this way now keep going okay he's trying
 

101
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,350
this way now keep going okay he's trying
to get on so you're going to

102
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,360
to get on so you're going to
 

103
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,229
to get on so you're going to
roll this way he keeps going and you

104
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
roll this way he keeps going and you
 

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,869
roll this way he keeps going and you
keep that okay and then when you come in

106
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:15,879
keep that okay and then when you come in
 

107
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,589
keep that okay and then when you come in
and you can get BL fly so the principle

108
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:18,599
and you can get BL fly so the principle
 

109
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,670
and you can get BL fly so the principle
those is the same on the

110
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
those is the same on the
 

111
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,110
those is the same on the
circle it's not down here and trying

112
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,120
circle it's not down here and trying
 

113
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,509
circle it's not down here and trying
it

114
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
it
 

115
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,429
it
reverse it's as he's moving you're going

116
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:32,439
reverse it's as he's moving you're going
 

117
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,229
reverse it's as he's moving you're going
this way

118
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:35,239
this way
 

119
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,630
this way
okay and you start

120
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:37,640
okay and you start
 

121
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,030
okay and you start
working this door he's

122
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
working this door he's
 

123
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,229
working this door he's
going and I go this

124
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239

 

125
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,910

way okay if he's going to give me chest

126
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
way okay if he's going to give me chest
 

127
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,550
way okay if he's going to give me chest
to chest then I'll then I'm going to

128
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,560
to chest then I'll then I'm going to
 

129
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,910
to chest then I'll then I'm going to
stay down but if he's if there's space

130
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
stay down but if he's if there's space
 

131
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,869
stay down but if he's if there's space
or whatever then I'm I'm going to try to

132
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
or whatever then I'm I'm going to try to
 

133
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,229
or whatever then I'm I'm going to try to
escape and get more Mobility going okay

134
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
escape and get more Mobility going okay
 

135
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,309
escape and get more Mobility going okay
so um

136
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
so um
 

137
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,910
so um
let's say he's down and on on this one

138
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
let's say he's down and on on this one
 

139
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,069
let's say he's down and on on this one
okay I'm coming around and he starts to

140
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,079
okay I'm coming around and he starts to
 

141
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,069
okay I'm coming around and he starts to
turn that way inside the circle okay now

142
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:11,079
turn that way inside the circle okay now
 

143
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,949
turn that way inside the circle okay now
if he gets enough and I'm here like that

144
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
if he gets enough and I'm here like that
 

145
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,509
if he gets enough and I'm here like that
he's going to get chest to chest you see

146
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
he's going to get chest to chest you see
 

147
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,789
he's going to get chest to chest you see
oh there we go okay you do the same

148
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
oh there we go okay you do the same
 

149
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,670
oh there we go okay you do the same
thing right but if I'm coming around and

150
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
thing right but if I'm coming around and
 

151
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,749
thing right but if I'm coming around and
he's here and I'm here like that he's

152
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:26,759
he's here and I'm here like that he's
 

153
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,110
he's here and I'm here like that he's
not going to he's not going to get it a

154
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
not going to he's not going to get it a
 

155
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,350
not going to he's not going to get it a
second before before I clear this okay

156
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
second before before I clear this okay
 

157
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,029
second before before I clear this okay
so he sits up and he goes out and then

158
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:34,039
so he sits up and he goes out and then
 

159
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,070
so he sits up and he goes out and then
he's working butterfly guard you see so

160
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
he's working butterfly guard you see so
 

161
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,990
he's working butterfly guard you see so
I come to clothes on him and he's

162
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,000
I come to clothes on him and he's
 

163
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,670
I come to clothes on him and he's
