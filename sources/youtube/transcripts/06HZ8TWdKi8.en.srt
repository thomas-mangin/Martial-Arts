00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,069
because the
force just fills the Y do you do you get

28
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:45,079
force just fills the Y do you do you get
 

29
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,830

00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:57,800
chin I can't C is a iif to shove it
 

33
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,509
chin I can't C is a iif to shove it
okay what I what I need is the the

00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:02,519
okay what I what I need is the the
 

35
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,390
okay what I what I need is the the
variability that you can't drive do you

36
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
variability that you can't drive do you
 

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,230
variability that you can't drive do you
see you can't drive you can't push me

38
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
see you can't drive you can't push me
 

39
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,190
see you can't drive you can't push me
that allows me

40
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200

 

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,270

to make it go slow no matter how hard

42
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
to make it go slow no matter how hard
 

43
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,630
to make it go slow no matter how hard
you're pushing such that someone doesn't

44
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
you're pushing such that someone doesn't
 

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,630
you're pushing such that someone doesn't
even think you're pushing you see that

46
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
even think you're pushing you see that
 

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,590
even think you're pushing you see that
um that skill is the same one Whatever

48
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:28,600
um that skill is the same one Whatever
 

49
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,590
um that skill is the same one Whatever
where I I um contact you get it okay and

50
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
where I I um contact you get it okay and
 

51
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,310
where I I um contact you get it okay and
that skill is different from a

52
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
that skill is different from a
 

53
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,550
that skill is different from a
catch okay so that's what we're trying

54
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
catch okay so that's what we're trying
 

55
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,990
catch okay so that's what we're trying
to do so when when you touch

56
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,000

 

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,429

touch it's it doesn't have to be

58
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439

 

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,030

around it doesn't have to be straight

60
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
around it doesn't have to be straight
 

61
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,950
around it doesn't have to be straight
and keep you out here either because you

62
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
and keep you out here either because you
 

63
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,270
and keep you out here either because you
can't pull

64
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,280
can't pull
 

65
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,230
can't pull
you see it it can't come back to me in

66
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
you see it it can't come back to me in
 

67
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,910
you see it it can't come back to me in
other words so a catch comes back to me

68
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920
other words so a catch comes back to me
 

69
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,310
other words so a catch comes back to me

71
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,750
but it's external till till it hits the
ground p and the seizure

72
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:10,760
ground p and the seizure
 

73
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,910
ground p and the seizure
is is on right at touch so what is on

74
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:14,920
is is on right at touch so what is on
