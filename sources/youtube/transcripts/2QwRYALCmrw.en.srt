okay so

00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,550
okay so
uh in that video there's four points of

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
uh in that video there's four points of
 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,750
uh in that video there's four points of
Yong Yong clashing so I'll introduce

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
Yong Yong clashing so I'll introduce
 

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,830
Yong Yong clashing so I'll introduce
those four points and then show how we

8
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:12,840
those four points and then show how we
 

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,510
those four points and then show how we
don't do that again when we comes to non

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
don't do that again when we comes to non
 

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,910
don't do that again when we comes to non
contestation uh you have to do that 90°

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,920
contestation uh you have to do that 90°
 

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,429

00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:24,439
fluctuation to the inertia and that
 

15
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,109

means that you're going to have to do a

means that you're going to have to do a

19
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,069

you will be at a constant 90°

then you don't have to push his elbow

122
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
then you don't have to push his elbow

then you don't have to push his elbow
which is the second

which is the second
 

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,590

let's say uh he wants to stand up okay

166
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
let's say uh he wants to stand up okay
 

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,950

so he's here and when he goes to stand
 

169
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,350
so he's here and when he goes to stand
up it makes him go off balance

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:08,830
him and I'm here in the
adhesion okay and that's where I do the

180
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:08,840

 

181
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,710

transition around me into the body

182
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
transition around me into the body
 

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:24,230
transition around me into the body
adhesion and that keeps the transition

184
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240

 

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,390

viable okay we'll do that transition the

186
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
viable okay we'll do that transition the
 

187
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,790
viable okay we'll do that transition the
next condensation point

188
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800

 

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,270

is in the pain compliance s here okay so

190
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,280
is in the pain compliance s here okay so
 

191
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,029
is in the pain compliance s here okay so
instead of doing

192
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,039
instead of doing
 

193
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,270
instead of doing
that get the Shoulder to move with the

194
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
that get the Shoulder to move with the
 

195
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,029
that get the Shoulder to move with the
projection so this I'm in the body and I

196
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
projection so this I'm in the body and I
 

197
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,869
projection so this I'm in the body and I
move in the body into that

198
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
move in the body into that
 

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,510
move in the body into that
shoulder okay and so I'm moving his

200
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
shoulder okay and so I'm moving his
 

201
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,790
shoulder okay and so I'm moving his
body not Twi tting and he moves his body

202
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:01,800
body not Twi tting and he moves his body
 

203
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,830
body not Twi tting and he moves his body
to take that pain

204
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
to take that pain
 

205
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,270
to take that pain
off I'm moving his body this is

206
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
off I'm moving his body this is
 

207
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,950
off I'm moving his body this is
effortless so we're

208
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:13,960

 

209
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,430

here and he's going to twist to hurt me

210
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
here and he's going to twist to hurt me
 

211
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,309
here and he's going to twist to hurt me
and you'll see this L time in here okay

212
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
and you'll see this L time in here okay
 

213
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,629
and you'll see this L time in here okay
that's telling you it's didn't travel up

214
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
that's telling you it's didn't travel up
 

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,190
that's telling you it's didn't travel up
the joints and then the UK goes back he

216
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
the joints and then the UK goes back he
 

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,469
the joints and then the UK goes back he
okay so he's there and this is dependent

218
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
okay so he's there and this is dependent
 

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,230
okay so he's there and this is dependent
upon his ability to keep that Integrity

220
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
upon his ability to keep that Integrity
 

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,389
upon his ability to keep that Integrity
you see you okay so it's a strength move

222
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
you see you okay so it's a strength move

immediately I start
 

283
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,030
immediately I start
working that angle and I throw the

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
working that angle and I throw the
 

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,670
working that angle and I throw the

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,040
okay but if she tries to twist the other
 

291
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,710

way oh it's going to go right into that

292
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
way oh it's going to go right into that
 

293
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,670
way oh it's going to go right into that
wrist but it's very impossible to get

294
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
wrist but it's very impossible to get
 

295
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,230

your Center back you're going to have to

296
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,240
your Center back you're going to have to
 

297
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,750
your Center back you're going to have to
shift levels and that's where we're

298
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:02,760
shift levels and that's where we're
 

299
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,069
shift levels and that's where we're
going from here okay try to all right

300
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:05,079
going from here okay try to all right
 

301
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,509
going from here okay try to all right
the next contention point is on the

302
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,519
the next contention point is on the
 

303
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,790
the next contention point is on the
final

304
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,800
final
 

305
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,629
final
pin and they go here and you're pushing

306
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:16,639
pin and they go here and you're pushing
 

307
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,350
pin and they go here and you're pushing
down on that so you're like I'm going to

308
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,360
down on that so you're like I'm going to
 

309
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,269
down on that so you're like I'm going to
take him over here no you're freaking

310
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:22,279
take him over here no you're freaking
 

311
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,230
take him over here no you're freaking
not okay you're not okay so we have to

312
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
not okay you're not okay so we have to
 

313
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,750
not okay you're not okay so we have to
not adopt that linear

314
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
not adopt that linear
 

315
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,550
not adopt that linear
contestation

316
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:33,560

 

317
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,230

angle and instead continue to use the

318
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
angle and instead continue to use the
 

319
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,949
angle and instead continue to use the
spiral so he's going to go

320
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
spiral so he's going to go
 

321
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,509
spiral so he's going to go
down and this hand's not pushing down

322
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
down and this hand's not pushing down
 

323
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,509
down and this hand's not pushing down
but keeping the spiral going and he will

324
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
but keeping the spiral going and he will
 

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:12:20,189
but keeping the spiral going and he will
eventually see where he could fall

326
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:20,199

 

327
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,069

which makes my elbow control exactly

328
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
which makes my elbow control exactly
 

329
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,670
which makes my elbow control exactly
that elbow

330
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680

 

331
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,509

control not push

332
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:30,519
control not push
 

333
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,310
control not push
down okay it's not shoving

334
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
down okay it's not shoving
 

335
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:52,020
down okay it's not shoving
down then you have the pig all right TR

336
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,030
