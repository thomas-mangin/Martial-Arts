so it did what it needed to do
 

337
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,790
so it did what it needed to do
[Music]

338
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
[Music]
 

339
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,309
[Music]
and only what it needed to do

340
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
and only what it needed to do
 

341
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,909
and only what it needed to do
that's why i don't drop my house boom

342
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
that's why i don't drop my house boom
 

343
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,589
that's why i don't drop my house boom
boom i'm over here because i'm looking

344
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
boom i'm over here because i'm looking
 

345
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:06,629
boom i'm over here because i'm looking
for that because i saw that

346
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639

 

347
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,950

so we're gonna go we'll do two little

348
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
so we're gonna go we'll do two little
 

349
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,629
so we're gonna go we'll do two little
variations

350
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
variations
 

351
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,029
variations
so this one's going to go here

352
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
so this one's going to go here
 

353
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,950
so this one's going to go here
boom to hit which is more reason why i

354
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
boom to hit which is more reason why i
 

355
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,790
boom to hit which is more reason why i
bought my hands

356
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
bought my hands
 

357
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,550
bought my hands
up so i hit as he's striking again

358
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
up so i hit as he's striking again
 

359
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,510
up so i hit as he's striking again
okay so i'm going to hit as he's

360
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
okay so i'm going to hit as he's
 

361
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,390
okay so i'm going to hit as he's
striking

362
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
striking
 

363
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,230
striking
i'm going to grab the head and you're

364
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
i'm going to grab the head and you're
 

365
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,389
i'm going to grab the head and you're
going to have the front

366
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
going to have the front
 

367
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:40,949
going to have the front
inward kazushi pattern right here

368
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
inward kazushi pattern right here
 

369
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,389
inward kazushi pattern right here
so boom boom in you know

370
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
so boom boom in you know
 

371
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,550
so boom boom in you know
that same knee kick i'm just going to

372
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
that same knee kick i'm just going to
 

373
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,509
that same knee kick i'm just going to
pick this leg

374
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
pick this leg
 

375
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,870
pick this leg
up and around

376
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880

 

377
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,710

then i have the technique one

378
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
then i have the technique one
 

379
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,310
then i have the technique one
boom in and right

380
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320

 

381
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,949

okay let's

382
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959

 

383
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,990

he moves in i hit okay

384
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
he moves in i hit okay
 

385
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,949
he moves in i hit okay
and now i'm i'm on this back corner okay

386
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
and now i'm i'm on this back corner okay
 

387
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,350
and now i'm i'm on this back corner okay
so

388
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
so
 

389
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,710
so
what i'm going to do is seek uh more

390
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
what i'm going to do is seek uh more
 

391
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,990
what i'm going to do is seek uh more
more back corner okay so what's he want

392
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
more back corner okay so what's he want
 

393
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,030
more back corner okay so what's he want
to do

394
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
to do
 

395
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,070
to do
he wants to follow me you see so

396
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
he wants to follow me you see so
 

397
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,550
he wants to follow me you see so
i see more about corner he follows me

398
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
i see more about corner he follows me
 

399
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,150
i see more about corner he follows me
and then

400
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
and then
 

401
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,269
and then
i have pura the first one i had a motive

402
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
i have pura the first one i had a motive
 

403
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,750
i have pura the first one i had a motive
and now i have buddha because my final

404
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
and now i have buddha because my final
 

405
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,269
and now i have buddha because my final
geometry

406
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
geometry
 

407
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,790
geometry
boom changed and went to the spiral

408
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
boom changed and went to the spiral
 

409
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,509
boom changed and went to the spiral
you see and so it goes to the spiral i

410
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
you see and so it goes to the spiral i
 

411
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,550
you see and so it goes to the spiral i
pull the head down

412
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
pull the head down
 

413
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,670
pull the head down
find the leg

414
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680

 

415
00:09:47,680 --> 00:10:17,430

boom i start to move he moves

416
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440

 

417
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,670

decisions i'm looking for the spiral

418
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
decisions i'm looking for the spiral
 

419
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,389
decisions i'm looking for the spiral
geometry that's in all my kinhon laws

420
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
geometry that's in all my kinhon laws
 

421
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,110
geometry that's in all my kinhon laws
okay

422
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
okay
 

423
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,389
okay
so here here and

424
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
so here here and
 

425
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,350
so here here and
boom what i'm doing here is trying to

426
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
boom what i'm doing here is trying to
 

427
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,310
boom what i'm doing here is trying to
get back here

428
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320

 

429
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,470

so it looks something like this if he

430
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
so it looks something like this if he
 

431
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,990
so it looks something like this if he
stays still

432
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000

 

433
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,310

but in the same way that i'm looking for

434
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
but in the same way that i'm looking for
 

435
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,030
but in the same way that i'm looking for
the right

436
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
the right
 

437
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,990
the right
once the left comes the same way when i

438
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
once the left comes the same way when i
 

439
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,310
once the left comes the same way when i
go

440
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
go
 

441
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,350
go
here i'm looking for this turn

442
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
here i'm looking for this turn
 

443
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,550
here i'm looking for this turn
yes i'm aware of the back hand but after

444
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
yes i'm aware of the back hand but after
 

445
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,670
yes i'm aware of the back hand but after
he throws this

446
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
he throws this
 

447
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,230
he throws this
hand and he pulls it back because that's

448
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
hand and he pulls it back because that's
 

449
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,670
hand and he pulls it back because that's
what he's trying to do

450
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
what he's trying to do
 

451
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,310
what he's trying to do
it's very awkward to do that i'm aware

452
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
it's very awkward to do that i'm aware
 

453
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,430
it's very awkward to do that i'm aware
of it though

454
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
of it though
 

455
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,389
of it though
so when i get here i can play the setup

456
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
so when i get here i can play the setup
 

457
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,509
so when i get here i can play the setup
he's going to want to turn

458
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
he's going to want to turn
 

459
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,630
he's going to want to turn
into me and when he turns into me

460
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
into me and when he turns into me
 

461
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,720
into me and when he turns into me
that's where i have

462
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:16,730

 

463
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,990

[Music]

464
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000

 

465
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,790

the only difference is i'm head and leg

466
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800

 

467
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,150

okay let's go so to train in terms of

468
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
okay let's go so to train in terms of
 

469
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,790
okay let's go so to train in terms of
principle

470
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
principle
 

471
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,630
principle
is to actually apply things that are

472
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
is to actually apply things that are
 

473
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,710
is to actually apply things that are
consistent with what you're seeing in

474
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
consistent with what you're seeing in
 

475
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,829
consistent with what you're seeing in
your kihon was it

476
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
your kihon was it
 

477
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,870
your kihon was it
it's not to plug and play

478
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
it's not to plug and play
 

479
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,829
it's not to plug and play
that is that is a very beginner level

480
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
that is that is a very beginner level
 

481
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,030
that is that is a very beginner level
understanding

482
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
understanding
 

483
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,350
understanding
but so too then i don't um

484
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
but so too then i don't um
 

485
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,590
but so too then i don't um
necessarily then do things exactly the

486
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
necessarily then do things exactly the
 

487
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,389
necessarily then do things exactly the
same way

488
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
same way
 

489
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,030
same way
okay so for example this is what you'll

490
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
okay so for example this is what you'll
 

491
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,350
okay so for example this is what you'll
tend to do so i go one

492
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
tend to do so i go one
 

493
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,870
tend to do so i go one
and two and then i'm gonna go here

494
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
and two and then i'm gonna go here
 

495
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,910
and two and then i'm gonna go here
you see and i'm gonna try to pull his

496
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
you see and i'm gonna try to pull his
 

497
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,790
you see and i'm gonna try to pull his
head down

498
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
head down
 

499
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,710
head down
here but this is a perfectly balanced

500
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
here but this is a perfectly balanced
 

501
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,310
here but this is a perfectly balanced
person and that is not consistent with

502
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
person and that is not consistent with
 

503
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,470
person and that is not consistent with
my kihon waza principles

504
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
my kihon waza principles
 

505
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,470
my kihon waza principles
so i to go like this just pretend please

i pull his head down and i come around
thought

510
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
thought
 

511
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,590
thought
you're going to be in for the same

512

you're going to be in for the same
wake-up call

514
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
wake-up call
 

515
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,230
wake-up call
that that aikidoka gets whenever they go

516
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
that that aikidoka gets whenever they go
 

517
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,470
that that aikidoka gets whenever they go
with the non-choreographed phuket

518
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
with the non-choreographed phuket
 

519
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,550
with the non-choreographed phuket
well i'm just standing here you didn't

520
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
well i'm just standing here you didn't
 

521
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,910
well i'm just standing here you didn't
do anything okay

522
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
do anything okay
 

523
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,030
do anything okay
so when you do for example uh

524
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
so when you do for example uh
 

525
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,990
so when you do for example uh
nagi you see you lower his head your

526
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
nagi you see you lower his head your
 

527
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,110
nagi you see you lower his head your
lowest head

528
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
lowest head
 

529
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,310
lowest head
makes the back half life he's off

530
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
makes the back half life he's off
 

531
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,710
makes the back half life he's off
balance

532
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
balance
 

533
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,310
balance
by things i do prior to the throw

534
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
by things i do prior to the throw
 

535
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,030
by things i do prior to the throw
so the same thing goes here so when i'm

536
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
so the same thing goes here so when i'm
 

537
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,470
so the same thing goes here so when i'm
going one

538
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
going one
 

539
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,829
going one
two and i'm moving this way that

540
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
two and i'm moving this way that
 

541
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,470
two and i'm moving this way that
is what i'm looking for that's the

542
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
is what i'm looking for that's the
 

543
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,110
is what i'm looking for that's the
energy i use

544
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
energy i use
 

545
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,990
energy i use
and that's consistent with kihon masa

546
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
and that's consistent with kihon masa
 

547
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,470
and that's consistent with kihon masa
not

548
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
not
 

549
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,509
not
doing kijoon masa strangely here

550
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
doing kijoon masa strangely here
 

551
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,269
doing kijoon masa strangely here
that's not consistent because he's

552
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
that's not consistent because he's
 

553
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,790
that's not consistent because he's
perfectly balanced

554
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
perfectly balanced
 

555
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,990
perfectly balanced
so when i do the maneuver boom i'm

556
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
so when i do the maneuver boom i'm
 

557
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,509
so when i do the maneuver boom i'm
moving here my guard is up

558
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
moving here my guard is up
 

559
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,870
moving here my guard is up
i'm not going for his neck yet

560
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
i'm not going for his neck yet
 

561
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,910
i'm not going for his neck yet
i'm moving here

562
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920

 

563
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,910

because that's where my hands need to be

564
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
because that's where my hands need to be
 

565
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,990
because that's where my hands need to be
to do the work that is needed

566
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
to do the work that is needed
 

567
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,230
to do the work that is needed
so one two i move that's what i want

568
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
so one two i move that's what i want
 

569
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,150
so one two i move that's what i want
so when he does that then i have the

570
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
so when he does that then i have the
 

571
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,389
so when he does that then i have the
energy that i harmonize with and it's

572
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
energy that i harmonize with and it's
 

573
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,990
energy that i harmonize with and it's
then that i'm consistent with my

574
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
then that i'm consistent with my
 

575
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,800
then that i'm consistent with my
team and laza okay try it again
