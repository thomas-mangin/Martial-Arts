667
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,490
weapons
or I'll watch them do certain techniques

668
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,500
or I'll watch them do certain techniques
 

669
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,970
or I'll watch them do certain techniques
and they really don't like them

670
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
and they really don't like them
 

671
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,790
and they really don't like them
and it's a little bit like I'm watching

672
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
and it's a little bit like I'm watching
 

673
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,710

677
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,750

and then

678
