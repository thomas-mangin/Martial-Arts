1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,290

notice that the uh

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,300
notice that the uh
 

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,909
notice that the uh
weapon has this curve you see

4
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919

 

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,750

that's that's an energy line so as I

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:11,760
that's that's an energy line so as I
 

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,209
that's that's an energy line so as I
come around I want to lose contact I'm

8
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:14,219
come around I want to lose contact I'm
 

9
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,450
come around I want to lose contact I'm
going to keep contact come around and I

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,460
going to keep contact come around and I
 

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,189
going to keep contact come around and I
will be able

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
will be able
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,550
will be able
when I hit the the convex Apex of that

14
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
when I hit the the convex Apex of that
 

15
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,090
when I hit the the convex Apex of that
curve that's where I'm going to put my

16
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,100
curve that's where I'm going to put my
 

17
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,910
curve that's where I'm going to put my
Apex of my curve and that'll do the

18
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:28,920
Apex of my curve and that'll do the
 

19
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,910
Apex of my curve and that'll do the
displacing for me

20
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920

 

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,750

okay so around

22
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:34,760
okay so around
 

23
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,030
okay so around
and I can be pretty straight but his

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
and I can be pretty straight but his
 

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,290
and I can be pretty straight but his
Vulcan is being displaced

26
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,300

 

27
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,810

you do it all early you see it's in the

28
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
you do it all early you see it's in the
 

29
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,670
you do it all early you see it's in the
way and I gotta move it and I gotta take

30
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
way and I gotta move it and I gotta take
 

31
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,069
way and I gotta move it and I gotta take
this angle over here so I would like for

32
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
this angle over here so I would like for
 

33
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,729
this angle over here so I would like for
you to feel just the the energy of his

34
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:52,739
you to feel just the the energy of his
 

35
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,850
you to feel just the the energy of his
of the curvature you you'll feel the yin

36
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860
of the curvature you you'll feel the yin
 

37
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,650
of the curvature you you'll feel the yin
and that's where you feel that you

38
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:57,660
and that's where you feel that you
 

39
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,570
and that's where you feel that you
change to yawn so you'll feel it

40
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:04,580

 

41
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,190

it'll displace on its own without you

42
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
it'll displace on its own without you
 

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,990
it'll displace on its own without you
having to do anything drastic with your

44
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
having to do anything drastic with your
 

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,109
having to do anything drastic with your
hands okay try to

46
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
hands okay try to
 

47
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,630
hands okay try to
all right so he's gonna he's gonna go

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
all right so he's gonna he's gonna go
 

49
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,690
all right so he's gonna he's gonna go
around that and I'm gonna feel when whoa

50
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
around that and I'm gonna feel when whoa
 

51
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,550
around that and I'm gonna feel when whoa
right when I feel that displacement

52
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
right when I feel that displacement
 

53
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,350
right when I feel that displacement
thing

54
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
thing
 

55
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,710
thing
you're gonna feel the the energy of the

56
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
you're gonna feel the the energy of the
 

57
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,690
you're gonna feel the the energy of the
two weapons are gonna change and I'm

58
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
two weapons are gonna change and I'm
 

59
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,270
two weapons are gonna change and I'm
Gonna Keep it and now I have to hang it

60
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,280

 

61
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,429

whoa right when I feel this boom and you

62
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
whoa right when I feel this boom and you
 

63
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,310
whoa right when I feel this boom and you
see I have that

64
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,589
okay
the one thing you can pay attention to

72
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:24,599
the one thing you can pay attention to
 

73
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,070
the one thing you can pay attention to
is he's coming in that shouldn't happen

74
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
is he's coming in that shouldn't happen
 

75
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,589
is he's coming in that shouldn't happen
we're now mismatched okay that there's

76
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:30,599
we're now mismatched okay that there's
 

77
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,770
we're now mismatched okay that there's
no there's no energy for me to get back

78
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:33,780
no there's no energy for me to get back
 

79
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,470
no there's no energy for me to get back
on the young side of this so he's gonna

80
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
on the young side of this so he's gonna
 

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,449
on the young side of this so he's gonna
do Yang here he's going to displace me

82
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:38,459
do Yang here he's going to displace me
 

83
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,369
do Yang here he's going to displace me
it's gonna take a lot of muscle for me

84
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
it's gonna take a lot of muscle for me
 

85
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,729
it's gonna take a lot of muscle for me
to do that so as a metric you can use

86
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:43,739
to do that so as a metric you can use
 

87
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,250
to do that so as a metric you can use
the fact that he's coming around going

88
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,260
the fact that he's coming around going
 

89
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,089
the fact that he's coming around going
sorry

90
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:47,099
sorry
 

91
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,089
sorry
he's coming around that our sword stayed

92
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:50,099
he's coming around that our sword stayed
 

93
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,630
he's coming around that our sword stayed
even this thing for most of it until I

94
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
even this thing for most of it until I
 

95
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,869
even this thing for most of it until I
decide to let him go by oh and that's

96
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
decide to let him go by oh and that's
 

97
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,410
decide to let him go by oh and that's
when I'm coming in okay

98
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,420

 

99
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,790

close the gap too early

100
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800

 

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,270

so I'm coming around this time so I'm

102
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,280
so I'm coming around this time so I'm
 

103
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,670
so I'm coming around this time so I'm
coming around boom there he goes he's

104
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:10,680
coming around boom there he goes he's
 

105
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,350
coming around boom there he goes he's
coming back in I'm gonna be clear

106
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360

 

107
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,170

okay notice that I'm still stuck on him

108
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
okay notice that I'm still stuck on him
 

109
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,050
okay notice that I'm still stuck on him
and what I'm doing is rotating the cross

110
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,060
and what I'm doing is rotating the cross
 

111
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,570
and what I'm doing is rotating the cross
around this way

112
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,580
around this way
 

113
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,610
around this way
here

114
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:28,620
here
 

115
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,710
here
we don't lose contact

116
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
we don't lose contact
 

117
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,449
we don't lose contact
so around four around two

118
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:35,459
so around four around two
 

119
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:47,950
so around four around two

adhesion right so I'm going to get that
 

147
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,749
adhesion right so I'm going to get that
pressure there and then I'm going to be

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,790

all that kind of stuff that I'm doing I
have to first before I can do that I

154
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:01,139
have to first before I can do that I
 

155
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,830
have to first before I can do that I
have to be sensitive to what is his

have to be sensitive to what is his
 

157
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,350
have to be sensitive to what is his
energy level so that I can get this

do you see and then as he relaxes and
 

163
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,550
do you see and then as he relaxes and
tries to counter it becomes even harder

164
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
tries to counter it becomes even harder
 

165
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,070
tries to counter it becomes even harder
it becomes even harder to feel that so I

166
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
it becomes even harder to feel that so I
 

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,070
it becomes even harder to feel that so I
have to increase my sensitivity okay so

168
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
have to increase my sensitivity okay so
 

169
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,650
have to increase my sensitivity okay so
