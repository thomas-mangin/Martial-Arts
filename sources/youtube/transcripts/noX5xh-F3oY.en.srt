see what that is but
 

81
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,630
see what that is but
that's the basic philosophy that i

82
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
that's the basic philosophy that i
 

83
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
that's the basic philosophy that i
personally have for aikido and i think

84
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
personally have for aikido and i think
 

85
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,590
personally have for aikido and i think
that philosophy lines up with

86
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
that philosophy lines up with
 

87
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,030
that philosophy lines up with
what a lot of people would say their

88
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040

so when we're looking at that we have to
 

93
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,710
so when we're looking at that we have to
identify what problems we're going to

94
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
identify what problems we're going to

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
aikido is a system that should be
 

171
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,869
aikido is a system that should be
available to

172
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
available to
 

173
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,110
available to
anyone right so so that's part of it is

174
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
anyone right so so that's part of it is
 

175
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,710
anyone right so so that's part of it is
we have to face the fact that most of

176
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
we have to face the fact that most of
 

177
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,270
we have to face the fact that most of
the time

178
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
the time
 

179
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,949
the time
the person attacking us is going to be

180
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
the person attacking us is going to be
 

181
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,710
the person attacking us is going to be
bigger and stronger than us

182
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
bigger and stronger than us
 

183
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,390
bigger and stronger than us
now that's going to really kind of limit

184
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
now that's going to really kind of limit
 

185
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,229
now that's going to really kind of limit
us in a lot of ways because most martial

in aikido we're already saying that well
 

213
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,229
in aikido we're already saying that well
we're probably not gonna be

214
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
we're probably not gonna be
 

215
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,830
we're probably not gonna be
the the biggest strongest person the

216
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840

person
so how in the heck are we going to deal

222
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
so how in the heck are we going to deal
 

223
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,430
so how in the heck are we going to deal
with someone else right

224
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
with someone else right
 

225
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,750
with someone else right
so i believe aikido has a set of goals

226
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
so i believe aikido has a set of goals
 

227
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,030
so i believe aikido has a set of goals
that help us with this

228
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
that help us with this
 

229
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,910
that help us with this
right so one of the goals is we want to

230
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
right so one of the goals is we want to
 

231
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,229
right so one of the goals is we want to
be

232
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
be
 

233
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,309
be
ahead of someone else and this goal is

234
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
ahead of someone else and this goal is
 

235
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,149
ahead of someone else and this goal is
so simple that we forget about it all

236
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
so simple that we forget about it all
 

237
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,630
so simple that we forget about it all
the time

238
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
the time
 

239
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,110
the time
right so being ahead means a simple it

240
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
right so being ahead means a simple it
 

241
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,390
right so being ahead means a simple it
could be a simple thing like

242
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
could be a simple thing like
 

243
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,550
could be a simple thing like
um that looks like a dangerous place to

244
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
um that looks like a dangerous place to
 

245
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,550
um that looks like a dangerous place to
go i'm not going to go to that dangerous

246
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
go i'm not going to go to that dangerous
 

247
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,350
go i'm not going to go to that dangerous
place right

248
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
place right
 

249
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,949
place right
that doesn't sound like much of a thing

250
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
that doesn't sound like much of a thing
 

251
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,030
that doesn't sound like much of a thing
but being able to use that in a creative

252
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
but being able to use that in a creative
 

253
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,550
but being able to use that in a creative
way that sometimes can get you out of

254
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
way that sometimes can get you out of
 

255
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,990
way that sometimes can get you out of
really bad situations

256
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
really bad situations
 

257
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,070
really bad situations
is ideal right so one of the main goals

258
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
is ideal right so one of the main goals
 

259
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,670
is ideal right so one of the main goals
of aikido is just to be ahead of our

260
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
of aikido is just to be ahead of our
 

261
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,509
of aikido is just to be ahead of our
attackers and what our attackers know

262
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
attackers and what our attackers know
 

263
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,229
attackers and what our attackers know
and that could be in a in a short frame

264
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
and that could be in a in a short frame
 

265
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,509
and that could be in a in a short frame
right so meaning that

266
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
right so meaning that
 

267
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,789
right so meaning that
i know this guy's going to punch me in a

268
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
i know this guy's going to punch me in a
 

269
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,070
i know this guy's going to punch me in a
minute and i need to do something before

270
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
minute and i need to do something before
 

271
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,869
minute and i need to do something before
he punches me

272
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
he punches me
 

273
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,550
he punches me
or it could be in a big frame like i

274
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
or it could be in a big frame like i
 

275
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,830
or it could be in a big frame like i
don't want to live in that country

276
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
don't want to live in that country
 

277
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,869
don't want to live in that country
because it seems like a dangerous

278
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
because it seems like a dangerous
 

279
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,070
because it seems like a dangerous
country or i don't want to go to that

280
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
country or i don't want to go to that
 

281
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,550
country or i don't want to go to that
place

282
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
place
 

283
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,110
place
now we can't always meet that goal right

284
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
now we can't always meet that goal right
 

285
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,390
now we can't always meet that goal right
so sometimes you're going to have to go

286
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
so sometimes you're going to have to go
 

287
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,990
so sometimes you're going to have to go
places that are potentially dangerous

288
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
places that are potentially dangerous
 

289
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,270
places that are potentially dangerous
or deal with people that are going to be

290
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
or deal with people that are going to be
 

291
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,110
or deal with people that are going to be
potentially dangerous right so we have

292
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
potentially dangerous right so we have
 

293
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,190
potentially dangerous right so we have
to have tactics that enable us to deal

294
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
to have tactics that enable us to deal
 

295
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,750
to have tactics that enable us to deal
with this

296
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
with this
 

297
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,910
with this
but i believe aikido's first main goal

298
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
but i believe aikido's first main goal
 

299
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,670
but i believe aikido's first main goal
is simply to be ahead

300
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
is simply to be ahead
 

301
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,949
is simply to be ahead
right and so that's a way that we could

302
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
right and so that's a way that we could
 

303
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,990
right and so that's a way that we could
definitely deal with people who are

304
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
definitely deal with people who are
 

305
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,350
definitely deal with people who are
bigger and stronger and more skilled

306
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
bigger and stronger and more skilled
 

307
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,750
bigger and stronger and more skilled
than us

308
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
than us
 

309
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,910
than us
is to be ahead of them and i think the

310
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
is to be ahead of them and i think the
 

311
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,949
is to be ahead of them and i think the
founder of aikido

312
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
founder of aikido
 

313
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,629
founder of aikido
talked about this kind of stuff all the

314
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
talked about this kind of stuff all the
 

315
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,069
talked about this kind of stuff all the
time right one of the big things he said

316
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
time right one of the big things he said
 

317
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,990
time right one of the big things he said
was before someone attacks me

318
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
was before someone attacks me
 

319
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,150
was before someone attacks me
i see a little light come out from them

320
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
i see a little light come out from them
 

321
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,430
i see a little light come out from them
and i just move out of the way of the

322
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
and i just move out of the way of the
 

323
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,350
and i just move out of the way of the
light now that sounds kind of mysterious

324
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
light now that sounds kind of mysterious
 

325
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,870
light now that sounds kind of mysterious
and weird but i think what he was saying

326
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
and weird but i think what he was saying
 

327
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,710
and weird but i think what he was saying
was i understand what someone's intent

328
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
was i understand what someone's intent
 

329
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,189
was i understand what someone's intent
is

330
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
is
 

331
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,950
is
before they do it and so i just don't

332
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
before they do it and so i just don't
 

333
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,469
before they do it and so i just don't
