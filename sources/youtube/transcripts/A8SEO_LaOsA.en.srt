1
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,990

so

2
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
so
 

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:02:04,550
so
[Music]

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560

 

5
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:14,949

which

6
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959

 

7
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:31,270

so

8
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280

 

9
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:43,430

boost

10
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440

 

11
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,830

so

12
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840

 

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,750

the technique

14
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
the technique
 

15
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,509
the technique
it looks very simple it looks like a

16
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
it looks very simple it looks like a
 

17
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,270
it looks very simple it looks like a
wrist lock

18
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280

 

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,229

um

20
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239

 

21
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,830

let us note that

22
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
let us note that
 

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,030
let us note that
there are internal aspects

24
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
there are internal aspects
 

25
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,869
there are internal aspects
where it's not a wrist lock in the sense

26
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
where it's not a wrist lock in the sense
 

27
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,790
where it's not a wrist lock in the sense
that energy is actually in throughout

28
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
that energy is actually in throughout
 

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,589
that energy is actually in throughout
his whole body the wrist lock

30
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
his whole body the wrist lock
 

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,390
his whole body the wrist lock
is just in the wrist

32
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
is just in the wrist
 

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,190
is just in the wrist
the

34
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
the
 

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,350
the
energy in his body

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
energy in his body
 

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,309
energy in his body
is i'm here and you're moving you're

38
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
is i'm here and you're moving you're
 

39
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,630
is i'm here and you're moving you're
moving him

40
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
moving him
 

41
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,309
moving him
okay

42
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
okay
 

43
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,550
okay
that starts from the very beginning

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
that starts from the very beginning
 

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,509
that starts from the very beginning
so energy just in his arm

46
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519

 

47
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,030

versus

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
versus
 

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,589
versus
getting his center

50
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
getting his center
 

51
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,430
getting his center
to move

52
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
to move
 

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,750
to move
those are your internal aspects

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
those are your internal aspects
 

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,550
those are your internal aspects
i can't quote you

56
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
i can't quote you
 

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,470
i can't quote you
your strategic aspects are one of

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
your strategic aspects are one of
 

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,229
your strategic aspects are one of
non-contestation

60
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
non-contestation
 

61
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,750
non-contestation
okay

62
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
okay
 

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,030
okay
so you'll have two choices

64
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
so you'll have two choices
 

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,710
so you'll have two choices
one

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
one
 

67
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,589
one
you manipulate his arm

68
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
you manipulate his arm
 

69
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,110
you manipulate his arm
to put it there

70
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120

 

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,589

or you move to where his arm is there do

72
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
or you move to where his arm is there do
 

73
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,789
or you move to where his arm is there do
you understand

74
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
you understand
 

75
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,429
you understand
this that's jiu jitsu okay

76
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
this that's jiu jitsu okay
 

77
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,630
this that's jiu jitsu okay
so

78
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
so
 

79
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,110
so
if i go like this

80
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
if i go like this
 

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,390
if i go like this
this hand

82
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
this hand
 

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,190
this hand
has to be turned down into place and

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
has to be turned down into place and
 

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,750
has to be turned down into place and
then put on place okay

86
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
then put on place okay
 

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,589
then put on place okay
let's just start with the second thing

88
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
let's just start with the second thing
 

89
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,870
let's just start with the second thing
here this has to now be put on place

90
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
here this has to now be put on place
 

91
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,550
here this has to now be put on place
okay

92
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
okay
 

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,509
okay
if i move my chest to it it doesn't have

94
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
if i move my chest to it it doesn't have
 

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,990
if i move my chest to it it doesn't have
to be put on place i will make that

96
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
to be put on place i will make that
 

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,310
to be put on place i will make that
you get it

98
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
you get it
 

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,189
you get it
and

100
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
and
 

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,590
and
if you look at the first move

102
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
if you look at the first move
 

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,830
if you look at the first move
his arm is already turned his arm is

104
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
his arm is already turned his arm is
 

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,870
his arm is already turned his arm is
turned do you see his arm's not here

106
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
turned do you see his arm's not here
 

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,870
turned do you see his arm's not here
because you're in his body

108
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
because you're in his body
 

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,870
because you're in his body
and you're in position

110
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
and you're in position
 

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,909
and you're in position
do you think

112
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
do you think
 

113
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,070
do you think
you're not grabbing it here well guess

114
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
you're not grabbing it here well guess
 

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,870
you're not grabbing it here well guess
what

116
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
what
 

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,870
what
that's not the right place and what ends

118
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
that's not the right place and what ends
 

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,230
that's not the right place and what ends
up happening

120
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
up happening
 

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,030
up happening
is you put his fingers on you you see

122
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
is you put his fingers on you you see
 

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,790
is you put his fingers on you you see
which is why i counted that as not the

124
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
which is why i counted that as not the
 

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,230
which is why i counted that as not the
technique because now you force it

126
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
technique because now you force it
 

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,110
technique because now you force it
that wasn't the technique okay

128
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
that wasn't the technique okay
 

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,270
that wasn't the technique okay
which is why

130
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
which is why
 

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,469
which is why
the other one made sense to your body

132

the other one made sense to your body
you see

134
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
you see
 

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,230
you see
because the knuckles are in place

136
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
because the knuckles are in place
 

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,629
because the knuckles are in place
for no body

138
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
for no body
 

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,590
for no body
this

140
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
this
 

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,230
this
for the wrist lock

142
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
for the wrist lock
 

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,469
for the wrist lock
even this one

144
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
even this one
 

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,150
even this one
better move it's going to hurt yeah

146
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
better move it's going to hurt yeah
 

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,270
better move it's going to hurt yeah
you're going to move don't exist

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
you're going to move don't exist
 

149
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,150

okay

150
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160

 

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,909

but then what we're doing is on the

152
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
but then what we're doing is on the

159
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,990

move

160
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000

378
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
when you guys go to do your wrist locks
 

379
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,150
when you guys go to do your wrist locks
you're actually

380
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
you're actually
 

381
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,389
you're actually
taking it off

382
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
taking it off
 

383
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,350
taking it off
okay

384
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360

 

385
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,310

leave it on leave it on here you feel
 

387
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,389
leave it on leave it on here you feel
the same friction do you see same

388
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
the same friction do you see same
 

389
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,470
the same friction do you see same
friction same

390
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
friction same
 

391
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,790

392
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800

 

393
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,949

so don't push it off for you in your

394
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
so don't push it off for you in your
 

395
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,150
so don't push it off for you in your
attempt to hurt him

396
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160

 

397
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,590

leave it on you leave it on
leave it on it doesn't slip off

400
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
leave it on it doesn't slip off
 

401
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,310
leave it on it doesn't slip off
does not slip off

402
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320

 

403
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,790

okay we talked a lot on those last two

404
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
okay we talked a lot on those last two
 

405
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,230
okay we talked a lot on those last two
parts so i'm not going to say it all

406
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
parts so i'm not going to say it all
 

407
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,150
parts so i'm not going to say it all
again i'm just going to demonstrate it

408
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
again i'm just going to demonstrate it
 

409
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,550
again i'm just going to demonstrate it
so again in summary

410
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
so again in summary
 

411
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,910
so again in summary
uh

412
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
uh
 

413
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,470
uh
as in the podcast today he has to

414
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
as in the podcast today he has to
 

415
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,550
as in the podcast today he has to
organize his body a certain way he has

416
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
organize his body a certain way he has
 

417
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,790
organize his body a certain way he has
to work with energy a certain way a

418
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
to work with energy a certain way a
 

419
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,750
to work with energy a certain way a
prescribed way which designates the art

420
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
prescribed way which designates the art
 

421
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,750
prescribed way which designates the art
and so does uke

422
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
and so does uke
 

423
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,829
and so does uke
and both are doing the exact same thing

424
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
and both are doing the exact same thing
 

425
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,550
and both are doing the exact same thing
but he's doing it from yong and i'm

426
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
but he's doing it from yong and i'm
 

427
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,470
but he's doing it from yong and i'm
doing it from yin as a result of that

428
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
doing it from yin as a result of that
 

429
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,550
doing it from yin as a result of that
as he tries as a young from a young

430
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
as he tries as a young from a young
 

431
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,150
as he tries as a young from a young
aspect to put energy into the whole of

432
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
aspect to put energy into the whole of
 

433
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,790
aspect to put energy into the whole of
my body i as spoken let that energy go

434
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
my body i as spoken let that energy go
 

435
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,350
my body i as spoken let that energy go
into the whole of my body i organize

436
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
into the whole of my body i organize
 

437
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,550
into the whole of my body i organize
myself

438
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
myself
 

439
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,870
myself
and when i do that

440
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
and when i do that
 

441
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,829
and when i do that
i also do not localize

442
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
i also do not localize
 

443
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,509
i also do not localize
the wrist lock

444
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
the wrist lock
 

445
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,550
the wrist lock
okay and then i don't get hurt and then

446
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
okay and then i don't get hurt and then
 

447
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,190
okay and then i don't get hurt and then
i put more of my mass into the technique

448
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
i put more of my mass into the technique
 

449
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,910
i put more of my mass into the technique
and he has to do his part much better

450
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
and he has to do his part much better
 

451
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,150
and he has to do his part much better
because he experiences me as more

452
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
because he experiences me as more
 

453
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,910
because he experiences me as more
unified and thus more heavy okay so i

454
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
unified and thus more heavy okay so i
 

455
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,310
unified and thus more heavy okay so i
just want to show you kimmy aspect of it

456
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
just want to show you kimmy aspect of it
 

457
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:38,310
just want to show you kimmy aspect of it
again okay so my whole body is organized

458
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320

 

459
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,509

and you can see there's no need to go

460
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
and you can see there's no need to go
 

461
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,910
and you can see there's no need to go
but you can see i disorganized and now

462
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
but you can see i disorganized and now
 

463
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,389
but you can see i disorganized and now
his energy is going to get localized

464
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399

 

465
00:12:48,399 --> 00:13:06,150

it's going to move my whole body

466
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160

 

467
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,550

so i don't risk injury

468
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
so i don't risk injury
 

469
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,710
so i don't risk injury
because energy is dispersed

470
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720

 

471
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,110

next point

472
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
next point
 

473
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,910
next point
pay attention to the album

474
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
pay attention to the album
 

475
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,470
pay attention to the album
as i let energy go throughout the whole

it's going to be the elbow so i pay

488
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
it's going to be the elbow so i pay
 

489
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,269
it's going to be the elbow so i pay
attention to the elbow energy

490
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279

i come into his whole body
 

495
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,750
i come into his whole body
through his elbow through his elbow

not his wrist
 

499
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,430

so i go in
 

501
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
so i go in
it's his elbow

502
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
it's his elbow
 

503

now i reach the end of my range of

510
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
now i reach the end of my range of
 

511
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,829
now i reach the end of my range of
motion and the elbow is off

512

motion and the elbow is off
 

513
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,230
motion and the elbow is off
so to transfer that energy

514
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
so to transfer that energy
 

515
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,550
so to transfer that energy
just like you can transfer the energy

516
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
just like you can transfer the energy
 

517
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,629
just like you can transfer the energy
from the yin perspective

from the yin perspective
 

519
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:23,200
