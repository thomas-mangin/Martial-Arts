all keeping well
currently in the uk we're in lockdown

6
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
currently in the uk we're in lockdown
 

7
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,710
currently in the uk we're in lockdown
and with it being winter the weather's

8
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
and with it being winter the weather's
 

9
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,470
and with it being winter the weather's
pretty miserable outside the days are

10
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
pretty miserable outside the days are
 

11
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,350
pretty miserable outside the days are
short

12
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
short
 

13
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,390
short
so there's not really that much

14
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
so there's not really that much
 

15
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,390
so there's not really that much
opportunity to train outside inside

16
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
opportunity to train outside inside
 

17
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,070
opportunity to train outside inside
we're often confined by space and we

18
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
we're often confined by space and we
 

19
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,150
we're often confined by space and we
don't really have that room to train

20
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
don't really have that room to train
 

21
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,630
don't really have that room to train
particularly with weapons today i'm

22
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
particularly with weapons today i'm
 

23
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,470
particularly with weapons today i'm
going to go through some stuff with the

24
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
going to go through some stuff with the
 

25
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,189
going to go through some stuff with the
bakken and maybe give you some ideas to

26
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
bakken and maybe give you some ideas to
 

27
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,990
bakken and maybe give you some ideas to
think about

28
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
think about
 

29
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,870
think about
when training and how that actually

30
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
when training and how that actually
 

31
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,990
when training and how that actually
limited space

32
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
limited space
 

33
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,670
limited space
can sometimes help your technique

34
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680

 

35
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,950

okay to start with let's have a look at

36
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
okay to start with let's have a look at
 

37
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,869
okay to start with let's have a look at
what space i've got around me i've got

38
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
what space i've got around me i've got
 

39
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,470
what space i've got around me i've got
wall behind me

40
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
wall behind me
 

41
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,110
wall behind me
there's a radiator down here the shield

42
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
there's a radiator down here the shield
 

43
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,709
there's a radiator down here the shield
hanging up on the wall

44
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
hanging up on the wall
 

45
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,229
hanging up on the wall
i've got a chair which is probably out

46
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
i've got a chair which is probably out
 

47
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,630
i've got a chair which is probably out
of shot and the table

48
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
of shot and the table
 

49
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,750
of shot and the table
so it's only given me a small space a

50
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
so it's only given me a small space a
 

51
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,510
so it's only given me a small space a
width about that much

52
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
width about that much
 

53
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,630
width about that much
and there's a cabinet over there

54
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
and there's a cabinet over there
 

55
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,950
and there's a cabinet over there
and then there's a door over on this

56
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
and then there's a door over on this
 

57
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,750
and then there's a door over on this
side

58
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
side
 

59
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,910
side
so it's not really much room

60
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
so it's not really much room
 

61
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,030
so it's not really much room
particularly

62
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
particularly
 

63
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,990
particularly
width wise lengthwise i've got a little

64
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
width wise lengthwise i've got a little
 

65
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,469
width wise lengthwise i've got a little
bit

66
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
bit
 

67
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,469
bit
of room maybe a couple of couple of

68
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
of room maybe a couple of couple of
 

69
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,750
of room maybe a couple of couple of
meters

70
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
meters
 

71
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,270
meters
above me it's a normal ceiling height

72
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
above me it's a normal ceiling height
 

73
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,950
above me it's a normal ceiling height
so if i was to get my ken

74
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
so if i was to get my ken
 

75
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,469
so if i was to get my ken
there we go i'm touching the ceiling

76
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
there we go i'm touching the ceiling
 

77
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,190
there we go i'm touching the ceiling
there at that sort of height

78
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
there at that sort of height
 

79
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,510
there at that sort of height
i can just if i stand my top toes reach

80
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
i can just if i stand my top toes reach
 

81
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,390
i can just if i stand my top toes reach
it

82
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
it
 

83
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,670
it
so for most people this

84
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
so for most people this
 

85
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,590
so for most people this
puts them off because they think well

86
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
puts them off because they think well
 

87
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,670
puts them off because they think well
obviously the ceiling is quite low

88
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
obviously the ceiling is quite low
 

89
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,630
obviously the ceiling is quite low
and the tendency might be well if i

90
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
and the tendency might be well if i
 

91
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,990
and the tendency might be well if i
start to raise

92
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
start to raise
 

93
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,630
start to raise
the ken feels like well okay at this

94
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
the ken feels like well okay at this
 

95
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,190
the ken feels like well okay at this
point

96
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
point
 

97
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,630
point
i'm going to be hitting the ceiling so

98
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
i'm going to be hitting the ceiling so
 

99
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,109
i'm going to be hitting the ceiling so
it's it seems like it's too low

100
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
it's it seems like it's too low
 

101
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,030
it's it seems like it's too low
if you watch me here i'll keep my arms

102
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
if you watch me here i'll keep my arms
 

103
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,510
if you watch me here i'll keep my arms
extended

104
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
extended
 

105
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,670
extended
and if you notice the ken isn't hitting

106
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
and if you notice the ken isn't hitting
 

107
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,109
and if you notice the ken isn't hitting
the ceiling

108
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
the ceiling
 

109
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,749
the ceiling
but yeah i'm still able to raise it

110
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
but yeah i'm still able to raise it
 

111
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,830
but yeah i'm still able to raise it
behind my head with my arm extended

112
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
behind my head with my arm extended
 

113
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,109
behind my head with my arm extended
there

114
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
there
 

115
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,550
there
and draw it back down without collapsing

116
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
and draw it back down without collapsing
 

117
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,749
and draw it back down without collapsing
my arms into some funny position

118
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
my arms into some funny position
 

119
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,070
my arms into some funny position
so how do i do that so if any of you see

120
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
so how do i do that so if any of you see
 

121
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,350
so how do i do that so if any of you see
my previous video i talk about

122
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
my previous video i talk about
 

123
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,309
my previous video i talk about
weightlessness

124
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
weightlessness
 

125
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150
weightlessness
i'll link it either above or in the

and i say when we're lifting the

130
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
and i say when we're lifting the
 

131
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,949
and i say when we're lifting the
anything

132
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
anything
 

133
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,790
anything
when you're lifting from underneath here

134
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
when you're lifting from underneath here
 

135
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,949
when you're lifting from underneath here
it's easier and lighter than if you're

136
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
it's easier and lighter than if you're
 

137
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,910
it's easier and lighter than if you're
holding it

138
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
holding it
 

139
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,830
holding it
out here and raising at this point when

140
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
out here and raising at this point when
 

141
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,589
out here and raising at this point when
i push forward i'm using my hips to

142
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
i push forward i'm using my hips to
 

143
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,869
i push forward i'm using my hips to
connect

144
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
connect
 

145
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,910
connect
there so it's acting as a lever when my

146
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
there so it's acting as a lever when my
 

147
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,350
there so it's acting as a lever when my
hips are square

148
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
hips are square
 

149
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,190
hips are square
at this point the rotation point is now

150
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
at this point the rotation point is now
 

151
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,390
at this point the rotation point is now
around my shoulder

152
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
around my shoulder
 

153
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,430
around my shoulder
but the sword is perpendicular to my

154
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
but the sword is perpendicular to my
 

155
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,630
but the sword is perpendicular to my
uh arm and i keep it that way um

156
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
uh arm and i keep it that way um
 

157
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,990
uh arm and i keep it that way um
i don't raise just straight up like this

158
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
i don't raise just straight up like this
 

159
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,150
i don't raise just straight up like this
when i've got it here i'm actually still

160
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
when i've got it here i'm actually still
 

161
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,030
when i've got it here i'm actually still
pushing out

162
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
pushing out
 

163
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,229
pushing out
from this side and as i take it around

164
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
from this side and as i take it around
 

165
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,150
from this side and as i take it around
i'm it's like i'm reaching for the end

166
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
i'm it's like i'm reaching for the end
 

167
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,270
i'm it's like i'm reaching for the end
of the

168

of the
 

169
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,309
of the
the hilt and at this point here that's

170
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
the hilt and at this point here that's
 

171
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,990
the hilt and at this point here that's
where it's really extended

172
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
where it's really extended
 

173
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,149
where it's really extended
like i'm trying to grab up towards it

174
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
like i'm trying to grab up towards it
 

175
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,589
like i'm trying to grab up towards it
and then i pull it back down

176
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
and then i pull it back down
 

177
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,630
and then i pull it back down
for the cut so the motion of the

178
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
for the cut so the motion of the
 

179
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,869
for the cut so the motion of the
the ken isn't going just upwards like

180
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
the ken isn't going just upwards like
 

181
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,309
the ken isn't going just upwards like
this or raising it

182
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319

 

183
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,750

that's what you're not meant to do

184
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
that's what you're not meant to do
 

185
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,030
that's what you're not meant to do
raising in an arc like this

186
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
raising in an arc like this
 

187
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,229
raising in an arc like this
is basically pushing up and then it's

188
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
is basically pushing up and then it's
 

189
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,229
is basically pushing up and then it's
continuing to push up here

190
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
continuing to push up here
 

191
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,869
continuing to push up here
as it raises up like that that's the

192
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
as it raises up like that that's the
 

193
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,509
as it raises up like that that's the
motion

194
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
motion
 

195
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,110
motion
then when it reverses it's actually

196
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
then when it reverses it's actually
 

197
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,190
then when it reverses it's actually
coming forward

198
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
coming forward
 

199
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,789
coming forward
and then down rather than just looping

200
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
and then down rather than just looping
 

201
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,509
and then down rather than just looping
over the top if i was cutting in an arc

202
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
over the top if i was cutting in an arc
 

203
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,710
over the top if i was cutting in an arc
where my arms are just

204
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
where my arms are just
 

205
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,509
where my arms are just
coming down like this all the weight is

206
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
coming down like this all the weight is
 

207
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,229
coming down like this all the weight is
going to be at this

208
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
going to be at this
 

209
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,229
going to be at this
end which is then going to drive my

210
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
end which is then going to drive my
 

211
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,350
end which is then going to drive my
shoulders up

212
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
shoulders up
 

213
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,589
shoulders up
whereas when i push it forwards i can

214
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
whereas when i push it forwards i can
 

215
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,070
whereas when i push it forwards i can
still keep that posture

216
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080

 

217
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,630

without compromising the cut so that was

218
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
without compromising the cut so that was
 

219
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,550
without compromising the cut so that was
the first bury but what else could i do

220
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
the first bury but what else could i do
 

221
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,229
the first bury but what else could i do
well there's a wall here so i can't

222
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
well there's a wall here so i can't
 

223
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,070
well there's a wall here so i can't
really take it round for the fifth

224
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
really take it round for the fifth
 

225
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,949
really take it round for the fifth
sabori

226
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
sabori
 

227
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,149
sabori
and this side there is space so i could

228
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
and this side there is space so i could
 

229
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,350
and this side there is space so i could
always take it round

230
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
always take it round
 

231
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,070
always take it round
raise and cut

232
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080

 

233
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,509

i could do the same again but this time

234
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
i could do the same again but this time
 

235
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,509
i could do the same again but this time
we footwork so i'll change

236
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
we footwork so i'll change
 

237
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,350
we footwork so i'll change
and i'll have my left foot forward and

238
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
and i'll have my left foot forward and
 

239
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,789
and i'll have my left foot forward and
i'll take it around

240
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
i'll take it around
 

241
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,629
i'll take it around
so i load up then i can step and cut

242
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
so i load up then i can step and cut
 

243
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,909
so i load up then i can step and cut
again load up

244
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
again load up
 

245
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,950
again load up
step and cut i could do it obviously on

246
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
step and cut i could do it obviously on
 

247
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,350
step and cut i could do it obviously on
the

248
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
the
 

249
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,310
the
opposite side now the space is on my

250
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
opposite side now the space is on my
 

251
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,390
opposite side now the space is on my
right side

252
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
right side
 

253
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,510
right side
i bring it up and cut so this is just

254
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
i bring it up and cut so this is just
 

255
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,230
i bring it up and cut so this is just
with the

256
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
with the
 

257
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,830
with the
left foot forward now and just shifting

258
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
left foot forward now and just shifting
 

259
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,150
left foot forward now and just shifting
forward

260
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160

 

261
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,550

could also obviously do it with the step

262
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
could also obviously do it with the step
 

263
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,189
could also obviously do it with the step
so

264
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
so
 

265
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,550
so
this time i'll change my feet around so

266
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
this time i'll change my feet around so
 

267
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,710
this time i'll change my feet around so
raise up step and cut

268
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
raise up step and cut
 

269
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:04,150
raise up step and cut
raise up step and cut

270
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160

 

271
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,670

so we could also look at the first two

272
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
so we could also look at the first two
 

273
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,749
so we could also look at the first two
cuts of hapagiri

274
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
cuts of hapagiri
 

275
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,469
cuts of hapagiri
so it starts like the first suburi where

276
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
so it starts like the first suburi where
 

277
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,350
so it starts like the first suburi where
we're raising up

278
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
we're raising up
 

279
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,870
we're raising up
and coin then we turn and cut the

280
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
and coin then we turn and cut the
 

281
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,310
and coin then we turn and cut the
opposite way

282
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
opposite way
 

283
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,070
opposite way
and again we can just continue that

284
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
and again we can just continue that
 

285
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,870
and again we can just continue that
movement going from side to side the way

286
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
movement going from side to side the way
 

287
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,150
movement going from side to side the way
that this works

288
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
that this works
 

289
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,590
that this works
is by keeping the point online and again

290
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
is by keeping the point online and again
 

291
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,670
is by keeping the point online and again
the space helps it stops us

292
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
the space helps it stops us
 

293
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,590
the space helps it stops us
drifting off to the side and doing

294
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
drifting off to the side and doing
 

295
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,790
drifting off to the side and doing
something like this because otherwise

296
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
something like this because otherwise
 

297
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,909
something like this because otherwise
we'd hit the wall

298
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
we'd hit the wall
 

299
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,070
we'd hit the wall
we want to try and keep that point in

300
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
we want to try and keep that point in
 

301
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,629
we want to try and keep that point in
line

302
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
line
 

303
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,270
line
with my body if you like we turn turn

304
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
with my body if you like we turn turn
 

305
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,830
with my body if you like we turn turn
turn

306
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
turn
 

307
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,230
turn
until it's raised right above my head

308
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
until it's raised right above my head
 

309
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,990
until it's raised right above my head
here i want my arms extended like i

310
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
here i want my arms extended like i
 

311
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,110
here i want my arms extended like i
mentioned before

312
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
mentioned before
 

313
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,230
mentioned before
and then we cut down so the the sword

314
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
and then we cut down so the the sword
 

315
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,990
and then we cut down so the the sword
doesn't really leave

316
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
doesn't really leave
 

317
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,469
doesn't really leave
this cent central line so as long as

318
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
this cent central line so as long as
 

319
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,830
this cent central line so as long as
you've got that space

320
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
you've got that space
 

321
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,430
you've got that space
you see i don't actually need that much

322
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
you see i don't actually need that much
 

323
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,110
you see i don't actually need that much
space either side

324
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
space either side
 

325
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,309
space either side
i can just turn

326
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319

 

327
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,670

cut turn cut

328
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
cut turn cut
 

329
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,390
cut turn cut
you can also put a thrust into this

330
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
you can also put a thrust into this
 

331
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,150
you can also put a thrust into this
depending on how much space you have

332
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
depending on how much space you have
 

333
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,189
depending on how much space you have
depends on whether you'll be able to

334
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
depends on whether you'll be able to
 

335
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,029
depends on whether you'll be able to
pull the thrust in if you've got a

336
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
pull the thrust in if you've got a
 

337
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,390
pull the thrust in if you've got a
little bit more space you might be able

338
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
little bit more space you might be able
 

339
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,710
