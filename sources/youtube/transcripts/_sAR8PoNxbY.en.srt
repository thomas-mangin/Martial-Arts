hey you start to think oh yeah that

100
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
hey you start to think oh yeah that
 

101
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,309
hey you start to think oh yeah that
actually adds to it so right

102
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,319
actually adds to it so right
 

103
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,190
actually adds to it so right
so first

104
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
so first
 

105
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,589
so first
subur second subur this is a very

106
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
subur second subur this is a very
 

107
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,110
subur second subur this is a very
difficult subury to do because the hips

108
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
difficult subury to do because the hips
 

109
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,790
difficult subury to do because the hips
have to keep straight not turned

110
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
have to keep straight not turned
 

111
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,229
have to keep straight not turned
so it's a very difficult one so we used

112
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
so it's a very difficult one so we used
 

113
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,470
so it's a very difficult one so we used
to think about there's a big log here

114
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,480
to think about there's a big log here
 

115
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,990
to think about there's a big log here
and there's a blade up there and a

116
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
and there's a blade up there and a
 

117
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,070
and there's a blade up there and a
sawmill and we've got to push this

118
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
sawmill and we've got to push this
 

119
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,350
sawmill and we've got to push this
log like that in a straight line so we

120
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,360
log like that in a straight line so we
 

121
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,830
log like that in a straight line so we
got to push this log in a straight line

122
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:18,840
got to push this log in a straight line
 

123
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,110
got to push this log in a straight line
we mustn't do this and push it

124
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,120
we mustn't do this and push it
 

125
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,750
we mustn't do this and push it
downwards lot of people get confused

126
