9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,350
i've said that i'm going to win this
technique

10
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
technique
 

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,749
technique
now my teaching is on 360 if not

12
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
now my teaching is on 360 if not
 

13
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,390

a lot further over the years and how i

14
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
a lot further over the years and how i
 

15
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,550
a lot further over the years and how i
think about things

16
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
think about things
 

17
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,990
think about things

25
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,990

i can do lots of techniques because

26
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
i can do lots of techniques because
 

27
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,269
i can do lots of techniques because
they're

28
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
they're
 

29
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,590
they're
an armed length

let's say you grab it
and

34
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
and
 

35
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,229
and
i can move over here i can do this so i

36
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
i can move over here i can do this so i
 

37
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,590
i can move over here i can do this so i
can move about

38
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
can move about
 

39
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,790
can move about
it earlier i can move around

40
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
it earlier i can move around
 

41
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,590
it earlier i can move around
so 200 films gonna talk about

42
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600

 

43
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,549

so he's
he's gonna be quite desperate internally

66
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
he's gonna be quite desperate internally
 

67
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,190
he's gonna be quite desperate internally
thinking

68
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
thinking
 

69
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,789
thinking
i don't know i'm getting out of this are

70
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
i don't know i'm getting out of this are

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
pretty much yeah that seems likely
 

75
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,190
pretty much yeah that seems likely
that's right

76
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
that's right
 

77
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,190
that's right
so my turn on the film

78
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
so my turn on the film
 

79
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,230
so my turn on the film

it's difficult or when i get its hand

116
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
it's difficult or when i get its hand
 

117
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,750
it's difficult or when i get its hand
here is it right or should i be here so

118
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
here is it right or should i be here so
 

119
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,309
here is it right or should i be here so
i mean you've got all these things but

120
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
i mean you've got all these things but
 

121
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,270
i mean you've got all these things but
from here

122
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280

 

123
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,030

you know

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
you know
 

125
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,190
you know
from here here's my thing you know i

126
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
from here here's my thing you know i
 

127
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,150
from here here's my thing you know i
don't know how to escape this one
