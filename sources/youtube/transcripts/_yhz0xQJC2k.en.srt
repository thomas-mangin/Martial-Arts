show got you the next
 

277
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,110
show got you the next
um so you're going to try and do that if

278
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,120
um so you're going to try and do that if
 

279
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,270
um so you're going to try and do that if
you've worked out what I'm saying the

280
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,280
you've worked out what I'm saying the
 

281
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,869
you've worked out what I'm saying the
next thing that I noticed when I watched

down see that's

288
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,120

 

289
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,029

technical so I'm not saying don't go

290
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
technical so I'm not saying don't go
 

291
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,469

there yet but when he comes it's the

292
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
there yet but when he comes it's the
 

293
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,189
there yet but when he comes it's the
it's the movement of oh you know just

294
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
it's the movement of oh you know just
 

295
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,510
it's the movement of oh you know just
the movement is enough to fulfill

296
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
the movement is enough to fulfill
 

297
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:36,589
the movement is enough to fulfill
me right so I think enough I think

298
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599

 

299
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,950

um I don't know if this angle's right

300
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
um I don't know if this angle's right
 

301
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,270
um I don't know if this angle's right
hang on don't that angle's right so

302
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
hang on don't that angle's right so
 

303
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,550
hang on don't that angle's right so
you're going to go through that
