and since he used to say
 

15
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,170
and since he used to say
I was senses like you know it's very

16
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,180
I was senses like you know it's very
 

17
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,170
I was senses like you know it's very
simple you complicated in other words

18
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,180
simple you complicated in other words
 

19
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,910
simple you complicated in other words
you add stuff that shouldn't be there

20
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
you add stuff that shouldn't be there
 

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,130
you add stuff that shouldn't be there
it's almost like a very precise

22
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
it's almost like a very precise
 

23
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,570
it's almost like a very precise
technique

24
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:29,580
technique
 

25
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,130
technique
it's on the line

26
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,140
it's on the line
 

27
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,610
it's on the line
I do that I go in it stays on the line

28
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,620
I do that I go in it stays on the line
 

29
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,310
I do that I go in it stays on the line
this comes out

30
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
this comes out
 

31
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,250
this comes out
and I throw him

32
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,260
and I throw him
 

33
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,729
and I throw him
so if I move it at all now

34
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:43,739
so if I move it at all now
 

35
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,049
so if I move it at all now
I said about contradictions

36
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:47,059
I said about contradictions
 

37
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,250
I said about contradictions
like this

38
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,260
like this
 

39
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,970
like this
it stays on the line and then I bring it

40
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:52,980
it stays on the line and then I bring it
 

41
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,029
it stays on the line and then I bring it
and then

42
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:56,039

 

43
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,650

so I'm saying

44
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:57,660
so I'm saying
 

45
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,110
so I'm saying
it's a contradiction because I'm saying

46
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
it's a contradiction because I'm saying
 

47
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,330
it's a contradiction because I'm saying
don't disturb them but now I'm saying

48
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,340
don't disturb them but now I'm saying
 

49
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,670
don't disturb them but now I'm saying
disturb them but I'm not going both ways

50
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
disturb them but I'm not going both ways
 

51
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,730
disturb them but I'm not going both ways
so in my first book I always say don't

52
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:07,740
so in my first book I always say don't
 

53
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,109
so in my first book I always say don't
go backwards to go forwards so I mean

54
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119

 

55
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,030

we don't know we're doing it we can't

56
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
we don't know we're doing it we can't
 

57
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,789
we don't know we're doing it we can't
see we're doing it but you don't need to

58
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
see we're doing it but you don't need to
 

59
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,890
see we're doing it but you don't need to
do it

60
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:24,900

 

61
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,570

if you want to turn you turn

62
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:29,580

 

63
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,830

one way

64
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840

 

65
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,249

oh we've got lunch now so after lunch

66
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:37,259
oh we've got lunch now so after lunch
 

67
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,170
oh we've got lunch now so after lunch
um

68
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,180
um
 

69
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,969
um
I think this is the best I've actually

70
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:40,979
I think this is the best I've actually
 

71
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,310
I think this is the best I've actually
ever seen you've worked I know we've

72
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320
ever seen you've worked I know we've
 

73
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,870
ever seen you've worked I know we've
done a few seminars here but you're

74
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
done a few seminars here but you're
 

75
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,069
done a few seminars here but you're
certainly working well because there's

76
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
certainly working well because there's
 

77
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,510
certainly working well because there's
not a lot of chats

78
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
not a lot of chats
 

79
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,030
not a lot of chats
so that means two things one is your not

80
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
so that means two things one is your not
 

81
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,889
so that means two things one is your not
only concentrating but you must be

82
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899
only concentrating but you must be
 

83
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,590
only concentrating but you must be
working as well so that's like uh you're

84
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
working as well so that's like uh you're
 

85
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,350
working as well so that's like uh you're
getting it that's the point when we get

86
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
getting it that's the point when we get
 

87
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,690
getting it that's the point when we get
it we you know I bet those who use

88
00:01:59,690 --> 00:01:59,700
it we you know I bet those who use
 

89
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,429
it we you know I bet those who use
computers someone will talk to you guys

90
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439

calculate oh you threw me out there I've
 

109
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,470
calculate oh you threw me out there I've
got a program that I I could almost read

110
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
got a program that I I could almost read
 

111
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,910
got a program that I I could almost read
your mind then you went and threw me

112
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
your mind then you went and threw me

really done that have we right so so so
 

117
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,010
really done that have we right so so so
we get programmed as well

118
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,020
we get programmed as well
 

119
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,229
we get programmed as well
even though the book is sign it we get

120
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
even though the book is sign it we get
 

121
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,690
even though the book is sign it we get
this program and that's what we have to

122
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
this program and that's what we have to
 

123
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,670
this program and that's what we have to
then overcome

124
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,680
then overcome
 

125
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,570
then overcome
no not to be programmed or you could say

126
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:49,580
no not to be programmed or you could say

you knew it before they said it so we

130
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:55,620
you knew it before they said it so we
 

131
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,589
you knew it before they said it so we
have to keep fighting all these things

132
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
have to keep fighting all these things
 

133
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,229
have to keep fighting all these things
that make us

134
00:02:59,229 --> 00:02:59,239
that make us
 

135
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,949
that make us
impurities so that we become natural

136
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
impurities so that we become natural
 

137
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,280
impurities so that we become natural
okay enjoy
