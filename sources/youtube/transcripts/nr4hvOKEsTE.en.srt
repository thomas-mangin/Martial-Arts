example you know Josh and I were here

54
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,270
example you know Josh and I were here
 

55
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,690

and I was in a a regular Ken come I or
something like this and Joshua was just

58
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,290
something like this and Joshua was just

this out to a one-handed strike you can

62
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:22,639
this out to a one-handed strike you can
 

63
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,520
this out to a one-handed strike you can
see now that I'm easily able to hit him

64
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,530
see now that I'm easily able to hit him
 

65
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,529

right so by using one hand they get more

66
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:26,539
right so by using one hand they get more
 

67
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,569
right so by using one hand they get more
reach than I would normally get also

68
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:28,579
reach than I would normally get also
 

69
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,129
reach than I would normally get also
could be that my hand the weapon got

70
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:30,139
could be that my hand the weapon got
 

71
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,959
could be that my hand the weapon got
knocked free in my hand and how can I

72
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,969
knocked free in my hand and how can I
 

73
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,120
knocked free in my hand and how can I
reset that so that I could use it again

74
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,130
reset that so that I could use it again
 

75
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,529
reset that so that I could use it again
and this is a lot of what we're seeing

76
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:35,539
and this is a lot of what we're seeing
 

77
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,480
and this is a lot of what we're seeing
in this series we're gonna look at the

78
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,490
in this series we're gonna look at the
 

79
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,769
in this series we're gonna look at the
gaming guys trying to have a really nice

partner savuti that I think explains a

82
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:41,029
partner savuti that I think explains a
 

83
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:43,029
partner savuti that I think explains a
lot about this and kind of also explains

84
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:43,039
lot about this and kind of also explains
 

85
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,830
lot about this and kind of also explains
x-mas which directions with me here for

86
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,840
x-mas which directions with me here for
 

87
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,440
x-mas which directions with me here for
this also really does a nice job of

88
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,450
this also really does a nice job of
 

89
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,080
this also really does a nice job of
showing how we can be deceptive with our

90
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,090
showing how we can be deceptive with our

Suba action so Suba is this action the

92
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
Suba action so Suba is this action the

sliding action so if Josh and I were

94
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
sliding action so if Josh and I were
 

95
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,639
sliding action so if Josh and I were
here and I could step in and thrust him

96
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:57,649
here and I could step in and thrust him
 

97
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,289
here and I could step in and thrust him
right so he's in distance right now I

98
00:01:59,289 --> 00:01:59,299
right so he's in distance right now I
 

99
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,879
right so he's in distance right now I
could successfully step in and get him

100
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:00,889
could successfully step in and get him
 

101
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,519
could successfully step in and get him
and josh has answered this was simply

102
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,529
and josh has answered this was simply
 

103
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:06,249
and josh has answered this was simply
the step back okay now we know that

104
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:06,259
the step back okay now we know that
 

105
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,100
the step back okay now we know that
every time I attack Josh can just step

106
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,110
every time I attack Josh can just step
 

107
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,140
every time I attack Josh can just step
back one out of range right so he's got

108
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,150
back one out of range right so he's got
 

109
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,970
back one out of range right so he's got
an idea of my distancing now of course I

110
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:12,980
an idea of my distancing now of course I
 

111
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,040
an idea of my distancing now of course I
can hop in further but he could also hop

112
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,050
can hop in further but he could also hop
 

113
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,620
can hop in further but he could also hop
out further so at this distancing every

114
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:17,630
out further so at this distancing every
 

115
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,390
out further so at this distancing every
time I chased this guy down he's gonna

116
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400
time I chased this guy down he's gonna
 

117
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,160
time I chased this guy down he's gonna
be able to successfully get away from me

118

but what if every time he hits me he's
hopping back so fast he gets out of

him so by using that top a series like

244
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:27,650
him so by using that top a series like
 

245
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,380
him so by using that top a series like
that I'm getting a lot of reach a lot of

successfully defend what's going on
right so so if he knocks it free from my

256
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
right so so if he knocks it free from my
 

257
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,380
right so so if he knocks it free from my
hand and what am I going to do so we

were in some kind of position and Josh

260
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:42,920
were in some kind of position and Josh
 

261
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,890
were in some kind of position and Josh
for maybe to use like a coal barrage for

262
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:44,900
for maybe to use like a coal barrage for
 

263
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,810
for maybe to use like a coal barrage for
example and knocked the weapon over my

264
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:46,820
example and knocked the weapon over my
 

265
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,210
example and knocked the weapon over my
hand in this position it's not really

266
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,220
hand in this position it's not really
 

267
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,950
hand in this position it's not really
too much I can do I need to get my hand

268
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
too much I can do I need to get my hand
 

269
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,180
too much I can do I need to get my hand
back to my weapon but while I'm doing

270
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,190
back to my weapon but while I'm doing
 

271
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,220
back to my weapon but while I'm doing
that maybe he's attacking me all kinds

272
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,230
that maybe he's attacking me all kinds
 

273
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,380
that maybe he's attacking me all kinds
of bad stuff happening right but if I

274
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,390
of bad stuff happening right but if I
 

275
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,730
of bad stuff happening right but if I
were to use something like hot you know

276
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:57,740
were to use something like hot you know
 

277
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,530
were to use something like hot you know
you guys better I need to come in here I

278
00:04:59,530 --> 00:04:59,540
you guys better I need to come in here I
 

279
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,270
you guys better I need to come in here I
can immediately give him working right

280
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
can immediately give him working right
 

281
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,010
can immediately give him working right
so even if I don't hit him I get him to

282
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,020
so even if I don't hit him I get him to
 

283
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,920
so even if I don't hit him I get him to
back up off of me here so that way he's

284
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:05,930
back up off of me here so that way he's
 

285
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,450
back up off of me here so that way he's
away from me and the hot you know you

286
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,460
away from me and the hot you know you
 

287
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,890
away from me and the hot you know you
guys shouldn't set me up in that kind of

288
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:08,900
guys shouldn't set me up in that kind of
 

289
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,030
guys shouldn't set me up in that kind of
position there's lots of things we can

290
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,040
position there's lots of things we can
 

291
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,860
position there's lots of things we can
work with with this I could use a

292
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:11,870
work with with this I could use a
 

293
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,200
work with with this I could use a
changing of range in the same way so

294
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,210
changing of range in the same way so
 

295
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,030
changing of range in the same way so
let's say Jobs was in a Khimki mine and

296
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,040
let's say Jobs was in a Khimki mine and
 

297
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,650
let's say Jobs was in a Khimki mine and
I'm in a joke of mine now I'm in a

298
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:17,660
I'm in a joke of mine now I'm in a
 

299
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,270
I'm in a joke of mine now I'm in a
serious disadvantage she's got a nice

300
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
serious disadvantage she's got a nice
 

301
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,480
serious disadvantage she's got a nice
long reach when he comes in for me I hop

302
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,490
long reach when he comes in for me I hop
 

303
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,370
long reach when he comes in for me I hop
back out of range and now I immediately

304
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,380
back out of range and now I immediately
 

305
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,470
back out of range and now I immediately
have a long ranging weapon to come in

306
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:26,480
have a long ranging weapon to come in
 

307
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,120
have a long ranging weapon to come in
and hit him with so because I switched

308
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,130
and hit him with so because I switched
 

309
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,970
and hit him with so because I switched
this here now I step in I have a huge

310
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:30,980
this here now I step in I have a huge
 

311
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,560
this here now I step in I have a huge
roots that I can come back at this guy

312
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,570
roots that I can come back at this guy
 

313
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,240
roots that I can come back at this guy
