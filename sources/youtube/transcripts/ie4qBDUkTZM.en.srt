1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,629

so they came up with this sixth Joe

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
so they came up with this sixth Joe
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,150
so they came up with this sixth Joe
Carter because of

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,160
Carter because of
 

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,190

8
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
but it's 13 14 15 16 17 18.
 

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,349
but it's 13 14 15 16 17 18.
so that's all there is is being taken

10
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
so that's all there is is being taken
 

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,670
so that's all there is is being taken
out of that

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
out of that
 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,810
out of that
31 and made into a six

14
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:23,820
31 and made into a six
 

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,109
31 and made into a six
but what I dealt was I decided I would

16
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
but what I dealt was I decided I would
 

17
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,970
but what I dealt was I decided I would

do it with Apartments
oh

20
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,380
oh
 

21
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,010
oh
we'll we'll get to this as the class

22
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,020
we'll we'll get to this as the class
 

23
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,889
we'll we'll get to this as the class
guys but because we're head on we're

24
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:36,899
guys but because we're head on we're
 

25
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,530
guys but because we're head on we're
going to step each side of the line so

26
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:39,540
going to step each side of the line so
 

27
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,930
going to step each side of the line so
I'm going to step this side of the line

28
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:41,940
I'm going to step this side of the line
 

29
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,450
I'm going to step this side of the line
and the next movement we're both going

30
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,460
and the next movement we're both going
 

31
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,209
and the next movement we're both going
to set the other side of the line

32
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:47,219
to set the other side of the line
 

33
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,770
to set the other side of the line
and then we're going to go back to the

34
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:48,780
and then we're going to go back to the
 

35
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,310
and then we're going to go back to the
other side come into the middle

36
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
other side come into the middle
 

37
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,470
other side come into the middle
come back

38
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
come back
 

39
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,250
come back
so so I decided I'd do that the reason I

40
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,260
so so I decided I'd do that the reason I
 

41
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,470
so so I decided I'd do that the reason I
done it was so that we start to

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
done it was so that we start to
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,349
done it was so that we start to
understand the movement we understand

44
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
understand the movement we understand
 

45
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,929
understand the movement we understand
moving them so

46
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:05,939
moving them so
 

47
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:14,990
moving them so
stretch

48
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000

 

49
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,910

then when it gets a bit more interesting

50
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
then when it gets a bit more interesting
 

51
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,350
then when it gets a bit more interesting
I decided let's make it five movements

52
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
I decided let's make it five movements
 

53
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,969
I decided let's make it five movements
and we've got the edge

54
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:28,979

 

55
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,929

so

56
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939

 

57
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,690

we go

58
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:35,700

 

59
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,490

all right so

60
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:37,500
all right so
 

61
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,410
all right so
Edge Mini

62
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:42,420

 

63
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,789

so

64
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:43,799
so
 

65
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,030
so
she

66
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,040
she
 

67
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,469
she
maybe mix one Edge

68
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,479

 

69
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:01,010

then you miss one okay

70
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020

 

71
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,410

and you miss me yeah

72
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,420

 

73
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,109

and then you eventually bring down the

74
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
and then you eventually bring down the
 

75
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,210
and then you eventually bring down the
line

76
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
line
 

77
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:26,770
line
foreign

78
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:26,780
