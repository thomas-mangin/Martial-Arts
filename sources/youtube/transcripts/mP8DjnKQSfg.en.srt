uh yeah

00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:51,500
uh yeah

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,869
uh yeah
it's very common to being a grid so he

it's very common to being a grid so he
 

13
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,029
it's very common to being a grid so he
came in from 12 and I throw two six no

00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
came in from 12 and I throw two six no

so he got behind me

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
so he got behind me
 

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,230
so he got behind me
not here and then I sent him down

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240

 

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,270

we're gonna go over this way

26
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,280
we're gonna go over this way
 

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,230
we're gonna go over this way
so my spiraling geometry oh we'll go

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
so my spiraling geometry oh we'll go
 

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,210
so my spiraling geometry oh we'll go
this way

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:26,220
this way
 

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,030

the changing review icon here

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
the changing review icon here
 

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,030
the changing review icon here
the icon range I wrote

34
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,040
the icon range I wrote
 

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,469
the icon range I wrote
there

36
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
there
 

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,730
there
I'm gonna bring him around

38
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:40,740

 

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,270

that's what allows me to attack his leg

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
that's what allows me to attack his leg
 

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,830
that's what allows me to attack his leg
okay so this leg I'm going to load right

42
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
okay so this leg I'm going to load right
 

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,090
okay so this leg I'm going to load right
there it is

44
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,100
there it is
 

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:58,490
there it is
okay this now I can attack it this way

46
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:58,500

 

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,270

so we'll do

48
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
so we'll do
 

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,670
so we'll do
on me and I'm gonna get that whole thing

50
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
on me and I'm gonna get that whole thing
 

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,230
on me and I'm gonna get that whole thing
turning because

52
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
turning because
 

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,370
turning because
with one big

54
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,380

 

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,229

two of those

56
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
