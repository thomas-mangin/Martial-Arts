can't manipulate because years ago they
 

211
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,590
can't manipulate because years ago they
would manipulate the body

212
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
would manipulate the body
 

213
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,550
would manipulate the body
and they said what they found out was

214
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
and they said what they found out was
 

215
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,150
and they said what they found out was
the body's

so just as about they go to adjust the
 

223
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,030
so just as about they go to adjust the

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
muscle
 

225
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,990
muscle
the person would spasm and they couldn't

226
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
the person would spasm and they couldn't
 

227
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,230
the person would spasm and they couldn't
get it unless they really sort of done

228
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
get it unless they really sort of done
 

229

some very vigorous

230
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
some very vigorous
 

231
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,030
some very vigorous
so i realized that in iccio what i sense

232
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
so i realized that in iccio what i sense
 

233
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,510
so i realized that in iccio what i sense
he gave us as the first technique and

234
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
he gave us as the first technique and
 

235
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,990
he gave us as the first technique and
it's really quite a horrible technique

236
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
it's really quite a horrible technique
 

237
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,629
it's really quite a horrible technique
to get any feedback

238
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
to get any feedback
 

239
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,189
to get any feedback
but if you do this

240
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
but if you do this
 

241
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,029
but if you do this
he sees

242
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
he sees
 

243
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,469
he sees
his muscle won't stiffen up

244
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
his muscle won't stiffen up
 

245
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,749
his muscle won't stiffen up
because

246
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
because
 

247
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,350
because
he hasn't felt

248
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
he hasn't felt
 

249
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,029
he hasn't felt
that

250
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
that
 

251
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,350
that
so i took this from the chiropractor so

252
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
so i took this from the chiropractor so
 

253
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,990
so i took this from the chiropractor so
this is how aikido in daily life can

254
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
this is how aikido in daily life can
 

255
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,469
this is how aikido in daily life can
teach us about the body

256
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
teach us about the body
 

257
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,150
teach us about the body
if i go here

258
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
if i go here
 

259
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,110
if i go here
without

260
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
without
 

261
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,390
without
him knowing he will

262
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
him knowing he will
 

263
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,710
him knowing he will
automatically have tighter muscles he

264
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
automatically have tighter muscles he
 

265
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,270
automatically have tighter muscles he
will be harder to so your most of you

266
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
will be harder to so your most of you
 

267
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,350
will be harder to so your most of you
know how hard it is to get somebody down

268
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
know how hard it is to get somebody down
 

269
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,189
know how hard it is to get somebody down
in ikea if they don't want to go

270
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
in ikea if they don't want to go
 

271
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,189
in ikea if they don't want to go
so their mind is sort of saying go on

272
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
so their mind is sort of saying go on
 

273
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,430
so their mind is sort of saying go on
then you know put it on

274
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
then you know put it on
 

275
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,150
then you know put it on
so this splash so we've got two things

276
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
so this splash so we've got two things
 

277
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,270
so this splash so we've got two things
in this

278
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
in this
 

279
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,430
in this
program this

280
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
program this
 

281
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,629
program this
splash means that yes i've got him here

282
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
splash means that yes i've got him here
 

283
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,710
splash means that yes i've got him here
what he was what his mind won't know

284
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
what he was what his mind won't know
 

285
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,309
what he was what his mind won't know
about

286
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
about
 

287
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,189
about
because this is what his eyes saw and

288
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
because this is what his eyes saw and
 

289
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,230
because this is what his eyes saw and
thought was gonna do the work

290
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
thought was gonna do the work
 

291
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,189
thought was gonna do the work
so

292
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
so
 

293
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,749
so
so now when i do that

294
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
so now when i do that
 

295
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,990
so now when i do that
he doesn't realize how easy he goes down

296
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
he doesn't realize how easy he goes down
 

297
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,309
he doesn't realize how easy he goes down
without a lot of fuss

298
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319

 

299
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,189

so

300
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
so
 

301
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,070
so
i come in

302
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080

 

303
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,110

that's very very difficult to do

304
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
that's very very difficult to do
 

305
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,230
that's very very difficult to do
i now

306
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
i now
 

307
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,990
i now
rewind that

308
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
rewind that
 

309
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,150
rewind that
with this motion

310
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160

 

311
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,110

and

312
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
and
 

313
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,870
and
it brings up

314
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
it brings up
 

315
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,670
it brings up
the rest of the technique

316
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680

 

317
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,350

that's how you've got

318
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
that's how you've got
 

319
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,830
that's how you've got
up the breastbone

320
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

321
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,469

splash

322
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
splash
 

323
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,629
splash
flap down

324
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
flap down
 

325
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,390
flap down
and then that part

326
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
and then that part
 

327
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,670
and then that part
so now

328
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
so now
 

329
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,350
so now
taking it a bit more

330
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
taking it a bit more
 

331
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,790
taking it a bit more
it's really difficult because you've

332
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
it's really difficult because you've
 

333
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,870
it's really difficult because you've
added all these things and you've got to

334
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
added all these things and you've got to
 

335
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,270
added all these things and you've got to
add a tem is in

336
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
add a tem is in
 

337
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,990
add a tem is in
what will attempt to his mind but oh

338
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
what will attempt to his mind but oh
 

339
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,230
what will attempt to his mind but oh
there wasn't a reaction so that means it

340
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
there wasn't a reaction so that means it
 

341
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,029
there wasn't a reaction so that means it
was a good attempt

342
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
was a good attempt
 

343
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,550
was a good attempt
see

344
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
see
 

345
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,790
see

it's difficult now to get him down here
 

361
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,550
it's difficult now to get him down here
because now he's costing my path and

it's difficult because i'm coming

380
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
it's difficult because i'm coming
 

381
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,110
it's difficult because i'm coming
directly out

382
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
directly out
 

383
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,550
directly out

386
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
just scoot off so that if he was to cut
 

387
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,909
just scoot off so that if he was to cut
me with a sword or anything

390
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
i'd be that's why you've been doing
 

391
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,430
i'd be that's why you've been doing
weapons all this time

392
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
weapons all this time
 

393

395
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,110

so

396
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120

 

397
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,309

now

398
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
now
 

399
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,749
now
i can just walk through easily that path

400
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
i can just walk through easily that path
 

401
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,870
i can just walk through easily that path
without

402
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880

so

406
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
so
 

407
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,990
so

408
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000

411
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,550
me well i understood a long while ago it
took me so many years to realize why

412
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
took me so many years to realize why
 

413
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,389
