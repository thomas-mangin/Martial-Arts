have these problems with sparring
 

25
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,070
have these problems with sparring
one of the biggest issues and it's it's

26
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
one of the biggest issues and it's it's
 

27
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,390
one of the biggest issues and it's it's
honestly a hard issue to see is that

28
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
honestly a hard issue to see is that
 

29
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,709
honestly a hard issue to see is that
sparring literally means struggle and

30
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
sparring literally means struggle and
 

31
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,470
sparring literally means struggle and
aikido is a martial art that attempts to

32
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
aikido is a martial art that attempts to
 

33
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,790
aikido is a martial art that attempts to
not

34
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
not
 

35
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,110
not
struggle with anything so the very act

36
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
struggle with anything so the very act
 

37
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,709
struggle with anything so the very act
of sparring in lots of ways

38
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
of sparring in lots of ways
 

39
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,549
of sparring in lots of ways
is the antithesis of what we want to do

40
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
is the antithesis of what we want to do
 

41
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,549
is the antithesis of what we want to do
in aikido and perhaps why the founders

42
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
in aikido and perhaps why the founders
 

43
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,549
in aikido and perhaps why the founders
said that we shouldn't have that kind of

44
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
said that we shouldn't have that kind of
 

45
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,630
said that we shouldn't have that kind of
competition in aikido so one of the many

46
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
competition in aikido so one of the many
 

47
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,150
competition in aikido so one of the many
reasons probably actually

48
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
reasons probably actually
 

49
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,430
reasons probably actually
but so that's one of the inherent

50
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
but so that's one of the inherent
 

51
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,110
but so that's one of the inherent
problems however iqr does have some

52
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
problems however iqr does have some
 

53
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,150
problems however iqr does have some
struggle methods

struggle methods

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,830
struggle methods
and for those struggle methods we do

56
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
and for those struggle methods we do
 

57
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,590
and for those struggle methods we do
need to have some kind of sparring

58
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
need to have some kind of sparring
 

59
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,310

so that aside um how do i suggest that

180
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
so that aside um how do i suggest that
 

181
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,670
so that aside um how do i suggest that
we start to get better at it

182
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
we start to get better at it
 

183
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,470
we start to get better at it
so the first thing you have to

184
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
so the first thing you have to
 

185
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,630
so the first thing you have to
understand is aikido's broke into two

186
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
understand is aikido's broke into two
 

187
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,589
understand is aikido's broke into two
categories

188
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
categories
 

189
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,869
categories
one category is ikea

190
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
one category is ikea
 

191
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,229
one category is ikea
the other category is kumiuchi

192
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
the other category is kumiuchi
 

193
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,990
the other category is kumiuchi
so there's a bunch of different things

194
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
so there's a bunch of different things
 

195
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
so there's a bunch of different things
we do in aikido there's a main division

196
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
we do in aikido there's a main division
 

197
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,149
we do in aikido there's a main division
of three one is uh ashi or tai sabaki

198
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
of three one is uh ashi or tai sabaki
 

199
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,270
of three one is uh ashi or tai sabaki
how you use your body

200

how you use your body
 

201
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,750
how you use your body
and then we have uh ikea and we have

202
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
and then we have uh ikea and we have
 

203
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,030
and then we have uh ikea and we have
kumiuchi

204
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
kumiuchi
 

205
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,270
kumiuchi
so kumiuchi means struggle methods it's

206
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
so kumiuchi means struggle methods it's
 

207
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,949
so kumiuchi means struggle methods it's

means how we're gonna struggle back and
forth

216
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
forth
 

217
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,990
forth
and wrestle around right so that's what

218
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
and wrestle around right so that's what
 

219
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,509

have the kumiuchi because sometimes we

228
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
have the kumiuchi because sometimes we
 

229
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,430
have the kumiuchi because sometimes we

ego and you'll see how we can start to
 

373
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,990
ego and you'll see how we can start to
develop some skills

374
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
develop some skills
 

375
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,870

so maya's not allowed to move her feet
and josh is allowed to move his feet and

498
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
and josh is allowed to move his feet and
 

499
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,469
and josh is allowed to move his feet and
what josh is going to do is move around

500
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
what josh is going to do is move around
 

501
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,589
what josh is going to do is move around
maya

502
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
maya
 

503
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,430
maya
and try and find the breaking points of

504
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
and try and find the breaking points of
 

505
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,870
and try and find the breaking points of
her grip right so

506
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
her grip right so
 

507
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,469
her grip right so
where are those breaking points in her

508
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
where are those breaking points in her
 

509
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,309
where are those breaking points in her
grip and right now what josh is doing is

510
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
grip and right now what josh is doing is
 

511
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,070
grip and right now what josh is doing is
he's taking her right to the edge every

512
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
he's taking her right to the edge every
 

513
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,670
he's taking her right to the edge every
time and then he's letting her set back

514
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
time and then he's letting her set back
 

515
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,670
time and then he's letting her set back
up to a basically a balanced position

516
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
up to a basically a balanced position
 

517
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,309
up to a basically a balanced position
right so

518
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
right so
 

519
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,070
right so
as he's moving through that's all he's

520
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
as he's moving through that's all he's
 

521
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,430
as he's moving through that's all he's
doing okay

522
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
doing okay
 

523
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,950
doing okay

maya
how to use her our flexibility in her

532
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
how to use her our flexibility in her
 

533
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,270
how to use her our flexibility in her
body to compensate for what josh is

534
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
body to compensate for what josh is
 

535

doing so
 

537
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,430
doing so
she's not working on grip strength or

538
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
she's not working on grip strength or
 

539
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,029
she's not working on grip strength or
anything she's just using flexibility in

540
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
anything she's just using flexibility in
 

541
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,950
anything she's just using flexibility in
her body to track what josh is up to

542
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
her body to track what josh is up to
 

543
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,749
her body to track what josh is up to
okay second thing we're training josh is

where
 

547
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,550
where
he can move that her grip's right about

548
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
he can move that her grip's right about
 

549
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,150
he can move that her grip's right about
to break so he's learning

550
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
to break so he's learning
 

551
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,990
to break so he's learning
what positions he can be in that her

552
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
what positions he can be in that her
 

553
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,350
what positions he can be in that her
grip is about to break

554
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
grip is about to break
 

555
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,589

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
not to try and break her grip all the
 

561
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,070
not to try and break her grip all the
time but try and get right to the edge

562
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
time but try and get right to the edge
 

563
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,430
time but try and get right to the edge
of where her grip breaks

564
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
of where her grip breaks
 

565
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,749
of where her grip breaks
and then stop there and move to a new

566
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
and then stop there and move to a new
 

567
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,550
and then stop there and move to a new
position

568
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
position
 

569
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,710
position
now maya's also told not to move her

570
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
now maya's also told not to move her
 

571
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,710
now maya's also told not to move her
feet so what happens is we get a very

572
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
feet so what happens is we get a very
 

573
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,189
feet so what happens is we get a very
a semi-live practice starting to happen

574
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
a semi-live practice starting to happen
 

575
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,710
a semi-live practice starting to happen
it's not really live but

576
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
it's not really live but
 

577
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,150
it's not really live but
we're starting to get these guys moving

578
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
we're starting to get these guys moving
 

579
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,150
we're starting to get these guys moving
in that kind of way and exploring and

580
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
in that kind of way and exploring and
 

581
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,430
in that kind of way and exploring and
learning and thinking about things and

582
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
learning and thinking about things and
 

583
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,309
learning and thinking about things and
so this is a good

584
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
so this is a good
 

585
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,909
so this is a good
practice to start people off no one's

586
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
practice to start people off no one's
 

587
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,430
practice to start people off no one's
going to get hurt doing this

588
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
going to get hurt doing this
 

589
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,710
going to get hurt doing this
and people can start to understand

590
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
and people can start to understand
 

591
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,790
and people can start to understand
what's going on plus at this point if

592
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
what's going on plus at this point if
 

593
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,629
what's going on plus at this point if
our egos start to kick in too much

594
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
our egos start to kick in too much
 

595
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,230
our egos start to kick in too much
we can say hey that's not the practice

596
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
we can say hey that's not the practice

what this half of the drill this part of

638
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
what this half of the drill this part of
 

639
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,550
what this half of the drill this part of
the drill is doing

640
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
the drill is doing
 

641
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,710
the drill is doing
is it's doing the opposite sets for each

642
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
is it's doing the opposite sets for each
 

643
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,710
is it's doing the opposite sets for each
of these guys right now maya's learning

644
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
of these guys right now maya's learning
 

645
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,550
of these guys right now maya's learning
to move her feet with her flexible body

646
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
to move her feet with her flexible body
 

647
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,070
to move her feet with her flexible body
whereas before she wasn't she was just

648
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
whereas before she wasn't she was just
 

649
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,670
whereas before she wasn't she was just
depending upon the flexible body but

650
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
depending upon the flexible body but
 

651
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,110
depending upon the flexible body but
there's a part where your body's gonna

652
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
there's a part where your body's gonna
 

653
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,870
there's a part where your body's gonna
break right so your grip will break

654
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
break right so your grip will break
 

655
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,230
break right so your grip will break
and and that's what we explored before

656
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
and and that's what we explored before
 

657
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,750
and and that's what we explored before
but now maya can move her feet to

658
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
but now maya can move her feet to
 

659
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,030
but now maya can move her feet to
compensate for that

660
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
compensate for that
 

661
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,949
compensate for that
we're also teaching josh to go right for

662
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
we're also teaching josh to go right for
 

663
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,790
we're also teaching josh to go right for
the kill right how to explode and pop

664
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
the kill right how to explode and pop
 

665
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,670
the kill right how to explode and pop
his hand free so

666
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
his hand free so
 

667
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,509
his hand free so
now josh is doing different than he did

668
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
now josh is doing different than he did
 

669
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,790
now josh is doing different than he did
before not trying to find the perfect

670
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
before not trying to find the perfect
 

671
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,630
before not trying to find the perfect
angle but just trying to use explosive

672
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
angle but just trying to use explosive
 

673
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,269
angle but just trying to use explosive
action

674
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
action
 

675
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,110
action
this also means that mai is having to

676
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
this also means that mai is having to
 

677
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,190
this also means that mai is having to
train for this explosive action as well

678
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
train for this explosive action as well
 

679
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,630
train for this explosive action as well
so now we're getting these guys doing

680
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
so now we're getting these guys doing
 

681
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,310
so now we're getting these guys doing
something that is truly live

682
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
something that is truly live
 

683
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,990
something that is truly live
it's truly an explosion to try and

684
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
it's truly an explosion to try and
 

685
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,670
it's truly an explosion to try and
escape and mine's trying to compensate

686
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
escape and mine's trying to compensate
 

687
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,190
escape and mine's trying to compensate
for that right so now you can see

688
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
for that right so now you can see
 

689
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,110
for that right so now you can see
we filled in the gaps the problems we

690
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
we filled in the gaps the problems we
 

691
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,310
we filled in the gaps the problems we
were having with the second practice

692
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
were having with the second practice
 

693
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,389
were having with the second practice
again though we have basically a pretty

694
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
again though we have basically a pretty
 

695
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,430
again though we have basically a pretty
safe practice

696
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
safe practice
 

697
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,750
safe practice
now this practice will bruise your ego

698
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
now this practice will bruise your ego
 

699
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,030
now this practice will bruise your ego

knife is probably going to get free most
the time so

708
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
the time so
 

709
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,630

713
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,269
you can go well it's so stacked against
me that

714
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
me that
 

715
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,710
me that
you know and and look the truth is

716
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
you know and and look the truth is

you know and and look the truth is
you're going to have to get over your

718
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
you're going to have to get over your
 

719
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,870
you're going to have to get over your
ego eventually and that's what we're

720
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
ego eventually and that's what we're
 

721
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,230
ego eventually and that's what we're
building towards but it's going to hurt

722
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
building towards but it's going to hurt
 

723
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,790
building towards but it's going to hurt
at first

724
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
at first
 

725
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,310
at first

okay so that's the second stage on this
 

729
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,269
okay so that's the second stage on this
progression

730
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
progression
 

731
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,710
progression
third stage on this progression is

732
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
third stage on this progression is
 

733
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,550
third stage on this progression is
they're going to start in an uh catacly

excellent all right good okay now we
 

765
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,430
excellent all right good okay now we
start to have a really fun practice and

766
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
start to have a really fun practice and
 

767
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,710
start to have a really fun practice and
that's a very fun practice

768
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
that's a very fun practice
 

769
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,630
that's a very fun practice
that's live it's got all kinds of live

770
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
that's live it's got all kinds of live
 

771
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,870
that's live it's got all kinds of live
stuff going on now is it extreme

772
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
stuff going on now is it extreme
 

773
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,630
stuff going on now is it extreme
absolutely not extreme you're probably

774
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
absolutely not extreme you're probably
 

775
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,790
absolutely not extreme you're probably
going to get zero injuries off of this

776
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
going to get zero injuries off of this
 

777
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,190
going to get zero injuries off of this
right

778
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
right
 

779
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,030
right
it's pretty reasonable the injuries you

780
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
it's pretty reasonable the injuries you
 

781
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,949
it's pretty reasonable the injuries you
get will be stupidity injuries right so

782
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
get will be stupidity injuries right so
 

783
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,990
get will be stupidity injuries right so
people jabbing themselves

784
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
people jabbing themselves
 

785
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,030
people jabbing themselves
in the head with the knife because

786
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
in the head with the knife because
 

787
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,550
in the head with the knife because
they're not used to moving with a knife

788
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
they're not used to moving with a knife
 

789
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,310
they're not used to moving with a knife
people pulling the knife into their body

790
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
people pulling the knife into their body
 

791
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,670
people pulling the knife into their body
because they're stupid and not used to

792
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
because they're stupid and not used to
 

793
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,230
because they're stupid and not used to
doing that

794
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
doing that
 

795
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,230
doing that
these will be things that suss out all

796
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
these will be things that suss out all
 

797
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,590
these will be things that suss out all
the beginning problems you're going to

798
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
the beginning problems you're going to
 

799
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,990
the beginning problems you're going to
have

800
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
have
 

801
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,470
have
so this is a really basic practice to

802
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
so this is a really basic practice to
 

803
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,190
so this is a really basic practice to
get through

804
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
get through
 

805
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,630
get through
i would recommend if you've never done

806
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
i would recommend if you've never done
 

807
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,230
i would recommend if you've never done
any sparring in your school to work on

808
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
any sparring in your school to work on
 

809
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,990
any sparring in your school to work on
this three-stage progression

810
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
this three-stage progression
 

811
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,990
this three-stage progression
for a while right so get your students

812
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
for a while right so get your students
 

813
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,590
for a while right so get your students
doing it until it's really comfortable

814
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
doing it until it's really comfortable
 

815
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,269
doing it until it's really comfortable
and so you can generally just jump into

816
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
and so you can generally just jump into
 

817
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,629
and so you can generally just jump into
stage three and no one's going to be

818
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
stage three and no one's going to be
 

819
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,750
stage three and no one's going to be
going crazy

820
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
going crazy
 

821
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,230
going crazy
uh and attacking each other now when

822
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
uh and attacking each other now when
 

823
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,829
uh and attacking each other now when
we're talking about like high stress

824
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
we're talking about like high stress
 

825
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,590
we're talking about like high stress
situations you will need that to get

826
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
situations you will need that to get
 

827
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,990
situations you will need that to get
good

828
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
good
 

829
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,269
good
but at first you don't want to have a

830
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
but at first you don't want to have a
 

831
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,550
but at first you don't want to have a
lot of that because these guys aren't

832
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
lot of that because these guys aren't
 

833
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,310
lot of that because these guys aren't
used to taking the kind of explosive

834
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
used to taking the kind of explosive
 

835
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,590
used to taking the kind of explosive
action they're going to hurt each other

836
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
action they're going to hurt each other
 

837
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,990
action they're going to hurt each other
so

838
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
so
 

839
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,590
so
don't let them hurt each other at first

840
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
don't let them hurt each other at first
 

841
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,190
don't let them hurt each other at first
ease them into it this three-stage

842
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
ease them into it this three-stage
 

843
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,990
ease them into it this three-stage
progression is really

844
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
progression is really
 

845
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,310
progression is really
good okay now this three-stage

846
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
good okay now this three-stage
 

847
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,750
good okay now this three-stage
progression once you've done it for a

848
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
progression once you've done it for a
 

849
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,829
progression once you've done it for a
while this can begin to get into what we

850
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
while this can begin to get into what we
 

851
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,949
while this can begin to get into what we
call kaishiwaza

852
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
call kaishiwaza
 

853
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,230
call kaishiwaza
and so when i started working with the

854
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
and so when i started working with the
 

855
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,069
and so when i started working with the
guys in the garage years ago after they

856
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
guys in the garage years ago after they
 

857
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,870
guys in the garage years ago after they
could all do this

858
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
could all do this
 

859
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,710
could all do this
pretty well then what i did was i

860
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
pretty well then what i did was i
 

861
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,470
pretty well then what i did was i
transitioned us into what we call

862
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
transitioned us into what we call
 

863
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,829
transitioned us into what we call
kaishiwaza

864
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
kaishiwaza
 

865
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,949
kaishiwaza
in japanese kaishi means to turn over so

866
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
in japanese kaishi means to turn over so
 

867
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,030
in japanese kaishi means to turn over so
the idea of this practice is to turn

868
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
the idea of this practice is to turn
 

869
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,269
the idea of this practice is to turn
over who's doing what that's the actual

870
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
over who's doing what that's the actual
 

871
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,550
over who's doing what that's the actual
goal in this practice

872
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
goal in this practice
 

873
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,310
goal in this practice
is to turn it over turn it over turn it

874
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
is to turn it over turn it over turn it
 

875
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,750
is to turn it over turn it over turn it
over now again i have a little

876
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
over now again i have a little
 

877
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,670
over now again i have a little
progression that we use to get us up to

878
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
progression that we use to get us up to
 

879
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,190
progression that we use to get us up to
a full kaishiwaza

880
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
a full kaishiwaza
 

881
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,110
a full kaishiwaza
and this progression is built to get

882
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
and this progression is built to get
 

883
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,550
and this progression is built to get
skills as we go

884
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
skills as we go
 

885
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,389
skills as we go
in the safest manner possible so we're

886
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
in the safest manner possible so we're
 

887
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,990
in the safest manner possible so we're
not getting a ton of injuries right so i

888
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
not getting a ton of injuries right so i
 

889
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,190
not getting a ton of injuries right so i
don't want a ton of injuries from our

890
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
don't want a ton of injuries from our
 

891
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,670
don't want a ton of injuries from our
guys

892
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
guys
 

893
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,990
guys

from this practice okay
 

897
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,990
from this practice okay
now we could say the beginning practice

898
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
now we could say the beginning practice
 

899
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,670
now we could say the beginning practice
was a kaishi was a practice the one we

900
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
was a kaishi was a practice the one we
 

901
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,110
was a kaishi was a practice the one we
just did the stage three for the last

902
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
just did the stage three for the last
 

903
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,550
just did the stage three for the last
practice but it's really not it's more a

904
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
practice but it's really not it's more a
 

905
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,710
practice but it's really not it's more a
hadoke practice an escaping practice

906
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
hadoke practice an escaping practice
 

907
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,310
hadoke practice an escaping practice
but now we're actually going to add the

908
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
but now we're actually going to add the
 

909
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,790
but now we're actually going to add the
idea of kaishi so as they're moving and

910
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
idea of kaishi so as they're moving and
 

911
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,550
idea of kaishi so as they're moving and
just move kind of slow right now so

912
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
just move kind of slow right now so
 

913
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,069
just move kind of slow right now so
so this is just so i can talk about it

914
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
so this is just so i can talk about it
 

915
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,350
so this is just so i can talk about it
you guys can kind of watch them move

916
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
you guys can kind of watch them move
 

917
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,829
you guys can kind of watch them move
okay

918
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
okay

what's going to happen in this is maya
 

921
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,670
what's going to happen in this is maya
is allowed to try and get

922
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
is allowed to try and get
 

923
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,069
is allowed to try and get
basic disarms so as they're moving

924
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
basic disarms so as they're moving
 

925
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,829
basic disarms so as they're moving
around maya's tried to work a disarm now

926
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
around maya's tried to work a disarm now
 

927

okay so he's working around working

940
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
okay so he's working around working
 

941
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,069
okay so he's working around working
around ah now josh got the knife now he

around ah now josh got the knife now he
 

943
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,629
around ah now josh got the knife now he
comes in right right so sorry we're

944
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
comes in right right so sorry we're
 

945
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,069
comes in right right so sorry we're
going to be at a top door every time

946
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
going to be at a top door every time
 

947
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,509
going to be at a top door every time
right so this is our basic practice

948
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
right so this is our basic practice
 

949
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:39,990
right so this is our basic practice
right and

950
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
right and
 

951
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,269
right and
and they're going a couple steps ahead

952
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
and they're going a couple steps ahead
 

953
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,030
and they're going a couple steps ahead
but that's okay all right so you guys

954
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
but that's okay all right so you guys
 

955
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,470
but that's okay all right so you guys
see the idea all right

956
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
see the idea all right
 

957
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,829
see the idea all right
so that's what's going to happen with

958
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
so that's what's going to happen with
 

959
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,990
so that's what's going to happen with
this practice is that uh we start in the

960
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
this practice is that uh we start in the
 

961
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,430
this practice is that uh we start in the
katakedori every time

962
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
katakedori every time
 

963
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,030
katakedori every time
the hadoki stuff's still happening so

964
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
the hadoki stuff's still happening so
 

965
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,230
the hadoki stuff's still happening so
the guy with the knife is trying to make

966
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
the guy with the knife is trying to make
 

967
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,870
the guy with the knife is trying to make
hidoki

968
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
hidoki
 

969
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,550
hidoki
but the other person is allowed to go

970
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
but the other person is allowed to go
 

971
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,550
but the other person is allowed to go
into disarms now what you want to start

972
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
into disarms now what you want to start
 

973
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,230
into disarms now what you want to start
to watch at this phase and we'll get

974
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
to watch at this phase and we'll get
 

975
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,269
to watch at this phase and we'll get
into this but at this

976
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
into this but at this
 

977
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,430
into this but at this
phase we shouldn't see maya going into

978
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
phase we shouldn't see maya going into
 

979
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,590
phase we shouldn't see maya going into
any kind of morote for extended periods

980
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
any kind of morote for extended periods
 

981
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,069
any kind of morote for extended periods
of time so show morote maya for extended

982
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
of time so show morote maya for extended
 

983
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,430
of time so show morote maya for extended
period of time right so see if she's got

984
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
period of time right so see if she's got
 

985
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,230
period of time right so see if she's got
two on one

986
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
two on one
 

987
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,910
two on one
and then what's gonna tend to happen is

988
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
and then what's gonna tend to happen is
 

989
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,590
and then what's gonna tend to happen is
from this you're gonna get this person

990
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
from this you're gonna get this person
 

991
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,710
from this you're gonna get this person
who's got a lot of ego they're gonna

992
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
who's got a lot of ego they're gonna
 

993
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,590
who's got a lot of ego they're gonna
start to go like

994
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
start to go like
 

995
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,189
start to go like
this and hold it for a long time and

996
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
this and hold it for a long time and
 

997
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,629
this and hold it for a long time and
then josh is trying to make hidoki and

998
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
then josh is trying to make hidoki and
 

999
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,069
then josh is trying to make hidoki and
this person's just doing this

1000
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
this person's just doing this
 

1001
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,829
this person's just doing this
and nothing's happening right so that's

1002
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
and nothing's happening right so that's
 

1003
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,910
and nothing's happening right so that's
not skill developing right it's just

1004
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
not skill developing right it's just
 

1005
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,670
not skill developing right it's just
force developing right and we can do

1006
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
force developing right and we can do
 

1007
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,189
force developing right and we can do
that later it's a fair part of this

1008
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
that later it's a fair part of this
 

1009
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,949
that later it's a fair part of this
practice but in the beginning watch that

00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
practice but in the beginning watch that
 

1011
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,350
practice but in the beginning watch that
right

1012
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360

1013
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,470
right
so as they're going and josh is trying

1014
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480

that right
okay also a thing you're gonna have to

1028
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
okay also a thing you're gonna have to
 

1029
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,110
okay also a thing you're gonna have to
work watch for in this practice is

1030
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
work watch for in this practice is
 

1031
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,590
work watch for in this practice is
people

1032
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
people
 

1033
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,550
people
not going back to the katate dory grip

1034
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
not going back to the katate dory grip
 

1035
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,949
not going back to the katate dory grip
so

1036
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
so
 

1037
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,790
so
if josh makes his hidoki in this right

1038
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
if josh makes his hidoki in this right
 

1039
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,069
if josh makes his hidoki in this right
so he is really trying to get free the

1040
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
so he is really trying to get free the
 

1041

so he is really trying to get free the
whole time

1042
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
whole time
 

1043
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,870
whole time
then what he does is he plays this game

1044
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880

 

1045
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,470

uh this is nothing quite the game this

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,590
oh i'm a knife fighting guy right okay
so this is what tends to happen a lot is

1056
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
so this is what tends to happen a lot is
 

1057
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,269
so this is what tends to happen a lot is
you want to play out a fantasy and

1058
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
you want to play out a fantasy and
 

1059
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,710
you want to play out a fantasy and
pretend like you're steven seagal in the

1060
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
pretend like you're steven seagal in the
 

1061
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,509
pretend like you're steven seagal in the
movies okay

1062
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
movies okay
 

1063
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,110
movies okay
you're not stephen segall in the movies

1064
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
you're not stephen segall in the movies
 

1065
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,710
you're not stephen segall in the movies
right this is not a movie it's a dojo

1066
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
right this is not a movie it's a dojo
 

1067
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,430
right this is not a movie it's a dojo
and you're training

1068
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
and you're training
 

1069
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,790
and you're training
and so that's not what's going on so you

1070
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
and so that's not what's going on so you
 

1071
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,550
and so that's not what's going on so you
got to watch that tendency to do that

1072
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
got to watch that tendency to do that
 

1073
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,550
got to watch that tendency to do that
so that's why at this stage they're just

1074
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
so that's why at this stage they're just
 

1075
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,069
so that's why at this stage they're just
putting their arm back out there and the

1076
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
putting their arm back out there and the
 

1077
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,350
putting their arm back out there and the
other person gets to grab it and we

1078
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
other person gets to grab it and we
 

1079
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,230
other person gets to grab it and we
don't go

1080
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
don't go
 

1081
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,069
don't go
until they've got to this stage

1082
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
until they've got to this stage
 

1083
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,829
until they've got to this stage

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,189
okay there now she could try and keep
josh away which would be a successful

1156
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
josh away which would be a successful
 

1157
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,350
josh away which would be a successful
strategy if the goal was to train maya

1158
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
strategy if the goal was to train maya
 

1159
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,350
strategy if the goal was to train maya
to be a murderer with knives but right

1160
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
to be a murderer with knives but right
 

1161
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,870
to be a murderer with knives but right
now that's not the goldenest drill

1162
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
now that's not the goldenest drill
 

1163
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,710
now that's not the goldenest drill
okay so what maya is going to do instead

1164
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
okay so what maya is going to do instead
 

1165
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,470
okay so what maya is going to do instead
of just giving him a katate

1166
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
of just giving him a katate
 

1167
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,470
of just giving him a katate
she's going to start to slowly shoot her

1168
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
she's going to start to slowly shoot her
 

1169
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,910
she's going to start to slowly shoot her
hand in there and this is going to give

1170
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
hand in there and this is going to give
 

1171
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,550
hand in there and this is going to give
josh the ability to get a basic defense

1172
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
josh the ability to get a basic defense
 

1173
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,790
josh the ability to get a basic defense
and go back into working his disarms

1174
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
and go back into working his disarms
 

1175
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,470
and go back into working his disarms
right so that's what we're going back

1176
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
right so that's what we're going back
 

1177
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,230
right so that's what we're going back
and back fourth through fourth okay

1178
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
and back fourth through fourth okay
 

1179
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,150
and back fourth through fourth okay
so you can see this is the idea the

1180
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
so you can see this is the idea the
 

1181
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,230
so you can see this is the idea the
practice is that every time you get an

1182
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
practice is that every time you get an
 

1183
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,749
practice is that every time you get an
escape you're going to kind of give it

1184
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
escape you're going to kind of give it
 

1185
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,030
escape you're going to kind of give it
back to them now look

1186
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
back to them now look
 

1187
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,550
back to them now look
that's not the ultimate we're going to

1188
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
that's not the ultimate we're going to
 

1189
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,829
that's not the ultimate we're going to
get to the ultimate where you're really

1190
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
get to the ultimate where you're really
 

1191
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,789
get to the ultimate where you're really
working that knife

1192
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
working that knife
 

1193
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,549
working that knife
but in this set of drills we can't work

1194
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
but in this set of drills we can't work
 

1195
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,470
but in this set of drills we can't work
on that so it's another important thing

1196
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
on that so it's another important thing
 

1197
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,829
on that so it's another important thing
when you start teaching people

1198

stage and once you get up to this stage
 

1369
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,909
stage and once you get up to this stage
you can add harder practices right so

1370

with the other drills so you've got to
 

1385
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,230
with the other drills so you've got to
divorce them of that right so the idea

1386
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
divorce them of that right so the idea
 

1387
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,909
divorce them of that right so the idea
is always to train them to use

1388

they're actually
 

1545
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,029
they're actually
wrestling over the knife right so it's a

1546
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
wrestling over the knife right so it's a
 

1547
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,310
wrestling over the knife right so it's a
little bit more of an extreme practice

1548
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
little bit more of an extreme practice
 

1549
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,950
little bit more of an extreme practice
where they're actually

1559
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,190
fact a lot of times i'll refer to this
kind of stuff

1560
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
kind of stuff
 

1561
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,070
kind of stuff
as aikido adjacent because it's not

we're only looking at a tiny fraction of
what is aikido when we're looking at

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
what is aikido when we're looking at

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,110
what is aikido when we're looking at
that stuff

that stuff
 

1573
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,789
that stuff
but that is the way you'll have to train

1574
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
but that is the way you'll have to train
 

1575
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,269
but that is the way you'll have to train
kumiuchi so kumiuchi is sparring

1576
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
kumiuchi so kumiuchi is sparring
 

1577
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,590
kumiuchi so kumiuchi is sparring
grappling struggle stuff so we've got to

1578
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
grappling struggle stuff so we've got to
 

1579
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,190
grappling struggle stuff so we've got to
be able to get good at that in case our

1580
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
be able to get good at that in case our
 

1581
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,990
be able to get good at that in case our
ikey fails

1582
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
ikey fails
 

1583
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,269
ikey fails
but that's not where we should put the

1584
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
but that's not where we should put the
 

1585
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,950
but that's not where we should put the
majority of our practice if you want to

1586
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
majority of our practice if you want to
 

1587
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,630
majority of our practice if you want to
put the majority of your practice there

1588
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
put the majority of your practice there

put the majority of your practice there
you should just study jiu jitsu right go

1590
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
you should just study jiu jitsu right go
 

1591
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,190
you should just study jiu jitsu right go
to a good jiu jitsu school or judo

1592
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
to a good jiu jitsu school or judo
 

1593
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,630
to a good jiu jitsu school or judo
school and work on that kind of stuff

1594
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
school and work on that kind of stuff
 

1595
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,430
school and work on that kind of stuff
because

1596
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
because
 

1597
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,269
because
if you want to just master that practice

1598
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
if you want to just master that practice
 

1599
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,870
if you want to just master that practice
those schools will be better at teaching

1600
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
those schools will be better at teaching
 

1601
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,710
those schools will be better at teaching
you that stuff than any aikido school

1602
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
you that stuff than any aikido school
 

1603
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,269
you that stuff than any aikido school
will

1604
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
will
 

1605
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,350
will
but aikido is teaching you to do it in a

1606
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
but aikido is teaching you to do it in a
 

1607
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,950
but aikido is teaching you to do it in a
brief moment so you can get free and

1608
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
brief moment so you can get free and
 

1609
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,870
brief moment so you can get free and
reset your aikido strategies

1610
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
reset your aikido strategies
 

1611
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,710
reset your aikido strategies
so this is going to be a two-parter in

1612
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
so this is going to be a two-parter in
 

1613
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,029
so this is going to be a two-parter in
the next series we'll talk about

1614
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
the next series we'll talk about
 

1615
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,269
the next series we'll talk about
eye key and and live practice for ikey

1616
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
eye key and and live practice for ikey
 

1617
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,190
eye key and and live practice for ikey
and why sparring practices don't really

1618
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
and why sparring practices don't really
 

1619
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,870
and why sparring practices don't really
work for that and why the majority of

1620
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
work for that and why the majority of
 

1621
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,750
work for that and why the majority of
your practice

1622
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
your practice
 

1623
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,669
your practice
shouldn't be sparring practices but you

1624
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
shouldn't be sparring practices but you
 

1625
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,510
shouldn't be sparring practices but you
guys will have to understand this stuff

1626
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
guys will have to understand this stuff
 

1627
00:24:59,520 --> 00:24:59,990
guys will have to understand this stuff
in order to

1628
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
in order to
 

1629
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,549
in order to
have a complete view of aikido so this

1630
