goes down at the same time got it and
it's not you don't want to be square at

22
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
it's not you don't want to be square at

00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
this point in the edema
 

25
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,030
this point in the edema
you're parallel to his spine

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
you're parallel to his spine
 

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,069
you're parallel to his spine
okay

28
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
okay
 

29
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,590
okay
you're here

00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
inside of his elbow as you come around
 

41
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,470
inside of his elbow as you come around
you're not just laying this thing down

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
you're not just laying this thing down
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,470
you're not just laying this thing down
in order to stay on the inside of his

it is just to
 

55
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,310
it is just to
the outside of my spot here's my spine

56
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
the outside of my spot here's my spine
 

57
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,429
the outside of my spot here's my spine
here's his elbow okay

58
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
here's his elbow okay
 

59
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,830
here's his elbow okay
if you just come around you see your

60
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
if you just come around you see your
 

61
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,630
if you just come around you see your
spine is now on the outside of his elbow

62
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
spine is now on the outside of his elbow
 

63

spine is now on the outside of his elbow
you're not on the inside of his elbow

64
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
you're not on the inside of his elbow
 

65
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,910
you're not on the inside of his elbow
so your knee has to pass each other

66
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
so your knee has to pass each other
 

67
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,270
so your knee has to pass each other
and then goes into chico

68
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and then goes into chico
 

69
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,190
and then goes into chico
and then i'm not going to let you out

70
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
and then i'm not going to let you out
 

71
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,190
and then i'm not going to let you out
this time you'll tap

the back leg the back foot
 

75
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,469
the back leg the back foot
comes in under

comes in under
and that is

78
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
and that is
 

79
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,630
and that is
your turn

80
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
your turn
 

81
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,830
your turn
that provides pressure from the inside

82
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
that provides pressure from the inside
 

83
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,830
that provides pressure from the inside
to his

to his
 

85
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:05,430
to his
elbow and then you finish the sheep

together now your center's on the inside

94
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
together now your center's on the inside
 

95
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,670
together now your center's on the inside
of his elbow

step up and you have this trap here

98
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
step up and you have this trap here
 

99
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,270
step up and you have this trap here
okay so use that as a

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
okay so use that as a
 

101
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,190
okay so use that as a
a benchmark

you go now don't move more than i'm
 

115
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,070
you go now don't move more than i'm
moving you though okay don't run away

116
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
moving you though okay don't run away
 

117
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,990
moving you though okay don't run away

all right
 

135
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,710
all right
let's try it

136
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720

 

137
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,710

so remember kihon laza is just a series

138
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
so remember kihon laza is just a series
 

139
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,790
so remember kihon laza is just a series
of connected

140
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
of connected
 

141
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,589
of connected
micro drills okay it's not one long

142
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
micro drills okay it's not one long
 

143
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,270
micro drills okay it's not one long
narrative it disappears that way because

144
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
narrative it disappears that way because
 

145
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,869
narrative it disappears that way because
really out of a lack of

146
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
really out of a lack of
 

147
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,030
really out of a lack of
experience or

148
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
experience or
 

149
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,509
experience or
knowledge is you can't see all the

150
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
knowledge is you can't see all the
 

151
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,070
knowledge is you can't see all the
little pieces you just see this one long

152
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
little pieces you just see this one long
 

153
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,710
little pieces you just see this one long
thing okay

154
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
thing okay
 

155
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,030
thing okay
and

156
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
and
 

157
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,990
and
when you cut to the end for example you

158
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
when you cut to the end for example you
 

159
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,149
when you cut to the end for example you
cut to the end

160
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
cut to the end
 

161
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,030
cut to the end
here like this

162
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
here like this
 

163
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,110
here like this
you're going like this kind of stuff

164
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
you're going like this kind of stuff
 

165
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,830
you're going like this kind of stuff
it's like you met you left out some key

166
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
it's like you met you left out some key
 

167
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,830
it's like you met you left out some key
pieces

168
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
pieces
 

169
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,509
pieces
okay um

170
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
okay um
 

171
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,869
okay um
so

172

so
 

173
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,990
so
though

174
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000

correct chico
okay your patella can only turn on the

288
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
okay your patella can only turn on the
 

289
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,670
okay your patella can only turn on the
mat you cannot slide it on the mat okay

290
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
mat you cannot slide it on the mat okay
 

291
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,550
mat you cannot slide it on the mat okay
so

292
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
so
 

293
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,270
so
as i come around

294
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
as i come around
 

295
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,590
as i come around
where's weight

296
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
where's weight
 

297
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,150
where's weight
where's weight inside me on the inside

298
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
where's weight inside me on the inside
 

299
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,990
where's weight inside me on the inside
knee not on the outside knee so that's

300
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
knee not on the outside knee so that's
 

301
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,629
knee not on the outside knee so that's
not sliding on the mat do you see

302
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
not sliding on the mat do you see
 

303
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,230
not sliding on the mat do you see
and now

304
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
and now
 

305
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,870
and now
let's ask if my inside patella slides on

306
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
let's ask if my inside patella slides on
 

307
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,629
let's ask if my inside patella slides on
the mat

308
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639

 

309
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,909

now it turns it spins on the mat you see

310
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
now it turns it spins on the mat you see
 

311
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,390
now it turns it spins on the mat you see
so when you're not attacking the elbow

312
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
so when you're not attacking the elbow
 

313
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,390
so when you're not attacking the elbow
in this way and you come around like

314
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
in this way and you come around like
 

315
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,430
in this way and you come around like
this

316
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
this
 

317
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,909
this
guess what that has to do slide on the

318
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
guess what that has to do slide on the
 

319
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,870
guess what that has to do slide on the
mat okay you can only turn it on the mat

mat okay you can only turn it on the mat
that way you don't get hurt

322
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
that way you don't get hurt
 

323
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,870
that way you don't get hurt
so your hair

00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
to
 

349
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,110
to
let go of one hand and keep the same

350
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
let go of one hand and keep the same
 

351
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,029
let go of one hand and keep the same
control and you might have to draw a

352
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
control and you might have to draw a
 

353
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,189
control and you might have to draw a
weapon you might have to deflect another

354
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
weapon you might have to deflect another
 

355
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,029
weapon you might have to deflect another
strike you might have to talk on the

356
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
strike you might have to talk on the
 

357
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,670
strike you might have to talk on the
radio or whatever okay so try it again

358
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680

 

359
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,589

okay so as as i come around here

360
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
okay so as as i come around here
 

361
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,629
okay so as as i come around here
and i project right

362
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639

 

363
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,029

you have levels of understanding what is

364
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
you have levels of understanding what is
 

365
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,749
you have levels of understanding what is
going on what is going on here i would

366
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
going on what is going on here i would
 

367
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,550
going on what is going on here i would
say the easiest level why which is the

368
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
say the easiest level why which is the
 

369
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,629
say the easiest level why which is the
most commonly understood

370
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
most commonly understood
 

371
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,430
most commonly understood
is you kind of take his line of gravity

372
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
is you kind of take his line of gravity
 

373
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,670
is you kind of take his line of gravity
outside his basic support

374
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
outside his basic support
 

375
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,230
outside his basic support
and he he goes down do you get he loses

376
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
and he he goes down do you get he loses
 

377
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,670
and he he goes down do you get he loses
balance because his line of gravity fell

378
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
balance because his line of gravity fell
 

379
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,830
balance because his line of gravity fell
outside his base of support

380
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840

 

381
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,469

that's not it okay

382
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
that's not it okay
 

383
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,309
that's not it okay
that is not there's no spiritual

384
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
that is not there's no spiritual
 

385
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,550
that is not there's no spiritual
component to that there's no martial

386
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
component to that there's no martial
 

387
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,629
component to that there's no martial
component to that martially what a

388
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
component to that martially what a
 

389
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,390
component to that martially what a
person does is they move their basic

390
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
person does is they move their basic
 

391
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,790
person does is they move their basic
support back under their line of gravity

392
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
support back under their line of gravity
 

393
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,950
support back under their line of gravity
so you don't establish kozushi it

394
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
so you don't establish kozushi it
 

395
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
so you don't establish kozushi it
doesn't happen okay

396
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,490
doesn't happen okay
 

397
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,270
doesn't happen okay

the next level of understanding let's

400
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
the next level of understanding let's
 

401
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,950
the next level of understanding let's
say generally speaking

402
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
say generally speaking
 

403
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,350
say generally speaking
is you actually are bracing on the map

404
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
is you actually are bracing on the map
 

405
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,189
is you actually are bracing on the map
you're you're bracing he's pushing on

406
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
you're you're bracing he's pushing on
 

407
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,110
you're you're bracing he's pushing on
you and you have like a bracing angle

408
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
you and you have like a bracing angle
 

409
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,589
you and you have like a bracing angle
here do you see that and then you're

410
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
here do you see that and then you're
 

411
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,230
here do you see that and then you're
just gonna overpower him

412
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
just gonna overpower him
 

413
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,990
just gonna overpower him
into this

414
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
into this
 

415
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,189
into this
so i'm on one side and i'm pushing

416
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
so i'm on one side and i'm pushing
 

417
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,309
so i'm on one side and i'm pushing
him who's on the other side again that

418
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
him who's on the other side again that
 

419
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,870
him who's on the other side again that
is not spiritually uh

420
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
is not spiritually uh
 

421
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,310
is not spiritually uh
worth anything

422
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
worth anything
 

423
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,269
worth anything
and also partially it all it will work

424
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
and also partially it all it will work
 

425
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,870
and also partially it all it will work
if you're stronger than the person it

426
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
if you're stronger than the person it
 

427
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,389
if you're stronger than the person it
won't work if you're not stronger than

428
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
won't work if you're not stronger than
 

429
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,630
won't work if you're not stronger than
the person okay

430
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640

 

431
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,790

what's actually going on

is
 

435
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,269
is
his energy that we say comes down onto

436
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
his energy that we say comes down onto
 

437
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,190
his energy that we say comes down onto
the ground vector do you

438
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
the ground vector do you
 

439
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,949
the ground vector do you
that's what the person

440
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
that's what the person
 

441
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,710
that's what the person

understand
 

445
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,470
understand
they think that's bracing okay

446
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
they think that's bracing okay
 

447
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,949
they think that's bracing okay
his energy is passing through me you can

448

his energy is passing through me you can
 

449
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,829
his energy is passing through me you can
just imagine like a ghost or something

those three to go oh okay it's like that
 

457
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,310
those three to go oh okay it's like that
that's what comes to the ground and that

458
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
that's what comes to the ground and that
 

459
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,230
that's what comes to the ground and that
does not pass through the ground it

460
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
does not pass through the ground it
 

461
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,550
does not pass through the ground it
bounces back through me again goes

462
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
bounces back through me again goes
 

463
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,350
bounces back through me again goes
because look and it goes back into him

464
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
because look and it goes back into him
 

465
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,670
because look and it goes back into him
okay when i enter

466
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680

 

467
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,910

his energy is still going through me

468
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
his energy is still going through me
 

469
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,310
his energy is still going through me
it's not me pushing him out of the way

470
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
it's not me pushing him out of the way
 

471

around here like this and she's gonna

480
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
around here like this and she's gonna
 

481
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,389
around here like this and she's gonna
push on me

482
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
push on me
 

483
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,509
push on me
okay if i brace and push this i think

484
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
okay if i brace and push this i think
 

485
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,070
okay if i brace and push this i think
you're let's see how strong you are holy

486
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
you're let's see how strong you are holy
 

487
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,949
you're let's see how strong you are holy
okay

488

okay
 

489
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,269
okay
uh you can stand up now

490
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
uh you can stand up now
 

491
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,670
uh you can stand up now
okay and he's gonna push and the only

492
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
okay and he's gonna push and the only
 

493
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,430
okay and he's gonna push and the only
way i can do this

494
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
way i can do this
 

495
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,750
way i can do this
is his energy is going through me you

496
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
is his energy is going through me you
 

497
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,030
is his energy is going through me you
can do two hands push okay he's gonna

498
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
can do two hands push okay he's gonna
 

499
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,389
can do two hands push okay he's gonna
push and i'm just gonna continually

500
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
push and i'm just gonna continually
 

501
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,269
push and i'm just gonna continually
uh let that energy go through me okay so

502
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
uh let that energy go through me okay so
 

503
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,150
uh let that energy go through me okay so
when i walk i don't start pushing it

504
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
when i walk i don't start pushing it
 

505
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,430
when i walk i don't start pushing it
it stays

506
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
it stays
 

507
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,550
it stays
through me and i just walk

508
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560

 

509
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,350

so if he comes around

510
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
so if he comes around
 

511
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,310
so if he comes around
and you can have so uh

512
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
and you can have so uh
 

513
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,069
and you can have so uh
we do the technique

514
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
we do the technique
 

515
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,150
we do the technique
right and he comes around

516
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
right and he comes around
 

517
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,590
right and he comes around
and again he's pushing holy sh

518
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
and again he's pushing holy sh
 

519
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,190
and again he's pushing holy sh
right away i'm gonna lose because

520
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
right away i'm gonna lose because
 

521
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,110
right away i'm gonna lose because
they're they're stronger than me as i

522
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
they're they're stronger than me as i
 

523
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,710
they're they're stronger than me as i
said if they were stronger than me i

524
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
said if they were stronger than me i
 

525
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,310
said if they were stronger than me i
can't do the technique

526
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
can't do the technique
 

527
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,389
can't do the technique
do you understand okay so he's he pushes

528
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
do you understand okay so he's he pushes
 

529
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,030
do you understand okay so he's he pushes
that energy is passing through me that

530
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
that energy is passing through me that
 

531
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,990
that energy is passing through me that
is why my knees are not

532
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
is why my knees are not
 

533
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,829
is why my knees are not
having their patella

534
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
having their patella
 

535
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,190
having their patella
shifted

536
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
shifted
 

537
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,030

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
okay and you can
 

557
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,630
okay and you can
come up

558
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
come up
 

559
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,310

you have to do

562
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
you have to do
 

563
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,269
you have to do
but i'm not saying it's easy to

564
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
but i'm not saying it's easy to
 

565
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,190
but i'm not saying it's easy to
understand it's easy to understand the

566
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
understand it's easy to understand the
 

567
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,670
understand it's easy to understand the
other two models because they speak to

568
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
other two models because they speak to
 

569
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,990
other two models because they speak to
our ego tripartite this does not speak

570
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
our ego tripartite this does not speak
 

571
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,910
our ego tripartite this does not speak
to our ego tripartite

572
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
to our ego tripartite
 

573
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,710
to our ego tripartite
but

574
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
but
 

575
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,430
but
if we say that's energy

576
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
if we say that's energy
 

577
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,509
if we say that's energy
it would be weird that energy would stop

578
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
it would be weird that energy would stop
 

579
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,030
it would be weird that energy would stop
at my skin

580
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
at my skin
 

581
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,670
at my skin
that is a stranger idea if you think

582
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
that is a stranger idea if you think
 

583
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,829
that is a stranger idea if you think
about it

584
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
about it
 

585
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,750
about it
okay energy passes through us all the

586
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
okay energy passes through us all the
 

587
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,630
okay energy passes through us all the
time

588
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
time
 

589
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,389
time
all right so

590
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
all right so
 

591
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,630
all right so
it would this happens too in ground

592
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
it would this happens too in ground
 

593
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,269

you know what
you don't brace on patella okay so

620
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
you don't brace on patella okay so
 

621
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,629
you don't brace on patella okay so
instead as he's moving i'm moving with

622
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
instead as he's moving i'm moving with
 

623
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,110
instead as he's moving i'm moving with
him that's how i'm doing these things

him that's how i'm doing these things
 

625
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,750
him that's how i'm doing these things
i'm moving with him i'm not gonna brace

626

i'm moving with him i'm not gonna brace
 

627
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,069
i'm moving with him i'm not gonna brace
and fight against him

628
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
and fight against him
 

629

it's very difficult
 

635
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,509
it's very difficult
if not impossible it is impossible to

636
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
if not impossible it is impossible to
 

637
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,069
if not impossible it is impossible to
not brace on the patella and then the

638
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
not brace on the patella and then the
 

639
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,990
not brace on the patella and then the
patella is gonna

640
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
patella is gonna
 

641
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,750
patella is gonna
do that it gets sore and it's gonna hurt

642
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
do that it gets sore and it's gonna hurt
 

643
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,870
do that it gets sore and it's gonna hurt
okay
