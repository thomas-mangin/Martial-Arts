1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,869

there's pieces you can add

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
there's pieces you can add
 

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,269
there's pieces you can add
if you offer him it here

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
if you offer him it here
 

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,670

you're doing the you're doing the wrong

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
you're doing the you're doing the wrong
 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,070
you're doing the you're doing the wrong
you're doing the wrong technique

8
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
you're doing the wrong technique
 

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,390
you're doing the wrong technique
because it's natural if it's coming like

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
because it's natural if it's coming like
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,470
because it's natural if it's coming like
that it's downwards isn't it it's

12
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
that it's downwards isn't it it's
 

13
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,830
that it's downwards isn't it it's
downwards if he's coming here

14
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
downwards if he's coming here
 

15
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,070
downwards if he's coming here
then you've got a chance to all right so

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
then you've got a chance to all right so
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,029
then you've got a chance to all right so
what

18
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
what
 

19
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,950
what
i found is

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
i found is
 

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,349
i found is
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit

22
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit
 

23
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,750
i'm so busy here that i get a little bit
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get

24
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get
 

25
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,069
stuck here it's a bit stuck now to get
this big lump through here

26
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
this big lump through here
 

27
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,870
this big lump through here
so

28
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
so
 

29
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,790
so
i'm not very elegant of that

30
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
i'm not very elegant of that
 

31
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,950
i'm not very elegant of that
so i need a little more space

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
so i need a little more space
 

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,910
so i need a little more space
so this is for the for the hakama

34
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
so this is for the for the hakama
 

35
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,750
so this is for the for the hakama
when he comes here i'm going to push him

36
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
when he comes here i'm going to push him
 

37
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,630
when he comes here i'm going to push him
to the stage without him knowing it

38
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640

 

39
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,430

to give me a bit more space

40
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
to give me a bit more space
 

41
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,549
to give me a bit more space
it

42
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
it
 

43
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,549
it
it's not so much pushing him as it's

44
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
it's not so much pushing him as it's
 

45
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,229
it's not so much pushing him as it's
holding him off

46
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
holding him off
 

47
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,590
