00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,340
a different mechanism so you have to
 

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,750
a different mechanism so you have to
stop using the old because that one's

77
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,410

blockage for my the percussion that I

78
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,420
blockage for my the percussion that I
 

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,890

103
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,020
there I'm going to lock everything and
I'm going to do a static operation of

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,030
I'm going to do a static operation of
 

105
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,630
I'm going to do a static operation of
the mechanics okay it's easier to do

106
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,640
the mechanics okay it's easier to do
 

107
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,560
the mechanics okay it's easier to do
static operations at the same account

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,570
static operations at the same account
 

109
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,570
static operations at the same account
but it is the same attendance we're just

110
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:03,580
but it is the same attendance we're just
 

111
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,490
but it is the same attendance we're just
not using it in terms of repercussions

112
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:05,500
not using it in terms of repercussions
 

113
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,460
not using it in terms of repercussions
so when I'm here like this I tighten all

114
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,470
so when I'm here like this I tighten all
 

115
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,400
so when I'm here like this I tighten all
that right it's tight and then I'm gonna

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,410
that right it's tight and then I'm gonna
 

117
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,530
that right it's tight and then I'm gonna
bow and when I bow I bow into his weight

118
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:16,540
bow and when I bow I bow into his weight
 

119
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,160
bow and when I bow I bow into his weight
so I don't follow me here and going to

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,170
so I don't follow me here and going to
 

121
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:31,860
so I don't follow me here and going to
bow into the heavy part

122
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:31,870

 

123
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,250

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,100
locked and I'm just going to bow in ten
 

141
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,830
locked and I'm just going to bow in ten
feet okay let's try that drill
