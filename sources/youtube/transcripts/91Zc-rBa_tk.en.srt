he's
this person he's not being attempted

238
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
this person he's not being attempted
 

239
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,790
this person he's not being attempted
anymore because he's

240
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
anymore because he's
 

241
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,350
anymore because he's
realized that

242
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360

so so what you're doing is you're doing
 

255
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,110
so so what you're doing is you're doing
everything correct believe it or not

256
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
everything correct believe it or not
 

257
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,270
everything correct believe it or not
he's doing everything correct but what's

258
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
he's doing everything correct but what's
 

259
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,230
he's doing everything correct but what's
happening is he's dropping his shoulder

260
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
happening is he's dropping his shoulder
 

261
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,950

he's going soft but now he's

262
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
he's going soft but now he's
 

263
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,670
he's going soft but now he's
he's decided to go in

264
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680

 

265
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,550

so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and

268
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and
 

269
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,430
so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and
using his strength

270
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
using his strength
 

271
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,390
using his strength
i've got to think

272
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400

 

273
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,590

are you still happy that you're

274
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
are you still happy that you're
 

275
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,950
are you still happy that you're
comfortable

276
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
comfortable
 

277
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,270
comfortable
and i didn't lock his mouth

278
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
and i didn't lock his mouth
 

279
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,710
and i didn't lock his mouth
so i'm going to just creep this leg

280
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
so i'm going to just creep this leg
 

281
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,670
so i'm going to just creep this leg
behind

282
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
behind
 

283
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,670
behind
and it's difficult

284
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
and it's difficult
 

285
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,350
and it's difficult
and i'll look this one bend that one's

286
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
and i'll look this one bend that one's
 

287
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,670
and i'll look this one bend that one's
straight so i'm gonna just slowly creep

288
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
straight so i'm gonna just slowly creep
 

289
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,390
straight so i'm gonna just slowly creep
up his body

290
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400

533
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:43,189

so he's

534
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199

 

535
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,949

hard to never know what other people are
 

539
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,150
hard to never know what other people are
thinking it looks like his arm still

540
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
thinking it looks like his arm still
 

541
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,150
thinking it looks like his arm still
working hard even though his body's got

542
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160

549
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,029

the next time you come if you come again

550
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039

 

551
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,789

556
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
him a centimeter i don't take it
 

557
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,350

you're giving far too much

558
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
you're giving far too much
 

559
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,309
you're giving far too much
by finding your own space

560
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
by finding your own space
 

561
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,630
by finding your own space
all right you've got to sort of work

562
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
all right you've got to sort of work
 

563
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,350
all right you've got to sort of work
within what you've got and you haven't

564
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
within what you've got and you haven't
 

565
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,829
within what you've got and you haven't
got a lot because he's holding him let's

566
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
got a lot because he's holding him let's
 

567
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,990
got a lot because he's holding him let's
try once more so this i'm talking to

568
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
try once more so this i'm talking to
 

569
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,230
try once more so this i'm talking to
everybody of course hopefully but so

570
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
everybody of course hopefully but so
 

571
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,190
everybody of course hopefully but so
he's got it in there but now by that

572
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
he's got it in there but now by that
 

573
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,430
he's got it in there but now by that
second move you actually give him too

574
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
second move you actually give him too
 

575
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,390
second move you actually give him too
much because you move and there wasn't

576
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
much because you move and there wasn't
 

577
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,470
much because you move and there wasn't
some kind of action

578
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
some kind of action
 

579
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,110
some kind of action
i mean it's as if like your puppet on a

580
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
i mean it's as if like your puppet on a
 

581
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,870
i mean it's as if like your puppet on a
string when they do that you got so even

582
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
string when they do that you got so even
 

583
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,630
string when they do that you got so even
when you go in

584
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
when you go in
 

585
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,110
when you go in
something's got to move that's connected

586
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
something's got to move that's connected
 

587
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,230
something's got to move that's connected
somewhere

588
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
somewhere
 

589
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,150
somewhere
if you just move in like that and

590
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
if you just move in like that and
 

591
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,070
if you just move in like that and
nothing happens and then you try and

592
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
nothing happens and then you try and
 

593
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,390
nothing happens and then you try and
make something happen there's a big

594
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
make something happen there's a big
 

595
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,310
make something happen there's a big
disjoint within the technique

596
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
disjoint within the technique
 

597
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,909
disjoint within the technique
but that's right well let's carry on

598
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
but that's right well let's carry on
 

599
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,470
but that's right well let's carry on
because you won't get it in a second so

600
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
because you won't get it in a second so
 

601
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,230
because you won't get it in a second so
it's not going to be showing it again

602
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
it's not going to be showing it again
 

603
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,470
it's not going to be showing it again
but this is the problem so i'm talking

604
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
but this is the problem so i'm talking
 

605
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,270
but this is the problem so i'm talking
to you all you're actually

606
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
to you all you're actually
 

607
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,029
to you all you're actually
trying to work out where to go yourself

608
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
trying to work out where to go yourself
 

609
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,470
trying to work out where to go yourself
you've forgotten that you've got a

610
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
you've forgotten that you've got a

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,990
partner
and the partners holding the road strong

614
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
and the partners holding the road strong
 

615
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,029
and the partners holding the road strong

connecting
 

627
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,350
connecting
but you've got to do it sneakily

628
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
but you've got to do it sneakily
 

629
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:51,110
but you've got to do it sneakily
okay

00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
out of the floor thinking
 

683
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,870
out of the floor thinking
wow

684
