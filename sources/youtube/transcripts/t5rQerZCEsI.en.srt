00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,580

I'm Christopher hi this week we're

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:16,590
I'm Christopher hi this week we're
 

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,470
I'm Christopher hi this week we're
talking about the importance of position

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
talking about the importance of position
 

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,689
talking about the importance of position
and how type position gives birth to

8
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:20,699
and how type position gives birth to
 

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,150
and how type position gives birth to
technique so one of the unfortunate

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
technique so one of the unfortunate
 

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,650
technique so one of the unfortunate
things about Aikido practices it's gone

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,660
things about Aikido practices it's gone
 

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,810
things about Aikido practices it's gone
on is we've become very technique

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:26,820
on is we've become very technique
 

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,970
on is we've become very technique
centric and by techniques I mean

16
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:28,980
centric and by techniques I mean
 

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,679
centric and by techniques I mean
actually the forms so we've gotten very

18
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:30,689
actually the forms so we've gotten very
 

19
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,500
actually the forms so we've gotten very
invested in the forms and and doing the

20
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,510
invested in the forms and and doing the
 

21
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,360
invested in the forms and and doing the
forms and we've begun to believe that

22
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,370
forms and we've begun to believe that
 

23
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,510
forms and we've begun to believe that
Aikido is the form so if we don't do the

24
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
Aikido is the form so if we don't do the
 

25
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,639
Aikido is the form so if we don't do the
forms then we're not doing Aikido but

26
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:40,649
forms then we're not doing Aikido but
 

27
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,920
forms then we're not doing Aikido but
that's clearly not true and it's true

28
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:42,930
that's clearly not true and it's true
 

29
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,080
that's clearly not true and it's true
from the founders perspective as well he

30
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,090
from the founders perspective as well he
 

31
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,520
from the founders perspective as well he
gave lectures saying that the techniques

32
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,530
gave lectures saying that the techniques
 

33
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,650
gave lectures saying that the techniques
aren't Aikido and that in fact Aikido

34
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:48,660
aren't Aikido and that in fact Aikido
 

35
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,029
aren't Aikido and that in fact Aikido
its highest level should be the

36
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
its highest level should be the
 

37
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,400
its highest level should be the
spontaneous eruption of techniques so so

38
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,410
spontaneous eruption of techniques so so
 

39
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,069
spontaneous eruption of techniques so so
doing a form does not mean doing Aikido

40
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
doing a form does not mean doing Aikido
 

41
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,069
doing a form does not mean doing Aikido
and so you know if you do Kota gosh that

42
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
and so you know if you do Kota gosh that
 

43
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,049
and so you know if you do Kota gosh that
doesn't mean you're doing the system of

44
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,059
doesn't mean you're doing the system of
 

45
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,580
doesn't mean you're doing the system of
Aikido I feel as a systematic approach

46
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,590
Aikido I feel as a systematic approach
 

47
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,319
Aikido I feel as a systematic approach
to conflict and that systematic

48
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:03,329
to conflict and that systematic
 

49
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,050
to conflict and that systematic
approaches independent of the forms

50
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,060
approaches independent of the forms
 

51
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,330
approaches independent of the forms
themselves now one of the big problems

52
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:08,340
themselves now one of the big problems
 

53
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,429
themselves now one of the big problems
with thinking that the forms are Aikido

54
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,439
with thinking that the forms are Aikido
 

55
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,039
with thinking that the forms are Aikido
is that thinking in order to do Aikido

56
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,049
is that thinking in order to do Aikido
 

57
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,140
is that thinking in order to do Aikido
to use your Aikido you need to get in

58
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,150
to use your Aikido you need to get in
 

59
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,850
to use your Aikido you need to get in
over to a position so you can do a

60
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
over to a position so you can do a
 

61
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,950
over to a position so you can do a
technique and so you begin to think that

62
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
technique and so you begin to think that
 

63
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,890
technique and so you begin to think that
the positions are the the children of

64
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
the positions are the the children of
 

65
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,359
the positions are the the children of
the the techniques of the technique of

66
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,369
the the techniques of the technique of
 

67
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,370
the the techniques of the technique of
the form so meaning I want to do this

68
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
the form so meaning I want to do this
 

69
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,109
the form so meaning I want to do this
form so that's when I go to this

70
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
form so that's when I go to this
 

71
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,740
form so that's when I go to this
position

72
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:27,750
position
 

73
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,630
position
but actually it's reversed and

74
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640
but actually it's reversed and
 

75
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,280
but actually it's reversed and
understanding this reverse will do a lot

76
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,290
understanding this reverse will do a lot
 

77
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,170
understanding this reverse will do a lot
to improve your Aikido you need to

78
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,180
to improve your Aikido you need to
 

79
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,940
to improve your Aikido you need to
understand that the position is more

80
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:34,950
understand that the position is more
 

81
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,520
understand that the position is more
important than whatever comes off of the

82
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,530
important than whatever comes off of the
 

83
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,950
important than whatever comes off of the
position so the position is a tactic

84
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:39,960
position so the position is a tactic
 

85
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,630
position so the position is a tactic
it's higher up in the in the strategic

86
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
it's higher up in the in the strategic
 

87
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,880
it's higher up in the in the strategic
order of what we do then the technique

88
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:43,890
order of what we do then the technique
 

89
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,859
order of what we do then the technique
is itself so the technique helps us

90
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:45,869
is itself so the technique helps us
 

91
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,389
is itself so the technique helps us
facilitate the tactic which is this

92
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
facilitate the tactic which is this
 

93
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,359
facilitate the tactic which is this
position we've taken so this video is

94
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,369
position we've taken so this video is
 

95
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,740
position we've taken so this video is
going to be in and we're gonna do a few

96
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
going to be in and we're gonna do a few
 

97
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,510
going to be in and we're gonna do a few
here this week this video is going to be

98
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
here this week this video is going to be
 

99
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,480
here this week this video is going to be
about how the the position is more

100
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,490
about how the the position is more
 

101
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,950
about how the the position is more
important than the technique that we do

102
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
important than the technique that we do
 

103
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,569
important than the technique that we do
from it and how all the forms really

104
00:01:59,569 --> 00:01:59,579
from it and how all the forms really
 

105
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,429
from it and how all the forms really
come because of positions that we find

106
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
come because of positions that we find
 

107
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,870
come because of positions that we find
ourselves in and not the other way

108
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
ourselves in and not the other way
 

109
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,260
ourselves in and not the other way
around

110
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,270
around
 

111
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,639
around
so I'm gonna get Josh out here and we're

112
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:04,649
so I'm gonna get Josh out here and we're
 

113
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,749
so I'm gonna get Josh out here and we're
gonna go through some of this stuff with

114
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
gonna go through some of this stuff with
 

115
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,210
gonna go through some of this stuff with
you Josh

116
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,220
you Josh
 

117
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,230
you Josh
all right so we're talking about

118
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,240
all right so we're talking about
 

119
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,720
all right so we're talking about
position in Aikido the first position we

120
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:12,730
position in Aikido the first position we
 

121
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,370
position in Aikido the first position we
have to understand in Aikido is the Hana

122
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380
have to understand in Aikido is the Hana
 

123
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,870
have to understand in Aikido is the Hana
me position now understand the Hana me

124
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:15,880
me position now understand the Hana me
 

125
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,240
me position now understand the Hana me
position will naturally arise is my

126
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,250
position will naturally arise is my
 

127
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,100
position will naturally arise is my
desire to take care of myself

128
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,110
desire to take care of myself
 

129
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,870
desire to take care of myself
happen so I'm not getting into a hungry

130
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:21,880
happen so I'm not getting into a hungry
 

131
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,400
happen so I'm not getting into a hungry
position so that way I can do a

132
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,410
position so that way I can do a
 

133
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,630
position so that way I can do a
technique I don't want to do it taking

134
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
technique I don't want to do it taking
 

135
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,250
technique I don't want to do it taking
this guy cared less about that I just

136
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,260
this guy cared less about that I just
 

137
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,930
this guy cared less about that I just
don't want this guy doing anything to me

138
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:27,940
don't want this guy doing anything to me
 

139
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,760
don't want this guy doing anything to me
now force here in this position it's

140
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:29,770
now force here in this position it's
 

141
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,110
now force here in this position it's
called move Hana me in our school it

142
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
called move Hana me in our school it
 

143
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,630
called move Hana me in our school it
means without fun me so what's bad about

144
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,640
means without fun me so what's bad about
 

145
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
means without fun me so what's bad about
this position is if Josh and I were

146
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:35,650
this position is if Josh and I were
 

147
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,960
this position is if Josh and I were
trying to find out who the toughest guy

148
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:36,970
trying to find out who the toughest guy
 

149
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,759
trying to find out who the toughest guy
was right we're squared up to find that

150
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:38,769
was right we're squared up to find that
 

151
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,920
was right we're squared up to find that
out so meaning if I hit Josh I hit him

152
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:40,930
out so meaning if I hit Josh I hit him
 

153
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,809
out so meaning if I hit Josh I hit him
full force Josh hits me hits me full

154
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:42,819
full force Josh hits me hits me full
 

155
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,460
full force Josh hits me hits me full
force right until we trade it until we

156
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,470
force right until we trade it until we
 

157
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,410
force right until we trade it until we
find out who's tougher and I care it's a

158
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,420
find out who's tougher and I care it's a
 

159
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,000
find out who's tougher and I care it's a
foregone conclusion this guy's tougher

160
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,010
foregone conclusion this guy's tougher
 

161
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,680
foregone conclusion this guy's tougher
than me I know he's tougher he's faster

162
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,690
than me I know he's tougher he's faster
 

163
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,850
than me I know he's tougher he's faster
and that's why I need to use Aikido

164
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:50,860
and that's why I need to use Aikido
 

165
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,440
and that's why I need to use Aikido
stuff because he's a bigger stronger

166
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,450
stuff because he's a bigger stronger
 

167
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,270
stuff because he's a bigger stronger
beast than me so I need to be able to

168
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
beast than me so I need to be able to
 

169
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,990
beast than me so I need to be able to
take care of myself

170
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,000
take care of myself
 

171
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,610
take care of myself
so the first thing I want to do is to

172
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:56,620
so the first thing I want to do is to
 

173
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,039
so the first thing I want to do is to
bury my position okay so meaning I want

174
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,049
bury my position okay so meaning I want
 

175
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,690
bury my position okay so meaning I want
to get off to a slight angle now the

176
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:00,700
to get off to a slight angle now the
 

177
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,820
to get off to a slight angle now the
reason is because josh still is making

178
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:02,830
reason is because josh still is making
 

179
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,830
reason is because josh still is making
power most powerfully this way right so

180
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:04,840
power most powerfully this way right so
 

181
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,140
power most powerfully this way right so
he's best at making power here I'm not

182
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,150
he's best at making power here I'm not
 

183
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,860
he's best at making power here I'm not
there anymore

184
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,870
there anymore
 

185
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,229
there anymore
but Josh still is in my power zone so

186
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
but Josh still is in my power zone so
 

187
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,970
but Josh still is in my power zone so
because they came off here now I have a

188
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:11,980
because they came off here now I have a
 

189
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,949
because they came off here now I have a
slight power advantage Tim he's not

190
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:13,959
slight power advantage Tim he's not
 

191
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,479
slight power advantage Tim he's not
gonna stay there all day so understand

192
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,489
gonna stay there all day so understand
 

193
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,069
gonna stay there all day so understand
this is always going to be dynamic I'm

194
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:17,079
this is always going to be dynamic I'm
 

195
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,449
this is always going to be dynamic I'm
gonna move he's gonna move I'm gonna

196
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:18,459
gonna move he's gonna move I'm gonna
 

197
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,099
gonna move he's gonna move I'm gonna
move he's gonna move what the techniques

198
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,109
move he's gonna move what the techniques
 

199
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:23,190
move he's gonna move what the techniques
do is they help me maintain my positions

200
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
do is they help me maintain my positions
 

201
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,770
do is they help me maintain my positions
that's what they do as he tries to get

202
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:25,780
that's what they do as he tries to get
 

203
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,539
that's what they do as he tries to get
the new position then the techniques

204
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:27,549
the new position then the techniques
 

205
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,370
the new position then the techniques
help me keep that position that I have

206
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,380
help me keep that position that I have
 

207
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,949
help me keep that position that I have
so they're maintaining the position if I

208
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:31,959
so they're maintaining the position if I
 

209
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,530
so they're maintaining the position if I
come off to the side like this this puts

210
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,540
come off to the side like this this puts
 

211
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,690
come off to the side like this this puts
us in yaku upon me now that might be

212
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:36,700
us in yaku upon me now that might be
 

213
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,310
us in yaku upon me now that might be
really hard for you to see if I have

214
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,320
really hard for you to see if I have
 

215
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,630
really hard for you to see if I have
Josh lined up in a perfect calling me

216
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:39,640
Josh lined up in a perfect calling me
 

217
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,099
Josh lined up in a perfect calling me
and I'll end up in perfect on me now you

218
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:41,109
and I'll end up in perfect on me now you
 

219
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:42,840
and I'll end up in perfect on me now you
can see this is classic Aikido how we

220
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:42,850
can see this is classic Aikido how we
 

221
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,400
can see this is classic Aikido how we
practice right so real easy for

222
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,410
practice right so real easy for
 

223
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,259
practice right so real easy for
beginners to see what this position is

224
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:46,269
beginners to see what this position is
 

225
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,120
beginners to see what this position is
but that really just comes from moving

226
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,130
but that really just comes from moving
 

227
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,430
but that really just comes from moving
from a-squared position off to the side

228
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,440
from a-squared position off to the side
 

229
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,500
from a-squared position off to the side
right so Josh was running at me square

230
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,510
right so Josh was running at me square
 

231
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,120
right so Josh was running at me square
and I came off to the side like this

232
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,130
and I came off to the side like this
 

233
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,190
and I came off to the side like this
then that didn't what I'm doing here is

234
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,200
then that didn't what I'm doing here is
 

235
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,680
then that didn't what I'm doing here is
I'm coming off to that that yaku hanmi

236
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,690
I'm coming off to that that yaku hanmi
 

237
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,150
I'm coming off to that that yaku hanmi
position right so I'm gonna gaff cool on

238
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,160
position right so I'm gonna gaff cool on
 

239
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,940
position right so I'm gonna gaff cool on
me now if I stepped off this way this

240
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:02,950
me now if I stepped off this way this
 

241
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,890
me now if I stepped off this way this
puts us in I on me again it might be

242
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:04,900
puts us in I on me again it might be
 

243
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,360
puts us in I on me again it might be
hard to see but if Josh goes into a real

244
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,370
hard to see but if Josh goes into a real
 

245
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,340
hard to see but if Josh goes into a real
clear hanmi you can see we're in i Hani

246
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,350
clear hanmi you can see we're in i Hani
 

247
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,420
clear hanmi you can see we're in i Hani
stance and that just comes from me

248
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:09,430
stance and that just comes from me
 

249
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,059
stance and that just comes from me
stepping that way so when we're here I'm

250
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:12,069
stepping that way so when we're here I'm
 

251
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,270
stepping that way so when we're here I'm
gonna step over to the side in one of

252
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
gonna step over to the side in one of
 

253
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,400
gonna step over to the side in one of
two ways one of those ways is going to

254
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,410
two ways one of those ways is going to
 

255
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,920
two ways one of those ways is going to
lead me to Yahoo hanmi the other way is

256
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:18,930
lead me to Yahoo hanmi the other way is
 

257
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,780
lead me to Yahoo hanmi the other way is
gonna lead me to I've hugged me now

258
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:20,790
gonna lead me to I've hugged me now
 

259
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,790
gonna lead me to I've hugged me now
understand the second I do that Josh is

260
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
understand the second I do that Josh is
 

261
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,710
understand the second I do that Josh is
dynamically going to be trying to change

262
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
dynamically going to be trying to change
 

263
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,110
dynamically going to be trying to change
his position to improve it for him so

264
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
his position to improve it for him so
 

265
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,180
his position to improve it for him so
what happens there right so let's say I

266
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
what happens there right so let's say I
 

267
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,300
what happens there right so let's say I
move off into an eye on me like this so

268
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,310
move off into an eye on me like this so
 

269
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,490
move off into an eye on me like this so
I'm moving back here Josh is probably

270
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm moving back here Josh is probably
 

271
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm moving back here Josh is probably
going to start coming to my back side so

272
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,120
going to start coming to my back side so
 

273
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,490
going to start coming to my back side so
like this is pressing into that back

274
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,500
like this is pressing into that back
 

275
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,290
like this is pressing into that back
side now he has the eating me position

276
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,300
side now he has the eating me position
 

277
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,730
side now he has the eating me position
at the strong position for him so that's

278
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:40,740
at the strong position for him so that's
 

279
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,470
at the strong position for him so that's
what he wants meanwhile I would be

280
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,480
what he wants meanwhile I would be
 

281
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,060
what he wants meanwhile I would be
trying to press eating me on him so as

282
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,070
trying to press eating me on him so as
 

283
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,680
trying to press eating me on him so as
he's coming to my back I'm trying to

284
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:45,690
he's coming to my back I'm trying to
 

285
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,090
he's coming to my back I'm trying to
come to his back so we're always working

286
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,100
come to his back so we're always working
 

287
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,680
come to his back so we're always working
this back and forth back and forth back

288
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,690
this back and forth back and forth back
 

289
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,990
this back and forth back and forth back
and forth now how might that play out

290
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
and forth now how might that play out
 

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,450
and forth now how might that play out
really quickly well if we're moving

292
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:53,460
really quickly well if we're moving
 

293
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,770
really quickly well if we're moving
around so understand this is never gonna

294
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:54,780
around so understand this is never gonna
 

295
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,540
around so understand this is never gonna
be static you know Josh we're not gonna

296
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:56,550
be static you know Josh we're not gonna
 

297
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,060
be static you know Josh we're not gonna
meet like this on a field and then we're

298
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,070
meet like this on a field and then we're
 

299
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,440
meet like this on a field and then we're
gonna do some stuff that's not what

300
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,450
gonna do some stuff that's not what
 

301
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,450

we're gonna do right this guy's coming
 

303
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,950
we're gonna do right this guy's coming
at me and I'm coming off to the side

304
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:03,960
at me and I'm coming off to the side
 

305
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
at me and I'm coming off to the side
like this or I'm trying to get out of

306
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,250
like this or I'm trying to get out of
 

307
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,710
like this or I'm trying to get out of
there and he's improving his position

308
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
there and he's improving his position
 

309
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,270
there and he's improving his position
now while that's happening in the

310
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,280
now while that's happening in the
 

311
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,740
now while that's happening in the
technique I'll show right now is showman

312
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:09,750
technique I'll show right now is showman
 

313
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,760
technique I'll show right now is showman
just it's really easy to go through

314
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:10,770
just it's really easy to go through
 

315
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,890
just it's really easy to go through
these as he's doing that I'm probably

316
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:12,900
these as he's doing that I'm probably
 

317
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,600
these as he's doing that I'm probably
gonna hit him so he's coming in and move

showman gyaku yokomen position like that

330
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:23,760
showman gyaku yokomen position like that
 

331
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,850
showman gyaku yokomen position like that
if he brings his hands up to protect

332
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:25,860
if he brings his hands up to protect
 

333
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,740
if he brings his hands up to protect
himself which is perfectly natural bang

334
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:27,750
himself which is perfectly natural bang
 

335
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,360

we're gonna be here in this position

336
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,370
we're gonna be here in this position
 

337
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,430
we're gonna be here in this position
which is the shomenuchi position right

338
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
which is the shomenuchi position right
 

339
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,500
which is the shomenuchi position right
so now we have shomenuchi that's what we

340
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:33,510
so now we have shomenuchi that's what we
 

341
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,820
so now we have shomenuchi that's what we
have here so this is a classic position
