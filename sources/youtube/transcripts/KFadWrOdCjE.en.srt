1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,750

we've done the five thrusting movements

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
we've done the five thrusting movements
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,669
we've done the five thrusting movements
now and uh started on the

4
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679

 

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,589

the strikes so the strikes are

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
the strikes so the strikes are
 

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,029
the strikes so the strikes are
quite simply just because you're using a

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
quite simply just because you're using a
 

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,510
quite simply just because you're using a
joe

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
joe
 

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,630
joe
it should be the same as using a ken

12
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640

 

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,109

so xiaomi komi was the first one

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
so xiaomi komi was the first one
 

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:54,630
so xiaomi komi was the first one
or number five

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640

 

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,869

so if you do you can do the ken first of

18
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
so if you do you can do the ken first of
 

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,990
so if you do you can do the ken first of
all then you

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
all then you
 

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,069
all then you
can do this one if you've got

22
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
can do this one if you've got
 

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,390
can do this one if you've got
the chance to use the terra nucci the

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
the chance to use the terra nucci the
 

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,390
the chance to use the terra nucci the
tyre or bundle of sticks

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
tyre or bundle of sticks
 

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,149
tyre or bundle of sticks
you need something that gives you a

28
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
you need something that gives you a
 

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,350
you need something that gives you a
bounce and with the taranuchi we

30
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
bounce and with the taranuchi we
 

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,270
bounce and with the taranuchi we
we hold our hands at the end of the can

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
we hold our hands at the end of the can
 

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,429
we hold our hands at the end of the can
normally and it's a larger can it's a

34
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
normally and it's a larger can it's a
 

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,070
normally and it's a larger can it's a
suburuto

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
suburuto
 

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,510
suburuto
and the idea is you hit the tire or the

38
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
and the idea is you hit the tire or the
 

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,310
and the idea is you hit the tire or the
sticks

40
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
sticks
 

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,230
sticks
and you get bounce and you have to stop

42
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
and you get bounce and you have to stop
 

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,510
and you get bounce and you have to stop
the bounce

44
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
the bounce
 

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,109
the bounce
so it hits the tar and you and you stop

46
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
so it hits the tar and you and you stop
 

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,990
so it hits the tar and you and you stop
the bounce

48
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
the bounce
 

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,550
the bounce
about five centimeters seven centimeters

50
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
about five centimeters seven centimeters
 

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,670
about five centimeters seven centimeters
above the tar

52
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
above the tar
 

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,670
above the tar
so you actually stop the bounce you

54
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
so you actually stop the bounce you
 

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,749
so you actually stop the bounce you
don't stop hit the tar and

56
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
don't stop hit the tar and
 

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,230
don't stop hit the tar and
let it bounce like this or you don't hit

58
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
let it bounce like this or you don't hit
 

59
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,190
let it bounce like this or you don't hit
the tar

60
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
the tar
 

61
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,990
the tar
and keep on the tar you hit the tar and

62
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
and keep on the tar you hit the tar and
 

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,310
and keep on the tar you hit the tar and
you

64
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
you
 

65
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,950
you
use the bounce okay so this is quite

66
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
use the bounce okay so this is quite
 

67
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,749
use the bounce okay so this is quite
important for the next one

68
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
important for the next one
 

69
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,830
important for the next one
when zakuchikomi what's a double cut

70
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
when zakuchikomi what's a double cut
 

71
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,270
when zakuchikomi what's a double cut
you need to learn how to receive

72
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
you need to learn how to receive
 

73
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,149
you need to learn how to receive
from the attacker receive use their

74
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
from the attacker receive use their
 

75
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,630
from the attacker receive use their
power

76
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
power
 

77
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,229
power
so with the taranuchi you you use the

78
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
so with the taranuchi you you use the
 

79
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,830
so with the taranuchi you you use the
power of the bounce

80
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
power of the bounce
 

81
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,990
power of the bounce
and when it bounces you learn to stop it

82
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
and when it bounces you learn to stop it
 

83
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,790
and when it bounces you learn to stop it
and this develops the stomach muscles

84
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
and this develops the stomach muscles
 

85
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,229
and this develops the stomach muscles
and the coq your breath and you stop it

86
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
and the coq your breath and you stop it
 

87
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,270
and the coq your breath and you stop it
i hate

88
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
i hate
 

89
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,150
i hate
and you do it by pressing a small like a

90
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
and you do it by pressing a small like a
 

91
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,550
and you do it by pressing a small like a
knot

92
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
knot
 

93
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,190
knot
in your stomach it's not a tense not

94
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
in your stomach it's not a tense not
 

95
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,470
in your stomach it's not a tense not
it's just a

96
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
it's just a
 

97
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,830
it's just a
quick key eye

98
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
quick key eye
 

99
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,949
quick key eye
pressure in the stomach hey

100
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
pressure in the stomach hey
 

101
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,589
pressure in the stomach hey
so the bounce it the part i'm talking

102
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
so the bounce it the part i'm talking
 

103
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,589
so the bounce it the part i'm talking
about is it's important about the bounce

104
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
about is it's important about the bounce
 

105
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,630
about is it's important about the bounce
so we've done the

106
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640

 

107
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,750

uchikomi and now the renzoku economy

108
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
uchikomi and now the renzoku economy
 

109
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,830
uchikomi and now the renzoku economy
the same thing we strike

110
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
the same thing we strike
 

111
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,869
the same thing we strike
and the bounce this little bounce

112
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
and the bounce this little bounce
 

113
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,830
and the bounce this little bounce
we use to do the second

114
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

115
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,470

cut

116
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480

 

117
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,149

okay so i'm going to use that bounce if

118
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
okay so i'm going to use that bounce if
 

119
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,070
okay so i'm going to use that bounce if
if i don't use the bounce it becomes

120
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
if i don't use the bounce it becomes
 

121
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,270
if i don't use the bounce it becomes
mechanical

122
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
mechanical
 

123
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,430
mechanical
and i'm doing all the work and this is

124
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
and i'm doing all the work and this is
 

125
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,750
and i'm doing all the work and this is
not our sense as i could own

126
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
not our sense as i could own
 

127
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,470
not our sense as i could own
we shouldn't be using physical strength

128
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
we shouldn't be using physical strength
 

129
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,309
we shouldn't be using physical strength
we should be using the flow

130
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
we should be using the flow
 

131
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,949
we should be using the flow
the natural flow of what we're given and

132
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
the natural flow of what we're given and
 

133
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:40,949
the natural flow of what we're given and
we're given the bounds

134
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959

 

135
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:55,429

i'll try and do it slowly

136
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439

 

137
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:17,189

please watch the feed this time

138
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199

 

139
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,550

so timing is everything the passes

140
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
so timing is everything the passes
 

141
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,670
so timing is everything the passes
and minuses it's the pros and cons as

142
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
and minuses it's the pros and cons as
 

143
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:33,350
and minuses it's the pros and cons as
with the other things

144
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360

 

145
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,950

so this may happen

146
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960

 

147
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,550

you want to push out with your left hand

148
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
you want to push out with your left hand
 

149
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:53,189
you want to push out with your left hand
in a

150
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199

 

151
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,390

the other hand is like a pivot

152
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
the other hand is like a pivot
 

153
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,110
the other hand is like a pivot
if there's a pin through here it'd be

154
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
if there's a pin through here it'd be
 

155
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,629
if there's a pin through here it'd be
like a pivot

156
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639

 

157
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,670

so this hand is really quite loose it's

158
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
so this hand is really quite loose it's
 

159
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,430
so this hand is really quite loose it's
allowing the joe

160
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
allowing the joe
 

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,150
allowing the joe
and it's just following just following

162
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
and it's just following just following
 

163
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,830
and it's just following just following
the joke

164
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
the joke
 

165
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,510
the joke
it's not lifting the joke so

166
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
it's not lifting the joke so
 

167
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,590
it's not lifting the joke so
the fault here is some people start to

168
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
the fault here is some people start to
 

169
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,029
the fault here is some people start to
do this and then they start to lift

170
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
do this and then they start to lift
 

171
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,749
do this and then they start to lift
with the right hand this is a this is

172
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
with the right hand this is a this is
 

173
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,350
with the right hand this is a this is

strike you do it slowly you have to put
 

197
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,510
strike you do it slowly you have to put
the bounce in

198
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
the bounce in
 

199
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,749
the bounce in
don't wind up the body this is another

00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
don't wind up the body this is another
 

201
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,629
don't wind up the body this is another
fault

202
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
fault
 

203
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,749
fault
a lot of people they wind up the body to

204
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
a lot of people they wind up the body to
 

205
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,110
a lot of people they wind up the body to
get this second strike

206
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
get this second strike
 

207
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,670
get this second strike
to have power you don't want to wind up

208
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
to have power you don't want to wind up
 

209
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:33,430
to have power you don't want to wind up
the body

210
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440

 

211
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:42,870

another fault that comes up

212
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880

 

213
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,990

drop the tip now that

214
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
drop the tip now that
 

215
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,070
drop the tip now that
there's a moment where it might sag and

216
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
there's a moment where it might sag and
 

217
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,909
there's a moment where it might sag and
you have to mechanically lift it up

218
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
you have to mechanically lift it up
 

219
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,870
you have to mechanically lift it up
you need the timing to drop the tip and

220
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
you need the timing to drop the tip and
 

221
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,469
you need the timing to drop the tip and
lift at the same time

222
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
lift at the same time
 

223
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,350
lift at the same time
so that the dropping gives the top

224
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
so that the dropping gives the top
 

225
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,670
so that the dropping gives the top
momentum

226
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
momentum
 

227
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,430
momentum
so it's like

228
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440

 

229
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,430

then you need the timing to get that

230
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
then you need the timing to get that
 

231
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,469
then you need the timing to get that
front foot

232
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
front foot
 

233
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,830
front foot
in time with that spiraling

234
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

235
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:33,190

cut

236
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,200

238
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319

 

239
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,430

not this

240
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
not this
 

241
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,990
not this
not this winding up of the body

242
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000

 

243
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,950

the the turning of the foot is very

244
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
the the turning of the foot is very
 

245
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,710
the the turning of the foot is very
important with the turning

246
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720

 

247
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,230

about here about here
that last quarter

250
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
that last quarter
 

251
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,589
that last quarter
is when the foot engages with the timing

252
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
is when the foot engages with the timing
 

253
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:26,230
is when the foot engages with the timing
of the joe

hypogeary striking with the joe you need
 

261
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,149
hypogeary striking with the joe you need
to understand about the timing of the
