1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,510

okay uh so we did the the um ASI

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,520
okay uh so we did the the um ASI
 

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,350
okay uh so we did the the um ASI
saaki and then we did the Tachi to give

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
saaki and then we did the Tachi to give
 

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,589
saaki and then we did the Tachi to give
us the edmi

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
us the edmi
 

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,070
us the edmi
angle and and I talked about how there

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,080
angle and and I talked about how there
 

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,230
angle and and I talked about how there
is a the ability to internalize the Yang

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
is a the ability to internalize the Yang
 

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,669
is a the ability to internalize the Yang
aspect necessary for myi okay so we're

12
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:26,679
aspect necessary for myi okay so we're
 

13
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,990
aspect necessary for myi okay so we're
going to take that part off and let's

14
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,000
going to take that part off and let's
 

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,950
going to take that part off and let's
just look at

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
just look at
 

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,310
just look at
uh the kazushi of the x pattern it is

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
uh the kazushi of the x pattern it is
 

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
uh the kazushi of the x pattern it is
quite quite different from everything

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:37,960
quite quite different from everything
 

21
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,150
quite quite different from everything
I've seen out there okay um and you have

22
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
I've seen out there okay um and you have
 

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,869
I've seen out there okay um and you have
to be careful if you're trying to do my

24
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
to be careful if you're trying to do my
 

25
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,470
to be careful if you're trying to do my
way because the other way is an anti-

26
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,480
way because the other way is an anti-
 

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,670
way because the other way is an anti-
way it's not a variant it's not an

28
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
way it's not a variant it's not an
 

29
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,869
way it's not a variant it's not an
alternative it's it does not function

30
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:55,879
alternative it's it does not function
 

31
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,590
alternative it's it does not function
okay so a couple things um um we have to

32
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
okay so a couple things um um we have to
 

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,550
okay so a couple things um um we have to
continue working with that Yin Yong grid

34
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:05,560
continue working with that Yin Yong grid
 

35
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,990
continue working with that Yin Yong grid
okay so as we brought from the atmi on

36
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
okay so as we brought from the atmi on
 

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,510
okay so as we brought from the atmi on
the wui we brought the wrist to that

38
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520
the wui we brought the wrist to that
 

39
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,190
the wui we brought the wrist to that
where that hand can now take over this

40
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,200
where that hand can now take over this
 

41
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,950
where that hand can now take over this
hand will move to the Y Line so that the

42
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:23,960
hand will move to the Y Line so that the
 

43
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,550
hand will move to the Y Line so that the
elbow can now go to the wui line you

44
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
elbow can now go to the wui line you
 

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,350
elbow can now go to the wui line you
don't want to keep the wrist wrist there

46
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
don't want to keep the wrist wrist there
 

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,510
don't want to keep the wrist wrist there
on the center line and the elbow on the

48
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:34,520
on the center line and the elbow on the
 

49
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,270
on the center line and the elbow on the
Yang line that does not work because

50
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
Yang line that does not work because
 

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,550
Yang line that does not work because
what we're doing is going from body

52
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,560
what we're doing is going from body
 

53
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,510
what we're doing is going from body
control to an arm isolation that begins

54
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
control to an arm isolation that begins
 

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,910
control to an arm isolation that begins
at the wrist and then gets coupled with

56
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:50,920
at the wrist and then gets coupled with
 

57
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,550
at the wrist and then gets coupled with
the elbow that is the Tactical

58
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
the elbow that is the Tactical
 

59
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,270
the elbow that is the Tactical
sequence um because that's always the

60
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,280
sequence um because that's always the
 

61
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,350
sequence um because that's always the
Tactical sequence for arm isolations

62
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
Tactical sequence for arm isolations
 

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,590
Tactical sequence for arm isolations
attack the body the arm will become

64
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
attack the body the arm will become
 

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,990
attack the body the arm will become
isolatable work from the wrist to

66
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,000
isolatable work from the wrist to
 

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,109
isolatable work from the wrist to
control the elbow and the wrist that's

68
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,119
control the elbow and the wrist that's
 

69
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,229
control the elbow and the wrist that's
that's how you do it whether it's a

70
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
that's how you do it whether it's a
 

71
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,949
that's how you do it whether it's a
knife disarm or an arresting method or a

72
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
knife disarm or an arresting method or a
 

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,030
knife disarm or an arresting method or a
Nea technique that's how you do it

74
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,040
Nea technique that's how you do it
 

75
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,030
Nea technique that's how you do it
okay um

76
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040

 

77
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,309

so

78
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:27,319
so
 

79
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,110
so
when we move him you see I go to the to

80
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,120
when we move him you see I go to the to
 

81
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,630
when we move him you see I go to the to
the wrist so you attack the body in the

82
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640
the wrist so you attack the body in the
 

83
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,750
the wrist so you attack the body in the
kazushi that exposes the arm it's

84
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:38,760
kazushi that exposes the arm it's
 

85
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,309
kazushi that exposes the arm it's
isolated now from his Center Line that's

86
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:41,319
isolated now from his Center Line that's
 

87
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,509
isolated now from his Center Line that's
what you're doing from his Mass you go

88
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,519
what you're doing from his Mass you go
 

89
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,229
what you're doing from his Mass you go
to the wrist then you get the the elbow

90
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
to the wrist then you get the the elbow
 

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,390
to the wrist then you get the the elbow
and now you have Arm Control once you

92
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
and now you have Arm Control once you
 

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,750
and now you have Arm Control once you
have wrist and elbow okay but the next

94
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,760
have wrist and elbow okay but the next
 

95
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,350
have wrist and elbow okay but the next
thing is all pins always have to go

96
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,360
thing is all pins always have to go
 

97
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,070
thing is all pins always have to go
underneath you they don't go go out out

98
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,080
underneath you they don't go go out out
 

99
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,869
underneath you they don't go go out out
away from you they have to go underneath

100
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:03,879
away from you they have to go underneath
 

101
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,670
away from you they have to go underneath
you and that means they have to go in

102
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:06,680
you and that means they have to go in
 

103
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,030
you and that means they have to go in
towards you so down and in is the PIN

104
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,040
towards you so down and in is the PIN
 

105
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,990
towards you so down and in is the PIN
not up and out there's no pin up and out

106
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,000
not up and out there's no pin up and out
 

107
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,149
not up and out there's no pin up and out
throws are up and out pins are in and

108
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
throws are up and out pins are in and
 

109
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,229
throws are up and out pins are in and
down um

110
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
down um
 

111
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,990
down um
so if I take his energy like on a lot of

112
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
so if I take his energy like on a lot of
 

113
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,589
so if I take his energy like on a lot of
uh ferite iido they move him away like

114
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
uh ferite iido they move him away like
 

115
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,190
uh ferite iido they move him away like
that do you see and this is not control

116
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
that do you see and this is not control
 

117
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,309
that do you see and this is not control
I don't have control over this limb he

118
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:35,319
I don't have control over this limb he
 

119
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,949
I don't have control over this limb he
can get

120
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:37,959

 

121
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,630

up

122
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:39,640
up
 

123
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,390
up
um so let's look at why like anyone who

124
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
um so let's look at why like anyone who
 

125
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,589
um so let's look at why like anyone who
fights or tries to arrest people knows

126
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:46,599
fights or tries to arrest people knows
 

127
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,910
fights or tries to arrest people knows
that if you throw if you if you push

128
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920
that if you throw if you if you push
 

129
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,030
that if you throw if you if you push
energy away from you you're never

130
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
energy away from you you're never
 

131
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,750
energy away from you you're never
getting it back the opponent will extend

132
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
getting it back the opponent will extend
 

133
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,830
getting it back the opponent will extend
it out where you will not have control

134
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:56,840
it out where you will not have control
 

135
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,069
it out where you will not have control
because it's away from your Center Line

136
00:03:59,069 --> 00:03:59,079
because it's away from your Center Line
 

137
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,789
because it's away from your Center Line
you're not as strong there your gravity

138
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:01,799
you're not as strong there your gravity
 

139
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,350
you're not as strong there your gravity
your your mass is not as heavy there and

140
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,360
your your mass is not as heavy there and
 

141
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,149
your your mass is not as heavy there and
so you never throw the opponent the

142
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
so you never throw the opponent the
 

143
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,110
so you never throw the opponent the
arreste the suspect outward with the

144
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,120
arreste the suspect outward with the
 

145
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,069
arreste the suspect outward with the
expectation that you're going to control

146
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
expectation that you're going to control
 

147
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,949
expectation that you're going to control
them okay but I think what a lot of iido

148
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
them okay but I think what a lot of iido
 

149
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,150
them okay but I think what a lot of iido
people

150
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
people
 

151
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,270
people
think is they see that he's on this

152
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
think is they see that he's on this
 

153
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,590
think is they see that he's on this
one-legged

154
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:22,600
one-legged
 

155
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,030
one-legged
base and then they push him off balance

156
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
base and then they push him off balance
 

157
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,629
base and then they push him off balance
so he falls like that okay

158
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
so he falls like that okay
 

159
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,590
so he falls like that okay
um and they think that's an advantage it

160
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
um and they think that's an advantage it
 

161
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,550
um and they think that's an advantage it
it might be maybe if I want to follow

162
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,560
it might be maybe if I want to follow
 

163
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,950
it might be maybe if I want to follow
him with a kick but not if I want to

164
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:37,960
him with a kick but not if I want to
 

165
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,790
him with a kick but not if I want to
control the arm okay so the first thing

166
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,800
control the arm okay so the first thing
 

167
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,150
control the arm okay so the first thing
to do is these Discovery learning

168
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,160
to do is these Discovery learning
 

169
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,990
to do is these Discovery learning
exercises

170
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,000

 

171
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,270

um so in most uh Dojo that I've seen

172
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,280
um so in most uh Dojo that I've seen
 

173
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,590
um so in most uh Dojo that I've seen
they're never in the center so they

174
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,600
they're never in the center so they
 

175
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,310
they're never in the center so they
never get here and this person is always

176
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
never get here and this person is always
 

177
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,430
never get here and this person is always
here when they shove them down this way

178
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440

 

179
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,310

see and

180
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
see and
 

181
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,629
see and
um again it looks like my foot is here

182
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:15,639
um again it looks like my foot is here
 

183
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,430
um again it looks like my foot is here
and then he pushes my Bas of support he

184
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,440
and then he pushes my Bas of support he
 

185
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,710
and then he pushes my Bas of support he
pushes my line of gravity out you end up

186
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
pushes my line of gravity out you end up
 

187
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,950
pushes my line of gravity out you end up
like

188
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
like
 

189
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,670
like
that but because I'm here and you have

190
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:26,680
that but because I'm here and you have
 

191
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,270
that but because I'm here and you have
to understand let me up for a second

192
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,280
to understand let me up for a second
 

193
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,350
to understand let me up for a second
stay there though

194
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,360
stay there though
 

195
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,790
stay there though
is the basis

196
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
is the basis
 

197
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,070
is the basis
support is the area of contact with the

198
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
support is the area of contact with the
 

199
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,029
support is the area of contact with the
Earth and then shaded in and I'm not off

200
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:40,039
Earth and then shaded in and I'm not off
 

201
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,110
Earth and then shaded in and I'm not off
balance until my line of Gravity Falls

202
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
balance until my line of Gravity Falls
 

203
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,070

outside of that Bas of

204
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
outside of that Bas of
 

205
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,469
outside of that Bas of
support So if you look when I'm here and

206
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
support So if you look when I'm here and
 

207
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,150
support So if you look when I'm here and
now I have that hand then I have a

208
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
now I have that hand then I have a
 

209
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,110
now I have that hand then I have a
larger Bas of support from this triangle

210
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,120
larger Bas of support from this triangle
 

211
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,150
larger Bas of support from this triangle
to these three bases okay and

212
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
to these three bases okay and
 

213
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,070
to these three bases okay and
um there's nothing he can do to stop me

214
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
um there's nothing he can do to stop me
 

215
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,629
um there's nothing he can do to stop me
putting that hand

216
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
putting that hand
 

217
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,230
putting that hand
anywhere so now I'm

218
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
anywhere so now I'm
 

219
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,350
anywhere so now I'm
pretty big of a base and he has to get

220
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
pretty big of a base and he has to get
 

221
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,469
pretty big of a base and he has to get
my line of gravity from here all the way

222
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
my line of gravity from here all the way
 

223
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,749
my line of gravity from here all the way
past that base so he's going to try

224
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:22,759

 

225
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,110

that and that's kind of what you feel in

226
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,120
that and that's kind of what you feel in
 

227
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,990
that and that's kind of what you feel in
real life and and of course because my

228
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,000
real life and and of course because my
 

229
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,150
real life and and of course because my
picture elbow control is Not underneath

230
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
picture elbow control is Not underneath
 

231
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,070
picture elbow control is Not underneath
his Center but out here I he can't

232
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
his Center but out here I he can't
 

233
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,070
his Center but out here I he can't
control that and I can use that base to

234
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
control that and I can use that base to
 

235
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,110
control that and I can use that base to

just pull your arm

248
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,400
just pull your arm
 

249
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,670
just pull your arm
back and attack the leg those are the

250
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:10,680
back and attack the leg those are the
 

251
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,950

first three Discovery learnings okay

252
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
first three Discovery learnings okay
 

253
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,950
first three Discovery learnings okay
let's try

254
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:13,960
let's try
 

255
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,710
let's try
it okay so this these three Discovery

256
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:17,720
it okay so this these three Discovery
 

257
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,909
it okay so this these three Discovery
learnings are all necessary to

258
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:20,919
learnings are all necessary to
 

259
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,629
learnings are all necessary to
understand

260
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
understand
 

261
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,670
understand
because modern iido seeks to control the

262
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
because modern iido seeks to control the
 

263
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,070
because modern iido seeks to control the
body through the arm as opposed to

264
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,080
body through the arm as opposed to
 

265
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,710
body through the arm as opposed to
control the body then the arm becomes

266
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:31,720
control the body then the arm becomes
 

267
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,990
control the body then the arm becomes
isolatable that's that's the way the

268
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
isolatable that's that's the way the
 

269
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,110
isolatable that's that's the way the
rest of the martial arts Community does

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
rest of the martial arts Community does
 

271
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,230
rest of the martial arts Community does
it except for iido they're going to get

272
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
it except for iido they're going to get
 

273
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,749
it except for iido they're going to get
your arm and they're going to you're

274
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
your arm and they're going to you're
 

275
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,950
your arm and they're going to you're
going to control people from that it

276
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:41,960
going to control people from that it
 

277
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,029
going to control people from that it
doesn't work like that okay um here's

278
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
doesn't work like that okay um here's
 

279
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,350
doesn't work like that okay um here's
another

280
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
another
 

281
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,510
another
one which works off that same state

282
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,520
one which works off that same state
 

283
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,189
one which works off that same state
okay um let's say I'm not strong enough

284
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
okay um let's say I'm not strong enough
 

285
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,350
okay um let's say I'm not strong enough
because this is a matter of Leverage

286
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
because this is a matter of Leverage
 

287
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,070
because this is a matter of Leverage
it's just such Superior Leverage

288
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
it's just such Superior Leverage
 

289
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,070
it's just such Superior Leverage
uh that it that you can just hold your

290
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
uh that it that you can just hold your
 

291
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,830
uh that it that you can just hold your
base here but if I wasn't strong enough

292
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
base here but if I wasn't strong enough
 

293
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,869

here the next to Discovery learning is

296
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:13,479
here the next to Discovery learning is
 

297
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,950
here the next to Discovery learning is
you can always move your

Bas okay and he can enter and

300
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
Bas okay and he can enter and
 

301
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,390
Bas okay and he can enter and
enter however many

302
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
enter however many
 

303
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,390
enter however many
times it's not ever going to

304
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,400
times it's not ever going to
 

305
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,149
times it's not ever going to
change or

306
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:30,159
change or
 

307
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,110
change or
you can extend his energy so as he's

308
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
you can extend his energy so as he's
 

309
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,949
you can extend his energy so as he's
pushing out I extend his

310
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
pushing out I extend his
 

311
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,750
pushing out I extend his
energy and he can't control it so those

312
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
energy and he can't control it so those
 

313
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,509
energy and he can't control it so those
two Discovery learning exercises now try

314
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
two Discovery learning exercises now try
 

315
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,150
two Discovery learning exercises now try
those now again as I talked to Juan a

316
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
those now again as I talked to Juan a
 

317
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,150
those now again as I talked to Juan a
lot of my stuff comes out of my fight

318
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
lot of my stuff comes out of my fight
 

319
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,190
lot of my stuff comes out of my fight

00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,910
somebody who does not want to be
arrested you you just learn really

328
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
arrested you you just learn really
 

329
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,110
arrested you you just learn really
quickly I I can't control I can't pin

330
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
quickly I I can't control I can't pin
 

331
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,630
quickly I I can't control I can't pin
someone I can't stabilize someone I

332
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:05,640
someone I can't stabilize someone I
 

333
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,069
someone I can't stabilize someone I
can't reduce the mobility of someone by

334
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:09,079
can't reduce the mobility of someone by
 

335
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,949
can't reduce the mobility of someone by
sending them away from me that's for

336
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
sending them away from me that's for
 

337
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,990
sending them away from me that's for
throwing okay uh you also learn that

338
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
throwing okay uh you also learn that
 

339
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,269
throwing okay uh you also learn that
arms don't make themselves available you

340
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:16,279
arms don't make themselves available you
 

341
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,310
arms don't make themselves available you
can't find the body from the arm you

342
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
can't find the body from the arm you
 

343
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,269
can't find the body from the arm you
first take the body then you find the

344
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
first take the body then you find the
 

345
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,110
first take the body then you find the
arm that's the order okay um but even if

346
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
arm that's the order okay um but even if
 

347
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,069
arm that's the order okay um but even if
you didn't do these exercises and Ivan

348
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,079
you didn't do these exercises and Ivan
 

349
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,990
you didn't do these exercises and Ivan
and you were in the bonai

350
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
and you were in the bonai
 

351
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,949
and you were in the bonai
lineage there is a style to the ukemi

352
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:37,959
lineage there is a style to the ukemi
 

353
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,150
lineage there is a style to the ukemi
that

354
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
that
 

355
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,030
that
exposes exactly what we just

356
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,040
exposes exactly what we just
 

357
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,269
exposes exactly what we just
demonstrated here as counters to that

358
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:44,279
demonstrated here as counters to that
 

359
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,350
demonstrated here as counters to that
technique okay

360
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,360
technique okay
 

361
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,030
technique okay
so

362
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,040
so
 

363
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,310
so
um he's going to be here and when he

364
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
um he's going to be here and when he
 

365
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,110
um he's going to be here and when he
shoves me over the good hook is will

366
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,120
shoves me over the good hook is will
 

367
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,150
shoves me over the good hook is will
always put that foot over there because

368
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
always put that foot over there because
 

369
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,190
always put that foot over there because
of the energy that's actually wants them

370
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
of the energy that's actually wants them
 

371
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,590
of the energy that's actually wants them
to extend it like that and so it's very

372
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
to extend it like that and so it's very
 

373
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,389
to extend it like that and so it's very
stylistic that all the good

374
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:11,399
stylistic that all the good
 

375
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,190
stylistic that all the good
ukas you go go like you mean it all

376
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,200
ukas you go go like you mean it all
 

377
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,030
ukas you go go like you mean it all
right go you'll see them do that kind of

378
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
right go you'll see them do that kind of
 

379
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,949
right go you'll see them do that kind of
stuff you see and that whole energy

380
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:19,959
stuff you see and that whole energy
 

381
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,069
stuff you see and that whole energy
there is to stop me from keep

382
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:25,079
there is to stop me from keep
 

383
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,150
there is to stop me from keep
rolling

384
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160

 

385
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,069

okay with which is why your crappy

386
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
okay with which is why your crappy
 

387
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,790
okay with which is why your crappy
ukes crappy ukes in the

388
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:35,800
ukes crappy ukes in the
 

389
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,389
ukes crappy ukes in the
bonai go like this do you see and then

390
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:41,399
bonai go like this do you see and then
 

391
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,750
bonai go like this do you see and then
we beat the out of them for landing

392
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
we beat the out of them for landing
 

393
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,949
we beat the out of them for landing
supine when they weren't supposed to or

394
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
supine when they weren't supposed to or
 

395
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,150
supine when they weren't supposed to or
we train them hey put your foot back

396
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
we train them hey put your foot back
 

397
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,590
we train them hey put your foot back
here get your hip up and we say like

398
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
here get your hip up and we say like
 

399
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,990
here get your hip up and we say like
stay alive but you're you're not staying

400
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
stay alive but you're you're not staying
 

401
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,030
stay alive but you're you're not staying
alive you're actually dead okay all

402
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
alive you're actually dead okay all
 

403
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,150
alive you're actually dead okay all
right so we'll play with

404
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,160
right so we'll play with
 

405
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,430
right so we'll play with
that all right so if you look at all of

406
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
that all right so if you look at all of
 

407
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,470
that all right so if you look at all of
this stuff here it all and this is the

408
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
this stuff here it all and this is the
 

409
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,350
this stuff here it all and this is the
part that's the most

410
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:10,360
part that's the most
 

411
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,710
part that's the most
problematic is that the elbow control is

412
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:13,720
problematic is that the elbow control is
 

413
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,430
problematic is that the elbow control is
not under my Center you see the elbow

414
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,440
not under my Center you see the elbow
 

415
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,069
not under my Center you see the elbow
control is not under my center it's off

416
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:19,079
control is not under my center it's off
 

417
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,829
control is not under my center it's off
to the right either at the Young line or

418
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
to the right either at the Young line or
 

419
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,509
to the right either at the Young line or
outside of the Y Line as it is in this

420
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
outside of the Y Line as it is in this
 

421
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,230
outside of the Y Line as it is in this
case do you see and then the next

422
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
case do you see and then the next
 

423
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,829
case do you see and then the next
assumption is

424
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:30,839
assumption is
 

425
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,910
assumption is
that this

426
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:32,920
that this
 

427
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,269
that this
is um a

428
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
is um a
 

429
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,110
is um a
shikaku so cooperate please that you can

430
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,120
shikaku so cooperate please that you can
 

431
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,430
shikaku so cooperate please that you can
now and he will fall into that but he

432
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
now and he will fall into that but he
 

433
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,470
now and he will fall into that but he
goes

434
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
goes
 

435
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,430
goes
back and again you have to

436
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
back and again you have to
 

437
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,949
back and again you have to
think in terms of the kinesiological

438
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
think in terms of the kinesiological
 

439
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,470
think in terms of the kinesiological
elements Bas to support line of gravity

440
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
elements Bas to support line of gravity
 

441
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,670
elements Bas to support line of gravity
so his his line of gravity is full on in

442
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:58,680
so his his line of gravity is full on in
 

443
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,509
so his his line of gravity is full on in
his Bas of support which is his whole

444
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
his Bas of support which is his whole
 

445
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,110
his Bas of support which is his whole
body it's not over here outside of his

446
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,120
body it's not over here outside of his
 

447
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,990
body it's not over here outside of his
Bas of support so when I try to pull

448
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
Bas of support so when I try to pull
 

449
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,350
Bas of support so when I try to pull
this there's no effing way that I can

450
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,360
this there's no effing way that I can
 

451
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,750
this there's no effing way that I can
get

452
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,760
get
 

453
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,590
get
this over there there's absolutely no

454
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
this over there there's absolutely no
 

455
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,790
this over there there's absolutely no
way okay uh so we'll do that next

456
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
way okay uh so we'll do that next
 

457
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,870
way okay uh so we'll do that next
Discovery learning exercise so you went

458
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:23,880
Discovery learning exercise so you went
 

459
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,590
Discovery learning exercise so you went
outside you sent the energy outside your

460
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:26,600
outside you sent the energy outside your
 

461
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,829
outside you sent the energy outside your
y line now you're going to try to bring

462
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:28,839
y line now you're going to try to bring
 

463
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,150
y line now you're going to try to bring
it back back and you're going to feel it

464
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
it back back and you're going to feel it
 

465
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,230
it back back and you're going to feel it
doesn't ever come back okay all right

466
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
doesn't ever come back okay all right
 

467
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,870
doesn't ever come back okay all right
try it

468
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:33,880
try it
 

469
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,829
try it
out okay so again normally this all

470
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
out okay so again normally this all
 

471
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,509
out okay so again normally this all
works but it works because the UK is

472
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:40,519
works but it works because the UK is
 

473
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,550
works but it works because the UK is
making it work the the UK is putting

474
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
making it work the the UK is putting
 

475
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,430
making it work the the UK is putting
their foot back right and then the UK is

476
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
their foot back right and then the UK is
 

477
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,750
their foot back right and then the UK is
not resisting and laying down for you on

478
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
not resisting and laying down for you on
 

479
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,509
not resisting and laying down for you on
that second part um but you could see

480
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:50,519
that second part um but you could see
 

481
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,550
that second part um but you could see
architecturally that you're already

482
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
architecturally that you're already
 

483
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,350
architecturally that you're already
you're already violating sound body

484
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
you're already violating sound body
 

485
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,670
you're already violating sound body
mechanics your control point should be

486
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
mechanics your control point should be
 

487
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,269
mechanics your control point should be
underneath your Center sound energetic

488
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
underneath your Center sound energetic

throwing architectures
okay um and this is going to be a pin so

498
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
okay um and this is going to be a pin so
 

499
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,629
okay um and this is going to be a pin so
there's some other things too there is

00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:21,639
there's some other things too there is
 

501
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,550
there's some other things too there is
the overall energetics and the

alchemical principles to pay attention
 

505
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,110
alchemical principles to pay attention
to and in particularly as as they uh

506
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
to and in particularly as as they uh
 

507
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,710

deal with non-c contestation because

508
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
deal with non-c contestation because
 

509
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,670
deal with non-c contestation because
those other things could actually work

510
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:34,680
those other things could actually work
 

511
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,470
those other things could actually work
if you had enough Yong to make relevant

512

okay um but that won't make them right
 

517
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,189
okay um but that won't make them right
just because you were strong enough to

going to be wrong okay so we have to

522
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
going to be wrong okay so we have to
 

523
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,030
going to be wrong okay so we have to
look at what we're doing we know we

524
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,040
look at what we're doing we know we
 

525
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,550
look at what we're doing we know we
attack the body and as the body is

526
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
attack the body and as the body is
 

527
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,629
attack the body and as the body is
experiencing kazushi we know that it's

528
00:13:59,629 --> 00:13:59,639
experiencing kazushi we know that it's
 

529
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,150
experiencing kazushi we know that it's
going to go around and inside me because

530
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,160
going to go around and inside me because
 

531
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,710
going to go around and inside me because
that's the way the body wants to fall

532
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,720
that's the way the body wants to fall
 

533
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,710
that's the way the body wants to fall
once we create this pattern the leg

534
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:07,720
once we create this pattern the leg
 

535
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,990
once we create this pattern the leg
wants to swing around the head wants to

536
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
wants to swing around the head wants to
 

537
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,710
wants to swing around the head wants to
go

538
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
go
 

539
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,350
go
in uh we also

540
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
in uh we also
 

541
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,389
in uh we also
know that there's going to be resistance

542
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
know that there's going to be resistance
 

543
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,310
know that there's going to be resistance
on this elbow because he doesn't want to

544
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,320
on this elbow because he doesn't want to
 

545
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,350
on this elbow because he doesn't want to
go down so I can't shove him down I have

546
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
go down so I can't shove him down I have
 

547
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,269
go down so I can't shove him down I have
to bring this around me that's what I do

548
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279
to bring this around me that's what I do
 

549
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,590
to bring this around me that's what I do
because I have to do a 90° fluctuation

550
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,600
because I have to do a 90° fluctuation
 

551
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,749
because I have to do a 90° fluctuation
to the contest so that I don't

552
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:30,759
to the contest so that I don't
 

553
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,389
to the contest so that I don't
participate in it okay um so as we're

554
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
participate in it okay um so as we're
 

555
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,749
participate in it okay um so as we're
going

556
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:36,759
going
 

557
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,790
going
along I picked this up at the wui line

558
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:41,800
along I picked this up at the wui line
 

559
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,550
along I picked this up at the wui line
this hand as I start to go

560
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:45,560
this hand as I start to go
 

561
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,230
this hand as I start to go
through this hand is going to attack uh

562
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
through this hand is going to attack uh
 

563
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,829
through this hand is going to attack uh
the height

564
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:53,560
Dimension
 

567
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,350
Dimension
as it fuels this hand on the width

568
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
as it fuels this hand on the width
 

569
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,829
as it fuels this hand on the width
dimension so what I mean by that is this

570
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:00,839
dimension so what I mean by that is this
 

571
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,389
dimension so what I mean by that is this
hand keeps turning this to keep that

572
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
hand keeps turning this to keep that
 

573

shoulder

574
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,560
shoulder
 

575
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,350
shoulder
down as it brings it over to the Y Line

576
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,360
down as it brings it over to the Y Line
 

577
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,749
down as it brings it over to the Y Line
here this

578
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:15,759

 

579
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,269

way as it goes this way that creates the

580
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
way as it goes this way that creates the
 

581
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,990
way as it goes this way that creates the
adhesion that I need on the elbow to now

582
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,000
adhesion that I need on the elbow to now
 

583
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,990
adhesion that I need on the elbow to now
assist with that

584
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,000
assist with that
 

585
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,230
assist with that
turning of his elbow this way take keep

586
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,240
turning of his elbow this way take keep
 

587
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,870
turning of his elbow this way take keep
that shoulder going down so that I aim

588
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:31,880
that shoulder going down so that I aim
 

589
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,230
that shoulder going down so that I aim
his falling

590
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
his falling
 

591
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,069
his falling
body and it looks like this and it ends

592
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
body and it looks like this and it ends
 

593
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,110
body and it looks like this and it ends
under my

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
under my
 

595
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,350
under my
Center so uh rewind

slightly because this is turning his
 

599
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,629
slightly because this is turning his
shoulder down and this is turning his

600
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:51,639
shoulder down and this is turning his
 

601
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,550
shoulder down and this is turning his
shoulder down he's not going up like the

602

shoulder down he's not going up like the
 

603
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,749
shoulder down he's not going up like the
other technique see I'm not sh in him

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,310
okay and that's how you can tell am I
doing it right and and the reason this

656
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,320
doing it right and and the reason this
 

657
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,909
doing it right and and the reason this
head goes

658
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:18,919
head goes
 

659
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,549
head goes
around is because as I transfer from

660
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:23,559
around is because as I transfer from
 

661
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,149
around is because as I transfer from
body control there to wrist control to

662
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:27,159
body control there to wrist control to
 

663
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,909
body control there to wrist control to
Elbow control I'm not pushing him away

664
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
Elbow control I'm not pushing him away
 

665
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,590
Elbow control I'm not pushing him away
like that that makes his head go that

666
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:32,600
like that that makes his head go that
 

667
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,270
like that that makes his head go that
way I'm bringing him in and down in and

668
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
way I'm bringing him in and down in and
 

669
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,390
way I'm bringing him in and down in and
down his head comes with its arm which

670
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
down his head comes with its arm which
 

671
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,510
down his head comes with its arm which
is telling you now I am controlling his

672
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:44,520
is telling you now I am controlling his
 

673
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,350
is telling you now I am controlling his
body from the arm

674
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
body from the arm
 

675
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,190
body from the arm
okay

676
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
okay
 

677
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,070
okay
um might as well do the second part so

678
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,080
um might as well do the second part so
 

679
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,070
um might as well do the second part so
the second part is he's laying

680
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,080
the second part is he's laying
 

681
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,230
the second part is he's laying
down and we'll have the other

682
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
down and we'll have the other
 

683
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,990
down and we'll have the other
technique and this is the one we already

684
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
technique and this is the one we already
 

685
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,070
technique and this is the one we already
know this is not

686
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,080
know this is not
 

687
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,669
know this is not
possible and this should not have been

688
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:10,679
possible and this should not have been
 

689
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,029
possible and this should not have been
there this should been

690
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,039

 

691
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,950

here and his head should be there

692
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:19,960
here and his head should be there
 

693
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,510
here and his head should be there
okay even if he's a little

694
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
okay even if he's a little
 

695
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,270
okay even if he's a little
up sometimes I don't wait for the whole

696
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
up sometimes I don't wait for the whole
 

697
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,789
up sometimes I don't wait for the whole
pin you don't don't

698
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:29,799
pin you don't don't
 

699
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,149
pin you don't don't
pull you don't pull that way you're

700
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:33,159
pull you don't pull that way you're
 

701
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,149
pull you don't pull that way you're
going to make this is the contesting

702
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:36,159
going to make this is the contesting
 

703
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,430
going to make this is the contesting
angle so shoving it is

704
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,440
angle so shoving it is
 

705
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,110
angle so shoving it is
contesting you are going to go up

706
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
contesting you are going to go up
 

707
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,190
contesting you are going to go up
it he doesn't want to go that way you go

708
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
it he doesn't want to go that way you go
 

709
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,750
it he doesn't want to go that way you go
up

710
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760

 

711
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,909

it and when you go up

712
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:54,919
it and when you go up
 

713
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,950
it and when you go up
it you will not you'll make this

714
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:57,960
it you will not you'll make this
 

715
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,029
it you will not you'll make this
shoulder go down down not by pulling it

716
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:00,039
shoulder go down down not by pulling it
 

717
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,350
shoulder go down down not by pulling it
and he falls but by attacking the

718
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
and he falls but by attacking the
 

719
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,830
and he falls but by attacking the
joint this way like

720
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:06,840
joint this way like
 

721
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,630
joint this way like
that with your

722
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:09,640
that with your
 

723
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,510
that with your
body now the shoulders

724
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520

 

725
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,470

pin

726
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:17,480
pin
 

727
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,310
pin
so now youve made your figure eight we

728
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,320
so now youve made your figure eight we
 

729
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,350
so now youve made your figure eight we
go on he goes around me ohom now I go

730
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,360
go on he goes around me ohom now I go
 

731
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,590
go on he goes around me ohom now I go
around him

732
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:30,600

 

733
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,909

and so there should

734
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
and so there should
 

735
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,750
and so there should
be three pins in the

736
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:34,760
be three pins in the
 

737
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,110
be three pins in the
technique the first

738
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
technique the first
 

739
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,230
technique the first
one is this brake here crack right there

740
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
one is this brake here crack right there
 

741
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,149
one is this brake here crack right there
the second one is when I come around

742
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:45,159
the second one is when I come around
 

743
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,430
the second one is when I come around
it's right here on the elbow and the

744
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
it's right here on the elbow and the
 

745
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,070
it's right here on the elbow and the
third one is a shoulder dislocation when

746
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
third one is a shoulder dislocation when
 

747
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,430
third one is a shoulder dislocation when
you come through okay so you could do

748
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
you come through okay so you could do
 

749
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,710
you come through okay so you could do
that you got him here get the tap here

750
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
that you got him here get the tap here
 

751
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,830
that you got him here get the tap here
on the elbow

752
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:58,840
on the elbow
 

753
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,230
on the elbow
then the break here on the elbow and

754
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
then the break here on the elbow and
 

755
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,270
then the break here on the elbow and
then the

756
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,280
then the
 

757
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,789
then the
shoulder dislocation there that's

758
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
shoulder dislocation there that's
 

759
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,029
shoulder dislocation there that's
telling you you have the right vectors

760
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
telling you you have the right vectors
 

761
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,630
telling you you have the right vectors
through the arm but the pattern

762
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
through the arm but the pattern
 

763
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,110
through the arm but the pattern
is around

764
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
is around
 

765
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,470
is around
me around him that's what you're doing

766
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
me around him that's what you're doing
 

767
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,710
me around him that's what you're doing
boom around

768
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
boom around
 

769
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,789
boom around
me around him

770
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
me around him
 

771
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,230
me around him
okay we'll try it go right so uh the the

772
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,240
okay we'll try it go right so uh the the
 

773
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,750
okay we'll try it go right so uh the the
first part is he's he's doing spinal

774
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
first part is he's he's doing spinal
 

775
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,669
first part is he's he's doing spinal
displacement

776
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
displacement
 

777
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,310
displacement
okay and you're yielding right and

778
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,320
okay and you're yielding right and
 

779
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,750
okay and you're yielding right and
projecting right there there's your

780
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
projecting right there there's your
 

781
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,669
projecting right there there's your
projection it's not it's not me going

782
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:44,679
projection it's not it's not me going
 

783
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,750
projection it's not it's not me going
into his shoulder and trying to get his

784
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:48,760
into his shoulder and trying to get his
 

785
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,230
into his shoulder and trying to get his
arm he's

786
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,240
arm he's
 

787
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,230
arm he's
projecting that's

788
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,240
projecting that's
 

789
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,510
projecting that's
it

790
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520

 

791
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:49,029

technique e

792
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039

 

793
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,269

then as you

794
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:52,279
then as you
 

795
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:54,269
then as you
watch this

796
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:54,279
watch this
 

797
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,269
watch this
part pay attention because it doesn't

798
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:57,279
part pay attention because it doesn't
 

799
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,070
part pay attention because it doesn't
really take

800
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,080
really take
 

801
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,950
really take
if I crank here it's going to take some

802
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
if I crank here it's going to take some
 

803
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,390
if I crank here it's going to take some
strength but as I start turning over

804
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
strength but as I start turning over
 

805
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,710
strength but as I start turning over
here it doesn't take strength and the

806
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
here it doesn't take strength and the
 

807
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,750
here it doesn't take strength and the
same thing here if I shove down here

808
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
same thing here if I shove down here
 

809
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,750
same thing here if I shove down here
it's going to take some strength but I

810
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:12,760
it's going to take some strength but I
 

811
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,630
it's going to take some strength but I
don't need strength at this point don't

812
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:15,640
don't need strength at this point don't
 

813
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,710
don't need strength at this point don't
need strength okay because I'm not ever

814
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:19,720
need strength okay because I'm not ever
 

815
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,190
need strength okay because I'm not ever
contesting he was falling from the

816
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,200
contesting he was falling from the
 

817
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,630
contesting he was falling from the
beginning and I just aim him be the arm

818
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:25,640
beginning and I just aim him be the arm
 

819
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,710
beginning and I just aim him be the arm
isolation that opened up from the attack

820
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:27,720
isolation that opened up from the attack
 

821
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,029
isolation that opened up from the attack
on the center the kazushi that is what

822
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:30,039
