1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,150

okay so continuing on

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
okay so continuing on
 

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,550
okay so continuing on
with the kozushi okay and this time

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
with the kozushi okay and this time
 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,190
with the kozushi okay and this time
we're going to go over the knee pull

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
we're going to go over the knee pull
 

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,390
we're going to go over the knee pull
so the knee pull

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
so the knee pull
 

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,470
so the knee pull
is going to work off his spinal

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
is going to work off his spinal
 

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,590
is going to work off his spinal
necessity for his posture okay it's

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
necessity for his posture okay it's
 

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,269
necessity for his posture okay it's
nothing but

14
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
nothing but
 

15
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,630
nothing but
a lever so if i try to pull

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
a lever so if i try to pull
 

17
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,070
a lever so if i try to pull
his uh line of gravity out of his face

18
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
his uh line of gravity out of his face
 

19
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,710
his uh line of gravity out of his face
support

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
support
 

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,349
support
from the bottom of the spine that's a

22
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
from the bottom of the spine that's a
 

23
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,630
from the bottom of the spine that's a
short lever

24
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
short lever
 

25
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,549
short lever
i won't have as good a mechanical

26
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
i won't have as good a mechanical
 

27
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,750
i won't have as good a mechanical
advantage

28
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
advantage
 

29
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,750
advantage
so i want to come near the top of the

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
so i want to come near the top of the
 

31
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,350
so i want to come near the top of the
spines and i'm doing that

32
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
spines and i'm doing that
 

33
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,470
spines and i'm doing that
so i'm coming towards the armpits and i

34
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
so i'm coming towards the armpits and i
 

35
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,910
so i'm coming towards the armpits and i
start to bring his line of gravity

36
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
start to bring his line of gravity
 

37
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,389
start to bring his line of gravity
up his body his center of gravity falls

38
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
up his body his center of gravity falls
 

39
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,389
up his body his center of gravity falls
outside his base support

40
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
outside his base support
 

41
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,709
outside his base support
and his balance becomes um

42
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
and his balance becomes um
 

43
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,869
and his balance becomes um
off balance okay so just working with

44
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
off balance okay so just working with
 

45
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,390
off balance okay so just working with
the knee pull

46
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400

 

47
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,630

you'll do it from the side

48
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640

 

49
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,789

and as you're doing just like all parts

50
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
and as you're doing just like all parts
 

51
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,990
and as you're doing just like all parts
of the closed guard

52
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
of the closed guard
 

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,030
of the closed guard
don't waste your groin muscles closing

54
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
don't waste your groin muscles closing
 

55
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,350
don't waste your groin muscles closing
this

56
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
this
 

57
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,910
this
off what is just key is that your hips

58
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
off what is just key is that your hips
 

59
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,030
off what is just key is that your hips
are on top and

60
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
are on top and
 

61
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,910
are on top and
in front of his hips okay so as i come

62
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
in front of his hips okay so as i come
 

63
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,710
in front of his hips okay so as i come
up i'm not squeezing any harder

64
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
up i'm not squeezing any harder
 

65
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,749
up i'm not squeezing any harder
just move

66
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759

 

67
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,630

his line of gravity up his spine center

68
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
his line of gravity up his spine center
 

69
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,510
his line of gravity up his spine center
of gravity falls outside his face

70
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520

 

71
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,310

and then we'll look at the four phases

72
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
and then we'll look at the four phases
 

73
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,710
and then we'll look at the four phases
of

74
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
of
 

75
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,350
of
getting up so we just did knees down

76
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
getting up so we just did knees down
 

77
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,429
getting up so we just did knees down
we'll do one leg up

78
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
we'll do one leg up
 

79
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,950
we'll do one leg up
and you'll do the same thing

80
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960

 

81
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,830

same exercise just working on the knee

82
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
same exercise just working on the knee
 

83
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:02,950
same exercise just working on the knee
pull

84
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960

 

85
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,270

then we'll pay attention to the second

86
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
then we'll pay attention to the second
 

87
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,389
then we'll pay attention to the second
step

88
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
step
 

89
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,550
step
so he goes one and as he starts to go

90
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
so he goes one and as he starts to go
 

91
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:20,830
so he goes one and as he starts to go
do it

92
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

93
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,949

one

94
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959

 

95
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,630

okay let's go okay so of course if he

96
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
okay let's go okay so of course if he
 

97
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,509
okay let's go okay so of course if he
gets all the way up

98
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
gets all the way up
 

99
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,589
gets all the way up
and he drives his punch he's gonna have

100
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
and he drives his punch he's gonna have
 

101
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,750
and he drives his punch he's gonna have
way a lot of leverage so come down

102
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
way a lot of leverage so come down
 

103
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,630
way a lot of leverage so come down
but it's not so easy to get up he goes

104
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640

 

105
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,910

it's not so easy okay so

106
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
it's not so easy okay so
 

107
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,390
it's not so easy okay so
it's not uncommon that after a few

108
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
it's not uncommon that after a few
 

109
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,309
it's not uncommon that after a few
attempts this is where he starts trying

110
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
attempts this is where he starts trying
 

111
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,270
attempts this is where he starts trying
to punch you

112
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
to punch you
 

113
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,309
to punch you
okay so we're gonna work from here

114
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
okay so we're gonna work from here
 

115
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,430
okay so we're gonna work from here
but the same kazushi pattern would apply

116
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
but the same kazushi pattern would apply
 

117
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,110
but the same kazushi pattern would apply
okay so as he goes to this punch

118
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
okay so as he goes to this punch
 

119
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,750
okay so as he goes to this punch
i feel his line of gravity coming out i

120
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
i feel his line of gravity coming out i
 

121
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,869
i feel his line of gravity coming out i
feed it

122
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
feed it
 

123
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,070
feed it
and i use his arm to take him

124
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
and i use his arm to take him
 

125
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,869
and i use his arm to take him
into that kazushi pattern

126
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
into that kazushi pattern
 

127
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,550
into that kazushi pattern
that we worked on last week so

128
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
that we worked on last week so
 

129
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,869
that we worked on last week so
he goes i'm stuck i keep it going

130
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
he goes i'm stuck i keep it going
 

131
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:43,990
he goes i'm stuck i keep it going
just turn it boom and you're up

132
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000

 

133
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,880

a little clicker

134
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:48,890

139
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,550

okay so in this technique as he goes

140
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
okay so in this technique as he goes
 

141
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,429
okay so in this technique as he goes
back i'm not

142
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
back i'm not
 

143
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,190
back i'm not
this is not this is not gonna work okay

144
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
this is not this is not gonna work okay
 

145
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,070
this is not this is not gonna work okay
so as he as he goes to punch do you see

146
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
so as he as he goes to punch do you see
 

147
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,750
so as he as he goes to punch do you see
how i'm already affecting him

148
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
how i'm already affecting him
 

149
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,309
how i'm already affecting him
okay and so he's he's gonna correct he's

150
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
okay and so he's he's gonna correct he's
 

151
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,429
okay and so he's he's gonna correct he's
gonna throw his punch

152
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
gonna throw his punch
 

153
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,030
gonna throw his punch
and that's why that worked okay

154
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
and that's why that worked okay
 

155
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,589
and that's why that worked okay
so let's put a little energy into your

156
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
so let's put a little energy into your
 

157
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,050
so let's put a little energy into your
punches see i'm right there

158
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,060

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:57,430
okay
so he goes a little quicker

176
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440

 

177
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,950

you have intuition okay so he goes

178
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
you have intuition okay so he goes
 

179
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,790
you have intuition okay so he goes
and he's so light that i can go here

180
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
and he's so light that i can go here
 

181
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,909
and he's so light that i can go here
and just push him and get him

182
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919

 

183
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,909

okay so he goes are you gonna punch

184
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
okay so he goes are you gonna punch
 

185
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,270
okay so he goes are you gonna punch
here we go there you go well

186
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
here we go there you go well
 

187
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,230
here we go there you go well
then this will work

188
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
then this will work
 

189
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,670
then this will work
he's stronger

190
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680

 

191
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,629

and i cannot do the move embryonically i

192
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
and i cannot do the move embryonically i
 

193
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,430
and i cannot do the move embryonically i
can't go

194
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
can't go
 

195
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,670
can't go
balance and then you you're thinking

196
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
balance and then you you're thinking
 

197
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,350
balance and then you you're thinking
you're gonna do some scissor sweep or

198
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
you're gonna do some scissor sweep or
 

199
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,390
you're gonna do some scissor sweep or
something here

200
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
something here
 

201
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,710
something here
he's really strong i can't get it

202
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
he's really strong i can't get it
 

203
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,830
he's really strong i can't get it
so just like in touch he was that lucas

204
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
so just like in touch he was that lucas
 

205
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,230
so just like in touch he was that lucas
uh center of gravity never stops

206
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
uh center of gravity never stops
 

207
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,830
uh center of gravity never stops
traversing the map

208
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
traversing the map
 

209
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,110
traversing the map
so as he goes it's moving forward

210
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
so as he goes it's moving forward
 

211
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,670
so as he goes it's moving forward
you see it keeps going forward look

212
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
you see it keeps going forward look
 

213
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,790
you see it keeps going forward look
slowly

214
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
slowly
 

215
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,309
slowly
surely

216
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319

 

217
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,749

so if he does this move

218
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
so if he does this move
 

219
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,749
so if he does this move
what i would call embryonically

220
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
what i would call embryonically
 

221
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,350
what i would call embryonically
mechanically

222
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
mechanically
 

223
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,510
mechanically
he'll never do it that's why they have

224
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
he'll never do it that's why they have
 

225
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,950
he'll never do it that's why they have
weight categories

226
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
weight categories
 

227
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,870
weight categories
okay because everyone does their moves

228
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
okay because everyone does their moves
 

229
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,469
okay because everyone does their moves
that way nowadays

230
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
that way nowadays
 

231
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,070
that way nowadays
so he goes boom

232
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
so he goes boom
 

233
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,749
so he goes boom
he's never gonna get me i'm gonna be

234
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
he's never gonna get me i'm gonna be
 

235
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,590
he's never gonna get me i'm gonna be
dynamic

236
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
dynamic
 

237
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,950
dynamic
and just move

238
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
and just move
 

239
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,990
and just move
or maybe i'm trained

240
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
or maybe i'm trained
 

241
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,629
or maybe i'm trained
and uh move to the side

242
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639

 

243
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,909

and he's gonna push me stand up and i

um i don't want it to come over where i

308
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
um i don't want it to come over where i
 

309
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,270
um i don't want it to come over where i
would do the

310
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
would do the
 

311
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,110
would do the
the overlook here okay so

312
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
the overlook here okay so
 

313
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,550
the overlook here okay so
same thing i go and i'm using the punch

314
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
same thing i go and i'm using the punch
 

315
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,629
same thing i go and i'm using the punch
to keep his line of gravity going

316
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
to keep his line of gravity going
 

317
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,350
to keep his line of gravity going
forward don't come off him

318
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
forward don't come off him
 

319
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,070
forward don't come off him
and don't let him come off of you so he

320
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
and don't let him come off of you so he
 

321
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,230
and don't let him come off of you so he
he's trying to come off of me

322
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
he's trying to come off of me
 

323
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,629
he's trying to come off of me
don't let him come off of you okay he

324
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
don't let him come off of you okay he
 

325
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,749
don't let him come off of you okay he
drops his elbow

326
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
drops his elbow
 

327
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,469
drops his elbow
don't let it come off of you keep your

328
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
don't let it come off of you keep your
 

329
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,070
don't let it come off of you keep your
ikey adhesion

330
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
ikey adhesion
 

331
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,790
ikey adhesion
so he goes long keep it

332
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
so he goes long keep it
 

333
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,110
so he goes long keep it
until it's no longer affecting his

334
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
until it's no longer affecting his
 

335
