171
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,630
we'd to me we'd have the most perfect
art because there's fluidity

172
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
art because there's fluidity
 

173
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,869
art because there's fluidity
in the aikikai style what is beautiful

174
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
in the aikikai style what is beautiful
 

175
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,309
in the aikikai style what is beautiful
but to me that

176
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
but to me that
 

177
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,149
but to me that
that little sliver that someone got

178
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
that little sliver that someone got
 

179
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,830
that little sliver that someone got
if we can put that back in the cake

180
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
if we can put that back in the cake
 

181
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,350
if we can put that back in the cake
then we should have everything we should

182
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
then we should have everything we should
 

183
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,350
then we should have everything we should
have confidence to be able to overcome

184
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
have confidence to be able to overcome
 

185
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,630
have confidence to be able to overcome
strength

186
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
strength
 

187
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,270
strength
and we should have fluidity

188
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and we should have fluidity
 

189
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,670
and we should have fluidity
cytosense he told me off because i'd

190
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
cytosense he told me off because i'd
 

191

done an interview with sam cranny

192
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
done an interview with sam cranny
 

193
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,469
done an interview with sam cranny
and said trouble this isn't any fluidity

194
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
and said trouble this isn't any fluidity
 

195
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,390
and said trouble this isn't any fluidity
and he said

196
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
and he said
 

197
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,550
and he said
what's wrong

198
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
what's wrong
 

199
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:41,510
what's wrong
what's wrong with the fluid

200
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520

 

201
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,390

so the more strength you need

202
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
so the more strength you need
 

203
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,390
so the more strength you need
is the worse

204
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
is the worse
 

205
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,390
is the worse
the technique because you're using parts

206
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
the technique because you're using parts
 

207
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,909
the technique because you're using parts
of your body

208
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
of your body
 

209
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,230
of your body

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
your upper body or something
 

211
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,710
your upper body or something
right so enough said i'd like you to go

212
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
right so enough said i'd like you to go
 

213
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,469
right so enough said i'd like you to go
into threes

214
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
into threes
 

215
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,150
into threes
and do this

216
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
and do this
 

217
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,280
and do this
don't pick these two they're weak
