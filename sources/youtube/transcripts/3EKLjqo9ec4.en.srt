00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,429

this technique is tricky

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
this technique is tricky
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,950
this technique is tricky
because we've been doing it from the

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
because we've been doing it from the
 

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,750
because we've been doing it from the
beginning

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760

 

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,390

and our uks are not always as alive as

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
and our uks are not always as alive as
 

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,709
and our uks are not always as alive as
they should be

10
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
they should be
 

11
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,470
they should be
but you can still use the arts

12
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
but you can still use the arts
 

13
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,390
but you can still use the arts
principles to tell you whether it would

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
principles to tell you whether it would
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,710
principles to tell you whether it would
work or not

16
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
work or not
 

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,589
work or not
okay so my geometry

18
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
okay so my geometry
 

19
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,870
okay so my geometry
is a rotating spiraling

20
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
is a rotating spiraling
 

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,229
is a rotating spiraling
x so i have this

22
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
x so i have this
 

23
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,270
x so i have this
x and it is

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
x and it is
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,389
x and it is
rotating on itself and it's

26
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
rotating on itself and it's
 

27
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,549
rotating on itself and it's
traveling along a spiral as it does that

28
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
traveling along a spiral as it does that
 

29
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,110
traveling along a spiral as it does that
so it's not rotating in place that would

30
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
so it's not rotating in place that would
 

31
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,869
so it's not rotating in place that would
be a circle

32
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
be a circle
 

33
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,470
be a circle
and it's not staying still and doing a

34
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
and it's not staying still and doing a
 

35
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,830
and it's not staying still and doing a
spiral

36
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
spiral
 

37
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,389
spiral
and the reason for that is only the

38
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
and the reason for that is only the
 

39
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,830
and the reason for that is only the
rotating spiraling

40
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
rotating spiraling
 

41
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,270
rotating spiraling
cross continually

42
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
cross continually
 

43
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,990
cross continually

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,870
are being affected okay so
if i am doing ikyoura

54
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
if i am doing ikyoura
 

55
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,990
if i am doing ikyoura
and i'm going to go

56
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
and i'm going to go
 

57
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,469
and i'm going to go
here very common

58
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
here very common
 

59
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,230
here very common
because we think i'm going to pull it

60
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
because we think i'm going to pull it
 

61
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,990
because we think i'm going to pull it
under my center

62
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
under my center
 

63
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,350
under my center
and under my center is where i'm strung

64
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
and under my center is where i'm strung
 

65
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,270
and under my center is where i'm strung
and we picture this line

66
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
and we picture this line
 

67
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,350
and we picture this line
because i turn is a spiraling

68
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
because i turn is a spiraling
 

69
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,109
because i turn is a spiraling
rotating x but it is not

70
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
rotating x but it is not
 

71
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,230
rotating x but it is not
if you pay attention

72
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
if you pay attention
 

73
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,590
if you pay attention
it's a straight line

74
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600

 

75
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,709

with a circle at the end

76
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719

 

77
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,670

if you look at it from yin and yang it's

78
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
if you look at it from yin and yang it's
 

79
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,510
if you look at it from yin and yang it's
a pull

80
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520

 

81
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,869

so we're going to experience two

82
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
so we're going to experience two
 

83
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,430
so we're going to experience two
resistance okay one is

84
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
resistance okay one is
 

85
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,830
resistance okay one is
he doesn't come with me don't come with

86
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

87
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:34,830

me

88
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

89
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,150

oh

90
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
oh
 

91
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,990
oh
let's say i violate the art well enough

92
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
let's say i violate the art well enough
 

93
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,150
let's say i violate the art well enough
that i'm able to overcome that

94
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
that i'm able to overcome that
 

95
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,430
that i'm able to overcome that
resistance

96
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440

 

97
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,550

so i get it but it's

98
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
so i get it but it's
 

99
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,470
so i get it but it's
straight now with the turn

100
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
straight now with the turn
 

101
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,790
straight now with the turn
he can step under it and i can't get it

102
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
he can step under it and i can't get it
 

103
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,550
he can step under it and i can't get it
down

104
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
down
 

105
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,190
down
because i'm trying to overcome his

106
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200

 

107
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,270

so quadriceps strong enough to get it

108
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
so quadriceps strong enough to get it
 

109
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,390
so quadriceps strong enough to get it
under me

110
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
under me
 

111
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:19,430
under me
but that's not going down

112
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
but that's not going down
 

113
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,589
but that's not going down
try both resistance against that pattern

114
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
try both resistance against that pattern
 

115
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,350
try both resistance against that pattern
which many of you have

116
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
which many of you have
 

117
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,949
which many of you have
tried so just

118
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
tried so just
 

119
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,990
tried so just
as if if i was strong enough to

120
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
as if if i was strong enough to
 

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,390
as if if i was strong enough to
take that line it's not the art

122
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
take that line it's not the art
 

123
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,869
take that line it's not the art
and even if i am strong enough so i'll

124
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
and even if i am strong enough so i'll
 

125
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,149
and even if i am strong enough so i'll
come over the camera to

126
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
come over the camera to
 

127
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,309
come over the camera to
see you and he has this point of like

128
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
see you and he has this point of like
 

129
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,390
see you and he has this point of like
and even if i'm strong enough with my

130
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
and even if i'm strong enough with my
 

131
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,789
and even if i'm strong enough with my
weight

132
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
weight
 

133
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,990
weight
it's not the r

134
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000

 

135
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,309

it's just big man aikido which means not

136
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
it's just big man aikido which means not
 

137
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,550
it's just big man aikido which means not
aikido

138
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
aikido
 

139
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,589
aikido
so if you look

140
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
so if you look
 

141
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,470
so if you look
the arm is not rotating so some things

142
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
the arm is not rotating so some things
 

143
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,750
the arm is not rotating so some things
to tell you if the elbow stays on top

144
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
to tell you if the elbow stays on top
 

145
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,190
to tell you if the elbow stays on top
then the cross is not rotating the elbow

146
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
then the cross is not rotating the elbow
 

147
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,190
then the cross is not rotating the elbow
has to keep going over

148
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200

 

149
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,509

also the elbow doesn't travel in a

150
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
also the elbow doesn't travel in a
 

151
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,949
also the elbow doesn't travel in a
straight line

152
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
straight line
 

153
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,110
straight line
it does go this way but it goes this way

154
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
it does go this way but it goes this way
 

155
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,030
it does go this way but it goes this way
in a spiral

156
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
in a spiral
 

157
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,830
in a spiral
so it goes this way

158
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840

 

159
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,110

so we'll look at something uh

160
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120

 

161
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,790

some cues if his elbow stays on top

162
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
some cues if his elbow stays on top
 

163
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,310
some cues if his elbow stays on top
i have the wrong line i'm not spiraling

164
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
i have the wrong line i'm not spiraling
 

165
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,550
i have the wrong line i'm not spiraling
the arm

166
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
the arm
 

167
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,070
the arm
if his body stays still

168
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
if his body stays still
 

169
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,790
if his body stays still
you see that's not it his body keeps

170
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
you see that's not it his body keeps
 

171
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,070
you see that's not it his body keeps
moving forward

172
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

173
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,070

so i'll show you let's get that leg

174
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
so i'll show you let's get that leg
 

175
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,430
so i'll show you let's get that leg
underneath me

176
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
underneath me
 

177
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,310
underneath me
you see it's not that i try to overpower

178
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
you see it's not that i try to overpower
 

179
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,189
you see it's not that i try to overpower
it

180
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
it
 

181
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,270
it
instead i'm going around this energy

182
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
instead i'm going around this energy
 

183
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,870

this post right here

184
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
this post right here
 

185
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,830
this post right here
and it will put him on the other post

186
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
and it will put him on the other post
 

187
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,390
and it will put him on the other post
you'll see

188
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400

 

189
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,670

now i want him to resist a second time

190
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
now i want him to resist a second time
 

191
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,790
now i want him to resist a second time
so when he resists here resist strong

192
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
so when he resists here resist strong
 

193
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,670
so when he resists here resist strong
this is what i get to take the other leg

194
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
this is what i get to take the other leg
 

195
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,270
this is what i get to take the other leg
okay

196
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
okay
 

197
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,310
okay
over here it's strong so i'm not going

198
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
over here it's strong so i'm not going
 

199
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,510
over here it's strong so i'm not going
against that leg

200
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
against that leg
 

201
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,189
against that leg
i'm going to take this over here and

202
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
i'm going to take this over here and
 

203
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,790
i'm going to take this over here and
point it down

204
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
point it down
 

205
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,029
point it down
then the other leg comes and now i

206
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
then the other leg comes and now i
 

207
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,070
then the other leg comes and now i
continue that

208
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
continue that
 

209
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,670
continue that
and you're going to see that i'm just

210
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
and you're going to see that i'm just
 

211
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,990
and you're going to see that i'm just
doing that over and over

212
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
doing that over and over
 

213
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,830
doing that over and over
and over again

214
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840

 

215
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,390

you're not going to see him stay still

boom and he's going to push up on my

boom and he's going to push up on my
 

281
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,469
boom and he's going to push up on my
ground vector

ground vector
 

283
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,950

and he's going to get a coq projection

284
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
and he's going to get a coq projection
 

285
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,589
and he's going to get a coq projection
down and then i just keep staying with

286
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
down and then i just keep staying with
 

287
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:17,909
down and then i just keep staying with
him

288
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
him
 

289
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,510
him
as he does that i'm not pushing him down

290
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
as he does that i'm not pushing him down
 

291
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,710
as he does that i'm not pushing him down
he just hits the the same projection

292
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
he just hits the the same projection
 

293
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,830
he just hits the the same projection
he's here

294
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
he's here
 

295
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,230
he's here
right we're here a lot of the technique

296
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
right we're here a lot of the technique
 

297
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,110
right we're here a lot of the technique
he's here

298
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
he's here
 

299
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,710
he's here
and he's gonna hit that same projection

300
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
and he's gonna hit that same projection
 

301
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,029
and he's gonna hit that same projection
of the ground he's gonna hit it on my

302
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
of the ground he's gonna hit it on my
 

303
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,950
of the ground he's gonna hit it on my
hands

304
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960

305
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,469

so i'm going off bring him into that

306
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
so i'm going off bring him into that
 

307
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,430
so i'm going off bring him into that
pattern

308
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
pattern
 

309
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,589

right there that's why it's like that

310
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
right there that's why it's like that
 

311
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,430
right there that's why it's like that
it's a boom

312
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
it's a boom
 

313
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,230
it's a boom
not the steady where you're lowering him

314
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
not the steady where you're lowering him
 

315
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,589
not the steady where you're lowering him
his resistance his will to come up

316
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
his resistance his will to come up
 

317
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,950
his resistance his will to come up
projects him down okay

318
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960

319
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,230

and i'm just staying as he keeps falling
 

323
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,150
and i'm just staying as he keeps falling
so i'm not shoving him down

324
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
so i'm not shoving him down
 

325
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:38,829
so i'm not shoving him down
he keeps resisting projecting
