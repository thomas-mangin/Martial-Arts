uh the center line you don't go outside

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
uh the center line you don't go outside
 

11
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
uh the center line you don't go outside
of the outer rim just to put it simply

12
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:17,900
of the outer rim just to put it simply
 

13
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,630
of the outer rim just to put it simply
uh you always start from point of origin

14
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
uh you always start from point of origin
 

15
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,390
uh you always start from point of origin
and you use economy in motion okay so

16
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:23,400
and you use economy in motion okay so
 

17
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,670
and you use economy in motion okay so
here we have I don't care so here I have

18
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,680
here we have I don't care so here I have
 

19
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,330
here we have I don't care so here I have
um

20
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,340
um
 

21
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,490
um
his weapon okay you're gonna strike at

22
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:31,500
his weapon okay you're gonna strike at
 

23
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,190
his weapon okay you're gonna strike at
my face okay so there it goes

24
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,200
my face okay so there it goes
 

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,330
my face okay so there it goes
do that side again slower one two

26
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340
do that side again slower one two
 

27
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,750
do that side again slower one two
so if you look at tessabaki one is my

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
so if you look at tessabaki one is my
 

29
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,910
so if you look at tessabaki one is my
other pair is my first Prairie then two

30
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
other pair is my first Prairie then two
 

31
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,889
other pair is my first Prairie then two
is the other hand

32
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:45,899
is the other hand
 

33
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,069
is the other hand
so it's the same punch again solar one

34
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
so it's the same punch again solar one
 

35
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,330
so it's the same punch again solar one
two

36
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:50,340
two
 

37
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,029
two
but now we have to adhere okay same side

38
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
but now we have to adhere okay same side
 

39
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,270
but now we have to adhere okay same side
again so it's one two and we're stuck

40
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
again so it's one two and we're stuck
 

41
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,130
again so it's one two and we're stuck
here that's what I'm looking for I'm

42
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,140
here that's what I'm looking for I'm
 

43
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,590
here that's what I'm looking for I'm
looking for in Center so you can project

44
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
looking for in Center so you can project
 

45
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,009
looking for in Center so you can project
that way but obeying yin yang I'll take

46
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:04,019
that way but obeying yin yang I'll take
 

47
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:15,580
that way but obeying yin yang I'll take
the scapula

I don't want you to discount it okay so
 

59
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,990
I don't want you to discount it okay so
uh for example

60
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000

 

61
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,830

he does the same punch

62
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
he does the same punch
 

63
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,350
he does the same punch
and you can shove him into the wall and

64
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
and you can shove him into the wall and
 

65
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,330
and you can shove him into the wall and
now you're attacking the back okay or

66
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
now you're attacking the back okay or
 

67
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,490

you can shove them into anyone else but
I'm just using this mechanically

70
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:46,259
I'm just using this mechanically
 

71
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,710
I'm just using this mechanically
to understand hands go from point of

72
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
to understand hands go from point of
 

73
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,770
to understand hands go from point of
origin and I'm stuck right there

74
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:51,780
origin and I'm stuck right there
 

75
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,410
origin and I'm stuck right there
hands point of origin stop

76
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,420
hands point of origin stop
 

77
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,929
hands point of origin stop
and then projecting out okay that's what

78
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
and then projecting out okay that's what
 

79
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,310
and then projecting out okay that's what
we're working on

80
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
we're working on
 

81
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,069
we're working on
so now go ahead

82
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:01,079
so now go ahead
 

83
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,630
so now go ahead
now if I have that uh adhesion there it

84
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
now if I have that uh adhesion there it
 

85
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,330
now if I have that uh adhesion there it
gives go ahead it gives a slight little

86
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,340
gives go ahead it gives a slight little
 

87
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,969
gives go ahead it gives a slight little
acceleration you see as I use it to the

88
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:10,979
acceleration you see as I use it to the
 

89
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,309
acceleration you see as I use it to the
end of its yawn face

90
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,319
end of its yawn face
 

91
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,630
end of its yawn face
so now I don't have to just push

92
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
so now I don't have to just push
 

93
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,270
so now I don't have to just push
I can use it to generate opposing forces

94
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
I can use it to generate opposing forces
 

95
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,510
I can use it to generate opposing forces
into the knee strike okay as opposed to

increase force and impact on the knee
 

105
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,210
increase force and impact on the knee
strike and I also make sure his Center

106
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,220
strike and I also make sure his Center
 

107
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,910
strike and I also make sure his Center
is committed to the angle of attack of

here
 

199
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,330
here
the other hand is going to cover load

200
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,340
the other hand is going to cover load
 

201
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,029
the other hand is going to cover load
you see and then when it goes up the the

202
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
you see and then when it goes up the the
 

203
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,890
you see and then when it goes up the the
ham in this case I would go to the back

204
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:36,900
ham in this case I would go to the back
 

205
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,290
ham in this case I would go to the back
you see

206
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,300
you see
 

207
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,330
you see
but you're always going to have your

208
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
but you're always going to have your
 

209
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,610
but you're always going to have your
outer rim covered in some sort of high

210
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:43,620
outer rim covered in some sort of high
 

211
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,710
outer rim covered in some sort of high
low and that's where the trapping comes

212
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:45,720
low and that's where the trapping comes
 

213
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,650
low and that's where the trapping comes
in okay so as he goes go slow so I can

214
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:48,660
in okay so as he goes go slow so I can
 

215
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,730
in okay so as he goes go slow so I can
talk okay so boom when this ends here

216
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,740
talk okay so boom when this ends here
 

217
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,090
talk okay so boom when this ends here
this hand should drop okay protecting

218
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,100
this hand should drop okay protecting
 

219
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,310
this hand should drop okay protecting
against that leg

220
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320

 

221
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,230

you can't even hit with it before your

222
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
you can't even hit with it before your
 

223
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,510
you can't even hit with it before your
knee right but my hand will be low

224
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
knee right but my hand will be low
 

225
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,790
knee right but my hand will be low
because the other hand is high and I'm

226
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,800
because the other hand is high and I'm
 

227
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,670
because the other hand is high and I'm
not in the back it's just automatic what

228

my opening triangles of the high low
 

249
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,809
my opening triangles of the high low
will trap do you see

250
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:44,819
