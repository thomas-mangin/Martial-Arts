doing is taking that center of gravity
 

383
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,949
doing is taking that center of gravity
and projecting it so the line you drive

384
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:31,959
and projecting it so the line you drive
 

385
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:39,679

you throw a rock you understand it you
 

399
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:20,900
you throw a rock you understand it you
do ballistic or fixated so

400
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:20,910

 

401
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,850

you guys got it okay so it's not magic

402
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:24,860
you guys got it okay so it's not magic

material like I'm trying to explain to

408
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,260
material like I'm trying to explain to
 

409
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,310
material like I'm trying to explain to
you what red is but you've never seen a

410
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
you what red is but you've never seen a
 

411
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,460
you what red is but you've never seen a
color before right how am I going to

412
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,470
color before right how am I going to
 

413
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,970
color before right how am I going to
explain that to you and we have a lot of

414
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:46,980
explain that to you and we have a lot of
 

415
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,370
explain that to you and we have a lot of
source material that makes us go from

416
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,380
source material that makes us go from
 

417
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,050
source material that makes us go from
one meaning to the other meaning

418

one meaning to the other meaning
 

419
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,100
one meaning to the other meaning
so and every time you don't have the

420
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,110
so and every time you don't have the
 

421
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,320
so and every time you don't have the
source material then you provide the

422
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,330
source material then you provide the
 

423
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,990
source material then you provide the
source material and it comes from a

424
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
source material and it comes from a
 

425
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,090
source material and it comes from a
place of ignorance so it's probably not

426
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,100
place of ignorance so it's probably not
 

427
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,480
place of ignorance so it's probably not
going to be it okay so none of this is

428
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,490
going to be it okay so none of this is
 

429
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,960
going to be it okay so none of this is
really quite accurate this is just in

milk it now that this is just deception
 

447
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,660
milk it now that this is just deception
and now become self-deception okay so

milking you're gonna milk this row so
 

463
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,170
milking you're gonna milk this row so
you will be done yet so already there's

464
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,180
you will be done yet so already there's
 

465
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,530
you will be done yet so already there's
a bracing angle can you see it and she's

elbow tilted here okay now what does

470
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,110
elbow tilted here okay now what does
 

471
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,160
elbow tilted here okay now what does
that elbow doing for you you're trying

472
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,170
that elbow doing for you you're trying
 

473
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,390
that elbow doing for you you're trying
to do something with it what keep him

474
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
to do something with it what keep him
 

475
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,030
to do something with it what keep him
out okay so he's keep that elbow there

476
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,040
out okay so he's keep that elbow there
 

477
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,460
out okay so he's keep that elbow there
please move and let's apply force and

478
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:31,470
please move and let's apply force and
 

479
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,740
please move and let's apply force and
see if it actually works

480
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,750
see if it actually works
 

481
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,710
see if it actually works
you see that let's back in

okay wait so you you have this arch get
 

487
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,490
okay wait so you you have this arch get
it up and get mid-foot not heal and

488
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:58,500
it up and get mid-foot not heal and
 

489
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,710
it up and get mid-foot not heal and
you're a little bit too Ike you know

this arm you're doing this same thing is
you're trying to hook hip and so you

498
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
you're trying to hook hip and so you
 

499
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,640
you're trying to hook hip and so you
have warp in do you see that and so this

500
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:19,650
have warp in do you see that and so this
 

501
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,770
have warp in do you see that and so this
is bicep you can feel it

502
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:21,780
is bicep you can feel it
 

503
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,630

so extend right and relax you don't need
 

505
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,210
so extend right and relax you don't need
a hook to have contact okay then release

506
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,220
a hook to have contact okay then release
 

507
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,200

on okay let's go we're trying to use

550
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:03,700
on okay let's go we're trying to use
 

551
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,100
on okay let's go we're trying to use
this micro drilling to get them really

we just want that heal okay so when he

556
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:16,809
we just want that heal okay so when he
 

557
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,889
we just want that heal okay so when he
goes to push you see I make that shape

558
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:19,899
goes to push you see I make that shape
 

559
