20
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
to try and do it wrong
 

21
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,630
to try and do it wrong
this arm where is if i took my knee away

22
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
this arm where is if i took my knee away
 

23
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,710
this arm where is if i took my knee away
it would fall down there because i'm

24
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
it would fall down there because i'm
 

25
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,630
it would fall down there because i'm
going to make a space with my knee what

26
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
going to make a space with my knee what
 

27
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,150
going to make a space with my knee what
a lot of people try and do is they take

28
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
a lot of people try and do is they take
 

29
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,990
a lot of people try and do is they take
an airway

30
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
an airway
 

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
an airway
and they move the

32
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
and they move the
 

33
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,870
and they move the
the hand

34
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
the hand
 

35
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,630
the hand
like the hand sticks to it and they go

36
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
like the hand sticks to it and they go
 

37
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,110
like the hand sticks to it and they go
like that if you do that

38
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
like that if you do that
 

39
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,549
like that if you do that
the other hand is pinned to the other

40
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
the other hand is pinned to the other
 

41
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,110
the other hand is pinned to the other
knee so i can't get it over to do

42
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
knee so i can't get it over to do
 

43
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,549
knee so i can't get it over to do
anything else

44
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559

 

45
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,709

the intent a little bit easier the

46
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
the intent a little bit easier the
 

47
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,830
the intent a little bit easier the
intention is as i take the knee away

48
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
intention is as i take the knee away
 

49
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,389
intention is as i take the knee away
to come on top of that wrist drop it

50
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
to come on top of that wrist drop it
 

51
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,430
to come on top of that wrist drop it
down

52
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
down
 

53
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,950
down
roll it

54
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
roll it
 

55
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,189
roll it
like i'm rolling a rolling pin

56
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
like i'm rolling a rolling pin
 

57
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,910
like i'm rolling a rolling pin
so this is a lot this is why again i

58
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
so this is a lot this is why again i
 

59
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,590
so this is a lot this is why again i
like psytosensei because his logic works

60
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
like psytosensei because his logic works
 

61
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,469
like psytosensei because his logic works
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking

62
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking
 

63
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,070
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking
it further away

64
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
it further away
 

65
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,109
it further away
from my hands to get it

66
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
from my hands to get it
 

67
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,550
from my hands to get it
so logic tells you why would you do that

68
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
so logic tells you why would you do that
 

69
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
so logic tells you why would you do that
you actually need it to be closer rather

70
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
you actually need it to be closer rather
 

71
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,870
you actually need it to be closer rather
than further away

72
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
than further away
 

73
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,950
than further away
so this is another don't go backwards to

74
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
so this is another don't go backwards to
 

75
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,070
so this is another don't go backwards to
go forwards because if you're going to

76
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
go forwards because if you're going to
 

77
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,149
go forwards because if you're going to
go all that way to there you might not

78
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
go all that way to there you might not
 

79
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,390
go all that way to there you might not
make it

80
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
make it
 

81
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,630
make it
so you're all going to not all of you

82
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
so you're all going to not all of you
 

83
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,109
so you're all going to not all of you
but most of you're going to do it wrong

84
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
but most of you're going to do it wrong
 

85
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,469
but most of you're going to do it wrong
because that's

86
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
because that's
 

87
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,910
because that's
how we are

88
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
how we are
 

89
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,749
how we are
we don't quite get the timeline you've

90
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
we don't quite get the timeline you've
 

91
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,429
we don't quite get the timeline you've
got to take the foot away

92
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
got to take the foot away
 

93
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,510
got to take the foot away
that leg away

94
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
that leg away
 

95
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,950
that leg away
turn that hand down there

96
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
turn that hand down there
 

97
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,550
turn that hand down there
and instead of doing that

98
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
and instead of doing that
 

99
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,030
and instead of doing that
you see are we getting we got getting

100
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
you see are we getting we got getting
 

101
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:01,670
you see are we getting we got getting
the message now about this

102
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680

 

103
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,910

all right

104
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920

 

105
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,190

so it should if it doesn't

106
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
so it should if it doesn't
 

107
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,710
so it should if it doesn't
you know they're machines when you go

108
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
you know they're machines when you go
 

109
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,350
you know they're machines when you go
abroad and use you to go a fresh orange

110

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
juice they put on the machine it either
 

113
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,430

squashes it or there's a fancy one that

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
squashes it or there's a fancy one that
 

115
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,270

just takes the peel off

116
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
just takes the peel off

so this doesn't really much need to be

126
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
so this doesn't really much need to be
 

127
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,990
so this doesn't really much need to be
in there

128
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000

129
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,229
in there
and a very dear friend of mine and uh

130
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
and a very dear friend of mine and uh

sensei that's not here anymore tim
this was his

134
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
this was his
 

135
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,910
this was his
about 100

136
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
about 100
 

137
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,229
about 100
favorite technique

138
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
favorite technique
 

139
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,670
favorite technique
so

140
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
so
 

141
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,070
so
it turns

142
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
it turns
 

143
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,270
it turns
goes down

144
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
goes down
 

145
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,390
goes down
or else you're going to hurt your own

146
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
or else you're going to hurt your own
 

147
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,430
or else you're going to hurt your own
hand this one at the same time would

148
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
hand this one at the same time would
 

149
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,430
hand this one at the same time would
have been on top of that and there's a

150
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
have been on top of that and there's a
 

151
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,910
have been on top of that and there's a
small gap here and that last part

152
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
small gap here and that last part
 

153
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,869
small gap here and that last part
rolls him down

154
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879

 

155
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,589

so this is that piece of cake that you

156
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
so this is that piece of cake that you
 

157
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,470
so this is that piece of cake that you
you all had out of the cake

158
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
you all had out of the cake
 

159
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,149
you all had out of the cake
all right this is the things you need so

160
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
all right this is the things you need so
 

161
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,910
all right this is the things you need so
it's

162
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
it's
 

163
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,589
it's
so you don't really need this but if you

164
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
so you don't really need this but if you
 

165
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,110
so you don't really need this but if you
do

166
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
do
 

167
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,830
do
you roll them away you don't push them

168
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
you roll them away you don't push them
 

169
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,470
you roll them away you don't push them
away you roll them away

170
