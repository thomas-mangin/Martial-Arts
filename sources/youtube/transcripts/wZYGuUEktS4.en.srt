the cross lateral shoulder
this is going to check his legs enough

50
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
this is going to check his legs enough
 

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,109
this is going to check his legs enough
for you to move

just some marshall points

72
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
just some marshall points
 

73
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,709
just some marshall points
so when i step here to the right

74
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
so when i step here to the right
 

75
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,429
so when i step here to the right
the angle of deflection has to go to my

76
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
the angle of deflection has to go to my
 

77
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:01,990
the angle of deflection has to go to my
left

78
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000

79
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,630

so he comes in second point

80
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
so he comes in second point
 

81
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,949
so he comes in second point
when i'm on the outside of the arm i got

82
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
when i'm on the outside of the arm i got
 

83
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,790
when i'm on the outside of the arm i got
to be

84
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
to be
 

85
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,070
to be
in the elbow area i don't want to be

86
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
in the elbow area i don't want to be
 

87
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,670
in the elbow area i don't want to be
down at the hand that's

88
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
down at the hand that's
 

89
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,790
down at the hand that's
your aikido wet drink so you take his

90
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
your aikido wet drink so you take his
 

91
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,510
your aikido wet drink so you take his
hand

92
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
hand
 

93
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,630
hand
and then he follows

94
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640

 

95
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,390

you have to guard against him overriding

96
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
you have to guard against him overriding
 

97
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,110
you have to guard against him overriding
my

98
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
my
 

99
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,509
my
angle of deflection so i push the wrist

100
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
angle of deflection so i push the wrist
 

101
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,470
angle of deflection so i push the wrist
he'll use his elbow to go around it

102
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480

 

103
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,110

so when you're on the outside you have

104
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
so when you're on the outside you have
 

105
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,830
so when you're on the outside you have
to be

106
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
to be
 

107
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,190
to be
in this elbow area so when he goes to do

108
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
in this elbow area so when he goes to do
 

109
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,430
in this elbow area so when he goes to do
any of his stuff you still have control

110
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
any of his stuff you still have control
 

111
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,229
any of his stuff you still have control
of that joint

112
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
of that joint
 

113
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,390
of that joint
so when you're out here the my is gonna

114
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
so when you're out here the my is gonna
 

115
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,630
so when you're out here the my is gonna
be off it's what you're experiencing but

116
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
be off it's what you're experiencing but
 

117
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470
be off it's what you're experiencing but
you think it's fine because you're

00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
in dreamland so when we're here like
 

121
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,470
in dreamland so when we're here like
this

122
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
this
 

123
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,070
this
i'm engaging that elbow

124
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
i'm engaging that elbow
 

125
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,990
i'm engaging that elbow
and that elbow is going in

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000

 

127
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,910

just like the keyhole

so the first move the elbow goes in

so the first move the elbow goes in
 

137
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,550
so the first move the elbow goes in
that gets his center of gravity starting

that gets his center of gravity starting
 

139
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,350
that gets his center of gravity starting
to move

140
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
to move
 

141
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,830
to move
and the fight starts to rotate we're now
