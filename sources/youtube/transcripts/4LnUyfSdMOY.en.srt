00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:22,760
cross again okay and I'm going to

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,630
cross again okay and I'm going to
demonstrate it by several means here

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
demonstrate it by several means here
 

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,349
demonstrate it by several means here
okay and it is going to require

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
okay and it is going to require
 

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,670
okay and it is going to require
that UK has to learn to rule differently

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:34,680
that UK has to learn to rule differently
 

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,790
that UK has to learn to rule differently

00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,280
throw um we're
 

25
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,910
throw um we're
doing the same thing we always do with

26
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:48,920
doing the same thing we always do with
 

27
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,709
doing the same thing we always do with
this cross which is to

28
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719

 

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,709

deconstruct UK's ability to remain

30
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
deconstruct UK's ability to remain
 

31
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,910
deconstruct UK's ability to remain
upright so that gravity can work upon

32
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
upright so that gravity can work upon
 

33
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,750

him
 

35
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,950
him
and then that way we are throwing UK UK

36
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,960
and then that way we are throwing UK UK
 

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,870
and then that way we are throwing UK UK

to um undo their own base of support

40
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,320
to um undo their own base of support
 

41
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,310

their own equilibrium Etc we are
 

43
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,510
their own equilibrium Etc we are
deconstructing the elements necessary

44
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,520
deconstructing the elements necessary
 

45
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,510
deconstructing the elements necessary
for them to remain upright and hence we

46
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
for them to remain upright and hence we
 

47
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,510
for them to remain upright and hence we
are throwing them okay as I've discussed

48
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
are throwing them okay as I've discussed
 

49
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,670
are throwing them okay as I've discussed
with uh some

50
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
with uh some
 

51
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,670

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,230
people
um even though most today feel like

54
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
um even though most today feel like
 

55
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,350
um even though most today feel like
they've been

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,360
they've been
 

57
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,710
they've been
thrown uh they they haven't been because

58
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,720
thrown uh they they haven't been because
 

59
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,510
thrown uh they they haven't been because
they've never had this base of

they've never had this base of

deconstructed and so they always have
 

65
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,749

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,030
some sense of

74
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039
UK uh you're going to freak the hell out
 

75
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,469
UK uh you're going to freak the hell out
of them because it's Pro is the first

of them because it's Pro is the first
 

77
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,029
of them because it's Pro is the first

okay there is a spiritual reason for why

80
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
okay there is a spiritual reason for why
 

81
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,630
okay there is a spiritual reason for why
we deconstruct this space of support so

82
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
we deconstruct this space of support so
 

83
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,630
we deconstruct this space of support so
of course obviously there's an easy to

of course obviously there's an easy to

today we're going to take

126
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
today we're going to take
 

127
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,509
today we're going to take
off the spiritual aspect but just be

128
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519
off the spiritual aspect but just be
 

129
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,589
off the spiritual aspect but just be
aware of it when you throw your UK like

130
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:16,599
aware of it when you throw your UK like
 

131
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,750
aware of it when you throw your UK like
this for the first time they're going to

132
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:18,760
this for the first time they're going to
 

133
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,789
this for the first time they're going to
freak

134
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:19,799
freak
 

135
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,869
freak
out uh they're not going to like

136
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
out uh they're not going to like
 

137
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,589
out uh they're not going to like
it and then we're going to take off the

138
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
it and then we're going to take off the
 

139
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,710
it and then we're going to take off the
energetic aspect as well uh so that we

140
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
energetic aspect as well uh so that we
 

141
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,070
energetic aspect as well uh so that we
just understand it physically

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,670
okay if you
have um in simple terms let's say this

UK and they're going to be taken into
 

151
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,789

one is somewhere I don't know somewhere
 

211
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,390
one is somewhere I don't know somewhere
in this region okay and it's not too far

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
in this region okay and it's not too far
 

213
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,909
in this region okay and it's not too far
outside of the spine so if nag is over

214
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
outside of the spine so if nag is over
 

215
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,230
outside of the spine so if nag is over
here the foot is somewhere around here

216
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,240
here the foot is somewhere around here
 

217
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,990
here the foot is somewhere around here
okay

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
okay
 

219
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,710
okay
so let's return to basic angle of

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,720
so let's return to basic angle of
 

221
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,150
so let's return to basic angle of
disturbance Concepts okay so we have to

222
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,160
disturbance Concepts okay so we have to
 

223
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,590
disturbance Concepts okay so we have to
know the line of

support UK will have balance we'll have
 

247
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,029
support UK will have balance we'll have
it's it's going to be a dynamic

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
it's it's going to be a dynamic
 

249
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,070
it's it's going to be a dynamic
equilibrium but it's equilibrium

251
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,230

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,240
nonetheless and I would put before you
 

253
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,070

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
the there is no equilibrium that is not
 

255
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,550
the there is no equilibrium that is not
a dynamic equilibrium for human beings

okay basis support is that foot only in

258
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:38,919
okay basis support is that foot only in
 

259
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,270
okay basis support is that foot only in
this case Okay so if that line of

260
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
this case Okay so if that line of
 

261
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,710
this case Okay so if that line of
gravity is over that foot UK is going to

262
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,720
gravity is over that foot UK is going to
 

263
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,950
gravity is over that foot UK is going to
have a sense of control and they can

264
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:47,960
have a sense of control and they can
 

265
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,230
have a sense of control and they can
decide how they want to roll when they

266
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
decide how they want to roll when they
 

267
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,589
decide how they want to roll when they
want to roll ultimately okay what we're

268
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
want to roll ultimately okay what we're
 

269
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,749
want to roll ultimately okay what we're
going to do instead is we're going to

270
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:56,759
going to do instead is we're going to
 

271
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,070
going to do instead is we're going to
send uh this thing one way

272
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
send uh this thing one way
 

273
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,790
send uh this thing one way
and this thing another way so that the

274
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
and this thing another way so that the
 

275
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,230
and this thing another way so that the
line of gravity is going to be outside

276
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
line of gravity is going to be outside
 

277
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,830
line of gravity is going to be outside
the base of

278
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
the base of
 

279
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,270
the base of
support and the base of support can

280
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
support and the base of support can
 

281
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,150
support and the base of support can
never be put back underneath that line

282
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,160
never be put back underneath that line
 

283
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,390
never be put back underneath that line
of gravity that is what I mean by

284
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,400
of gravity that is what I mean by
 

285
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,469
of gravity that is what I mean by
deconstructing balance here

286
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479

 

287
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,150

okay I'll show you what that what that

288
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,160
okay I'll show you what that what that
 

289
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,909
okay I'll show you what that what that
looks like now spec with specifics okay

290
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
looks like now spec with specifics okay
 

291
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,230
looks like now spec with specifics okay
okay so if we look at

292
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
okay so if we look at
 

293
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,309
okay so if we look at
yesterday we in those variations of

294
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:35,319
yesterday we in those variations of
 

295
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,869
yesterday we in those variations of
kiten n uh UK was in that three-point

296
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:38,879
kiten n uh UK was in that three-point
 

297
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,869
kiten n uh UK was in that three-point
stance so go ahead and go back into that

298
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:40,879
stance so go ahead and go back into that
 

299
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,110
stance so go ahead and go back into that
three-point

300
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
three-point
 

301
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,830
three-point
stance okay and you can put your hand on

302
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:44,840
stance okay and you can put your hand on
 

303
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,189
stance okay and you can put your hand on
the ground cuz you would have that

304
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
the ground cuz you would have that
 

305
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,309
the ground cuz you would have that
available okay and so his base of

306
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:49,319
available okay and so his base of
 

307
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,909
available okay and so his base of
support let me identify it it's going to

308
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
support let me identify it it's going to
 

309
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,350
support let me identify it it's going to
be this

310
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
be this
 

311
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,550
be this
hand this

312
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
hand this
 

313
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,629
hand this
foot that foot and then all the AR area

314
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
foot that foot and then all the AR area
 

315
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,390
foot that foot and then all the AR area
shaded

316
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,400
shaded
 

317
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,990
shaded
in and then you'd find his center of

318
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
in and then you'd find his center of
 

319
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,390
in and then you'd find his center of
gravity it's probably somewhere around

320
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
gravity it's probably somewhere around
 

321
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,950
gravity it's probably somewhere around
here in the middle of his body and then

322
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:09,960
here in the middle of his body and then
 

323
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,070
here in the middle of his body and then
the line of gravity would

324
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,080
the line of gravity would
 

325
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,670
the line of gravity would
travel theoretically down through that

326
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
travel theoretically down through that
 

327
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,790
travel theoretically down through that
Center

328
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:17,800
Center
 

329
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,670
Center
gravity and you would find I'll I'll

330
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:20,680
gravity and you would find I'll I'll
 

331
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,550
gravity and you would find I'll I'll
I'll kind of superimpose

332
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:23,560
I'll kind of superimpose
 

333
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,469
I'll kind of superimpose
this but it's here that it's inside his

334
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
this but it's here that it's inside his
 

335
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,430
this but it's here that it's inside his
basis support and hence remains balanced

336
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440

 

337

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,990
happens to
him when we add

502
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,000
him when we add
 

503
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,269
him when we add
our

504
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
our
 

505
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,870
our
adhesion and we're moving his head this

506
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
adhesion and we're moving his head this
 

507
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,910
adhesion and we're moving his head this
way

508
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:30,920

 

509
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,389

that's going to

510
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
that's going to
 

511
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,189
that's going to
accentuate that Co projection and the

512
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,199
accentuate that Co projection and the
 

513
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,150
accentuate that Co projection and the
displacement of this line of gravity

514
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
displacement of this line of gravity
 

515
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,189
displacement of this line of gravity
outside so I'll just do a force Vector

516
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:41,199
outside so I'll just do a force Vector
 

517
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,150
outside so I'll just do a force Vector
pulling in and a force

518
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
pulling in and a force
 

519
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,069
pulling in and a force
Vector pushing out and this happens much

520
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:51,079

 

521
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,750

sooner when you do the CQ projection so

522
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:54,760
sooner when you do the CQ projection so
 

523
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,389
sooner when you do the CQ projection so
these were just mechanical

524
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
these were just mechanical
 

525
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,629
these were just mechanical
representations of the force lines when

526
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
representations of the force lines when
 

527
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,790
representations of the force lines when
you you do a CQ projection his Center

528
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
you you do a CQ projection his Center
 

529
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,750
you you do a CQ projection his Center
boom goes completely outside of that leg

530
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
boom goes completely outside of that leg
 

531
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,389
boom goes completely outside of that leg
and it's more something like

532
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:09,399
and it's more something like
 

533
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,069
and it's more something like
this and now that I projected his Center

534
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:13,079
this and now that I projected his Center
 

535
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,470
this and now that I projected his Center
outside of that Bas of support usually

536
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,480
outside of that Bas of support usually
 

537
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,550
outside of that Bas of support usually
it's about 6 in to anywhere up to 2 feet

538
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
it's about 6 in to anywhere up to 2 feet
 

539
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,629
it's about 6 in to anywhere up to 2 feet
if I feel like it if anyone feels like

540
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:21,639
if I feel like it if anyone feels like
 

541
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,269
if I feel like it if anyone feels like
it okay there's no way he can get that

542
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:24,279
it okay there's no way he can get that
 

543
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,710
it okay there's no way he can get that
foot back underneath that line of

544
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
foot back underneath that line of
 

545
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,870
foot back underneath that line of
gravity and this is what guarantees that

546
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
gravity and this is what guarantees that
 

547
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,590
gravity and this is what guarantees that
I'm throwing him and he doesn't get a

548
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm throwing him and he doesn't get a
 

549
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,590
I'm throwing him and he doesn't get a
choice his only choice again is how does

550
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
choice his only choice again is how does
 

551
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,550
choice his only choice again is how does
he land that's his only choice okay back

552
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,560
he land that's his only choice okay back
 

553
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,150
he land that's his only choice okay back
to that spiritual

554
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,160
to that spiritual
 

555
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,389
to that spiritual
component and you don't even know how to

556
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:41,399
component and you don't even know how to
 

557
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,670
component and you don't even know how to
do this so you're going to have to

558
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:42,680
do this so you're going to have to
 

559
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,470
do this so you're going to have to
listen to me okay you're going to have

560
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,480
listen to me okay you're going to have
 

561
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,870
listen to me okay you're going to have
to roll like the iy1 kids where they

562
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
to roll like the iy1 kids where they
 

563
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,750
to roll like the iy1 kids where they
kind of do a somersault going straight

564
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
kind of do a somersault going straight
 

565
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,590
kind of do a somersault going straight
ahead and in that direction yeah can I

566
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:52,600
ahead and in that direction yeah can I
 

567
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,670
ahead and in that direction yeah can I
can I see if you can even do that just

568
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:54,680
can I see if you can even do that just
 

569
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,749
can I see if you can even do that just
do a roll Straight Ahead okay there we

570
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:57,759
do a roll Straight Ahead okay there we
 

571
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,350
do a roll Straight Ahead okay there we
go

572
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:00,360
go
 

573
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,509
go
so in our Dojo that's incorrect because

574
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:02,519
so in our Dojo that's incorrect because
 

575
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,350
so in our Dojo that's incorrect because
he'll he'll never be able to roll that

576
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,360
he'll he'll never be able to roll that
 

577
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,269
he'll he'll never be able to roll that
way okay that makes sense if I

578
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
way okay that makes sense if I
 

579
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,550
way okay that makes sense if I
accelerate them that way then that rule

580
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:09,560
accelerate them that way then that rule
 

581
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,389
accelerate them that way then that rule
makes perfect

582
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399

 

583
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,749

sense but that's not what I'm

584
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:16,759

 

585
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,509

doing okay so you're going to try to do

586
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:20,519
doing okay so you're going to try to do
 

587
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,069
doing okay so you're going to try to do
that got it and give them some room

588
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
that got it and give them some room
 

589
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,870
that got it and give them some room
there I don't know where you want to be

590
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:25,880
there I don't know where you want to be
 

591
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,150
there I don't know where you want to be
okay but I'm going to push and pull and

592
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
okay but I'm going to push and pull and
 

593
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,269
okay but I'm going to push and pull and
you're going to try try to do your

594
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
you're going to try try to do your
 

595
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,230
you're going to try try to do your
forward

596
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240

 

597
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,870

roll it's impossible okay you see that

598
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
roll it's impossible okay you see that
 

599
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,269
roll it's impossible okay you see that
okay you're not going to be able to do

600
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279
okay you're not going to be able to do
 

601
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:46,790
okay you're not going to be able to do
that

602
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800

 

603
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,990

okay and we we'll demonstrate it again

604
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
okay and we we'll demonstrate it again
 

605
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,990
okay and we we'll demonstrate it again
um let's uh let's see if you could get

606
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
um let's uh let's see if you could get
 

607
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,629
um let's uh let's see if you could get
your foot under under under back

608
00:14:59,629 --> 00:14:59,639
your foot under under under back
 

609
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,389
your foot under under under back
underneath you so I'm going to send you

610
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:01,399
underneath you so I'm going to send you
 

611
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,949
underneath you so I'm going to send you
that way use all your ath athleticism to

612
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
that way use all your ath athleticism to
 

613
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,189
that way use all your ath athleticism to
just get your base back underneath you

614
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
just get your base back underneath you
 

615
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,230
just get your base back underneath you
okay good and now this is why you have

616
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
okay good and now this is why you have
 

617
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,670
okay good and now this is why you have
to do both so when I hold his head and

618
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
to do both so when I hold his head and
 

619
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,550
to do both so when I hold his head and
and I and I push

620
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
and I and I push
 

621
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,949
and I and I push
here much harder for him to do okay and

622
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
here much harder for him to do okay and
 

623
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,870
here much harder for him to do okay and
then as you're able to project that line

624
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:25,880
then as you're able to project that line
 

625
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,470
then as you're able to project that line
of Gravity by projecting his Hut up

626
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,480
of Gravity by projecting his Hut up
 

627
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,710
of Gravity by projecting his Hut up
completely out there it becomes pretty

628
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
completely out there it becomes pretty
 

629
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,150
completely out there it becomes pretty
much impossible for most I'm sure

630
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
much impossible for most I'm sure
 

631
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,670
much impossible for most I'm sure
there's a person out there that could do

632
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
there's a person out there that could do
 

633
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,590
there's a person out there that could do
it but it becomes pretty impossible so

634
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:40,600
it but it becomes pretty impossible so
 

635
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,150
it but it becomes pretty impossible so
you're going to do that same thing where

636
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
you're going to do that same thing where
 

637
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,910
you're going to do that same thing where
you get cool and you're

638
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
you get cool and you're
 

639
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,550
you get cool and you're
here can't do it okay and that's what

640
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
here can't do it okay and that's what
 

641
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,150
here can't do it okay and that's what
we're trying to achieve

642
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,160

 

643
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,990

okay all right we'll take that into a

644
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
okay all right we'll take that into a
 

645
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,509
okay all right we'll take that into a
key

646
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
key
 

647
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,430
key
uh one thing I never do is for example

648
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
uh one thing I never do is for example
 

649
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,509
uh one thing I never do is for example
in the uh common ones is UK I don't know

650
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
in the uh common ones is UK I don't know
 

651
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,309
in the uh common ones is UK I don't know
it's supposed to be going that way but

652
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:09,319
it's supposed to be going that way but
 

653
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,590
it's supposed to be going that way but
usually people stop right so there's no

654
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
usually people stop right so there's no
 

655
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,590
usually people stop right so there's no
spinal displacement but at some point

656
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:14,600
spinal displacement but at some point
 

657
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,269
spinal displacement but at some point
and if I was able to do this and we saw

658
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
and if I was able to do this and we saw
 

659
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,189
and if I was able to do this and we saw
last night I'm not able to do this so UK

660
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:20,199
last night I'm not able to do this so UK
 

661
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,470
last night I'm not able to do this so UK
goes with

662
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,480
goes with
 

663
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,389
goes with
me well energy is now going that way so

664
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:25,399
me well energy is now going that way so
 

665
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,590
me well energy is now going that way so
now I'm going against the energy Okay so

666
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:28,600
now I'm going against the energy Okay so
 

667
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,430
now I'm going against the energy Okay so
I don't do that version

668
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,440
I don't do that version
 

669
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,710
I don't do that version
anymore as some of you know from my

670
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
anymore as some of you know from my
 

671
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,269
anymore as some of you know from my
lineage cha Sensei did do that that

672
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:36,279
lineage cha Sensei did do that that
 

673
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,629
lineage cha Sensei did do that that
version but it doesn't make sense

674
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
version but it doesn't make sense
 

675
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,430
version but it doesn't make sense
energetically nor martially either

676
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:42,440
energetically nor martially either
 

677
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,230
energetically nor martially either
okay so I want you to look at something

678
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
okay so I want you to look at something
 

679
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,670
okay so I want you to look at something
that showed up yesterday when you pin

680
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
that showed up yesterday when you pin
 

681
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,990
that showed up yesterday when you pin
that

682
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
that
 

683
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,749
that
foot we show that he could not step on

684
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:54,759
foot we show that he could not step on
 

685
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,949
foot we show that he could not step on
that foot that foot gets

686
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
that foot that foot gets
 

687
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,949
that foot that foot gets
planted but do due to the inertia that

688
00:16:59,949 --> 00:16:59,959
planted but do due to the inertia that
 

689
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,069
planted but do due to the inertia that
keep kept going the other leg stepped

690
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,079
keep kept going the other leg stepped
 

691
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,390
keep kept going the other leg stepped
through so that's what we're going to do

692
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,400
through so that's what we're going to do
 

693
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,189
through so that's what we're going to do
here eventually he he's going to reach

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,630
he's going to reach to grab
okay slower and when he reaches to grab

700
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
okay slower and when he reaches to grab
 

701
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,350
okay slower and when he reaches to grab
I lower that and I let that foot come

702
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
I lower that and I let that foot come
 

703
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,150
I lower that and I let that foot come

move him around his shoulder passes me
and then the inward spiral will come

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,750
what wasn't all right so um stand by
okay so you're are you're at where

768
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:26,760
okay so you're are you're at where
 

769
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,710
okay so you're are you're at where
you're at and there's nothing wrong that

770
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
you're at and there's nothing wrong that
 

771
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,549
you're at and there's nothing wrong that
you're in the right place to stop being

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
you're in the right place to stop being
 

773
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,710
you're in the right place to stop being

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
where you're at okay but I I want to
 

775
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,990
where you're at okay but I I want to
demonstrate uh that spiritual aspect

776
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,000
demonstrate uh that spiritual aspect
 

777
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,909
demonstrate uh that spiritual aspect
okay because now they're falling into

778
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:40,919
okay because now they're falling into
 

779
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,070
okay because now they're falling into
the boy on the first yield and then the

780
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
the boy on the first yield and then the
 

781
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,830
the boy on the first yield and then the
I adhesion is making them have to fall

782
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:46,840
I adhesion is making them have to fall
 

783
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,590
I adhesion is making them have to fall
into the void okay so you have an

784
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
into the void okay so you have an
 

785
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,430
into the void okay so you have an
inertial resistance to him getting off

786
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,440
inertial resistance to him getting off
 

787
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,470
inertial resistance to him getting off
of that Vector because it was generated

788
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,480
of that Vector because it was generated
 

789
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,270
of that Vector because it was generated
per prescription okay but once he's off

790
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,280
per prescription okay but once he's off
 

791
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,950
per prescription okay but once he's off
on it there's an inertial resistance

792
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
on it there's an inertial resistance
 

793
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,789
on it there's an inertial resistance
it's hard for him to go backwards it's

794
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
it's hard for him to go backwards it's
 

795
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,789
it's hard for him to go backwards it's
hard for him to pull out and then

796
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
hard for him to pull out and then
 

797
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,149
hard for him to pull out and then
there's an i adhesion inside the grip

798
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:07,159
there's an i adhesion inside the grip
 

799
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,830
there's an i adhesion inside the grip
that also adds resistance towards him

800
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
that also adds resistance towards him
 

801
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,390
that also adds resistance towards him
getting off of that inertial resistance

802
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
getting off of that inertial resistance
 

803
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,669
getting off of that inertial resistance
and that's the first sign uh or or the

804
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
and that's the first sign uh or or the
 

805
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,230
and that's the first sign uh or or the
first experience he has and he's not in

806
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
first experience he has and he's not in

control something else someone else is
 

809
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,750
control something else someone else is
in control and fear comes in as he's

810
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:24,760
in control and fear comes in as he's
 

811
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,430
in control and fear comes in as he's
used to seeking control okay it's a fear

812
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:28,440
used to seeking control okay it's a fear
 

813
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,070

response so we'll watch the the two UK

814
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
that void by making the ukas per
 

843
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,710
that void by making the ukas per
prescription come in faster and we'll

844
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,720
prescription come in faster and we'll
 

845
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:52,230
prescription come in faster and we'll
see an elevated resistance towards it so

846
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240

 

847
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,029

off so we'll try to I know it was
 

877
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,710
off so we'll try to I know it was
somewhere around here in this part here

going to be very much like when we were
 

885
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,870
going to be very much like when we were
going over the conceptual breakdown I'm

886
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
going over the conceptual breakdown I'm
 

887
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,870
going over the conceptual breakdown I'm
kind of in this area this is where I was

919
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,269

already so this hand W should go right

920
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
already so this hand W should go right
 

921
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,549
already so this hand W should go right
onto the head as early as possible and

922
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
onto the head as early as possible and
 

923
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,909
onto the head as early as possible and
then the two start

924
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:36,919
then the two start
 

925
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,669
then the two start
working the relationship to tilt him

926
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
working the relationship to tilt him
 

927
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,630
working the relationship to tilt him
okay another common mistake is uh you

928
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
okay another common mistake is uh you
 

929
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,470

and so the co hand follows the head this

932
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:54,840
and so the co hand follows the head this
 

933
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,549
