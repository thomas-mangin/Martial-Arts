obvious to the dors online okay so this
 

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,150
obvious to the dors online okay so this
is push up and go to neutral

00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
is push up and go to neutral
 

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,430
is push up and go to neutral
y there nothing here it's just like

okay so I'm going to project his Center

50
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
okay so I'm going to project his Center
 

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,030
okay so I'm going to project his Center
boom into the front kazushi so not here

52
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,040
boom into the front kazushi so not here
 

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,229
boom into the front kazushi so not here
cuz but I have some turn right then I'm

54
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
cuz but I have some turn right then I'm
 

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,790
cuz but I have some turn right then I'm
not using my hand so you could tell that

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
not using my hand so you could tell that
 

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,110

I went around the fist but you don't do

58
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
I went around the fist but you don't do
 

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,630
I went around the fist but you don't do
it like

60
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:43,640

 

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,470

that I demonstrated it with the hands

62
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
that I demonstrated it with the hands
 

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,270
that I demonstrated it with the hands
okay what I'm trying to not want you to

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,280
okay what I'm trying to not want you to
 

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,070
okay what I'm trying to not want you to
do is this because that's not

66
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
do is this because that's not
 

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,390
do is this because that's not
realistic I can't do

68
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400

 

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,270

that so here neutral boom Jack around I

70
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,280
that so here neutral boom Jack around I
 

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:21,190
that so here neutral boom Jack around I
have the wrist and

I'm touching

80
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm touching
 

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,869
I'm touching
them I'm touching them but I'm not using

00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
them I'm touching them but I'm not using
 

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,390
them I'm touching them but I'm not using
them I'm just here here is where they

84
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
them I'm just here here is where they
 

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,990
them I'm just here here is where they
take

86
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
take
 

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:58,670
take
over as he's folling by

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680

 

89
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,229

following

90
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,239

 

91
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,069

I'm not doing a wrist lock here either

92
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:08,079
I'm not doing a wrist lock here either
 

93
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,789
I'm not doing a wrist lock here either
that would require me to crank it and

94
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
that would require me to crank it and
 

95
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,110
that would require me to crank it and
then push it I'm not touching it I'm not

96
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
then push it I'm not touching it I'm not
 

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,629
then push it I'm not touching it I'm not
touching it and it'll

98
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639

 

99
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,270

work up

100
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280

 

101
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,230

in I took them out to show a point

102
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
in I took them out to show a point
 

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,790
in I took them out to show a point
you're taking them out because your May

104
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
you're taking them out because your May
 

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,830
you're taking them out because your May
is wrong and they don't

106
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
is wrong and they don't
 

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,749
is wrong and they don't
fit try it

108
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759

 

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,990

again so energetically kadori is testing

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
again so energetically kadori is testing
 

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,469
again so energetically kadori is testing
that your C can fill all of your body

112
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
that your C can fill all of your body
 

113
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,629
that your C can fill all of your body
and maintain positional

114
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
and maintain positional
 

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,070
and maintain positional
organization why because the corners are

116
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,080
organization why because the corners are
 

117
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,070
organization why because the corners are
the weak point you can't hold the

118
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
the weak point you can't hold the
 

119
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,110
the weak point you can't hold the
corners you just you can't hold the

120
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
corners you just you can't hold the
 

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,469
corners you just you can't hold the
center it's a yinyang world you don't

122
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
center it's a yinyang world you don't
 

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,870
center it's a yinyang world you don't
have a center if you don't don't have

124
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
have a center if you don't don't have
 

125
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,749
have a center if you don't don't have
corners you got to have periphery to

126
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
corners you got to have periphery to
 

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,189
corners you got to have periphery to
have the center okay but that means they

128
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:04,199
have the center okay but that means they
 

129
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,029
have the center okay but that means they
have to be in relationship with each

130
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:06,039
have to be in relationship with each
 

131
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,950
have to be in relationship with each
other like orbiting Bodies In

132
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:09,960
other like orbiting Bodies In
 

133
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,350
other like orbiting Bodies In
Space you can't just have corners and

134
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
Space you can't just have corners and
 

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,230
Space you can't just have corners and
they do whatever then you don't have a

136
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
they do whatever then you don't have a
 

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,790
they do whatever then you don't have a
center so kadori energetically is

138
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:17,800
center so kadori energetically is
 

139
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,909
center so kadori energetically is
cultivating Corner Integrity by which I

140
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
cultivating Corner Integrity by which I
 

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,550
cultivating Corner Integrity by which I
mean Center

142
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,560

 

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,469

Integrity however

144
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
Integrity however
 

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,390
Integrity however
martially you should not try to

146
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,400
martially you should not try to
 

147
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,070
martially you should not try to
overpower

148
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,080
overpower
 

149
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,070
overpower
people okay so if you pay

150
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
people okay so if you pay
 

151
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,629
people okay so if you pay
attention I I'm not concerned with

152
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
attention I I'm not concerned with
 

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,749

00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,230

me checking over the top can't come into

me checking over the top can't come into
 

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,830
me checking over the top can't come into
my face and I'll take that tradeoff

158
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
my face and I'll take that tradeoff
 

159
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,710

every time all I have to deal with now

160
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:53,720
every time all I have to deal with now
 

161
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,150
every time all I have to deal with now
is his linear energy that's

162
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
is his linear energy that's
