00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,320
hi everyone in today's video we're gonna
look at single Club full circles Gavin

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,330
look at single Club full circles Gavin
 

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,600
look at single Club full circles Gavin
already done so watch my video on single

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:08,610
already done so watch my video on single
 

7
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,120
already done so watch my video on single
Club pendulum swings after come back and

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,130
Club pendulum swings after come back and
 

9
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,310
Club pendulum swings after come back and
watch this video I'll put a link in the

10
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,320
watch this video I'll put a link in the
 

11
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,210
watch this video I'll put a link in the
description below okay so continuing on

12
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,220
description below okay so continuing on
 

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,400
description below okay so continuing on
from the pendulum swing let the momentum

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,410
from the pendulum swing let the momentum
 

15
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,259
from the pendulum swing let the momentum
carry on a bit higher so you end up in a

16
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:24,269
carry on a bit higher so you end up in a
 

17
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,230
carry on a bit higher so you end up in a
10 and 2 o'clock position as you

18
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,240
10 and 2 o'clock position as you
 

19
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,089
10 and 2 o'clock position as you
generate more momentum the coupe that

20
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:29,099
generate more momentum the coupe that
 

21
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,710
generate more momentum the coupe that
will go higher and eventually go all the

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
will go higher and eventually go all the
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,370
will go higher and eventually go all the
way around personally I find this

24
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,380
way around personally I find this
 

25
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,900
way around personally I find this
movement works better with the palm

26
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:35,910
movement works better with the palm
 

27
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,540
movement works better with the palm
facing up as the club's raising and some

28
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,550
facing up as the club's raising and some
 

29
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,400
facing up as the club's raising and some
palm facing down as the club's going

30
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,410
palm facing down as the club's going
 

31
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,430
palm facing down as the club's going
down so the first circle is going

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
down so the first circle is going
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,529
down so the first circle is going
inwards this time I'm going to reverse

34
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:45,539
inwards this time I'm going to reverse
 

35
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,470
inwards this time I'm going to reverse
the direction going outwards so from a

36
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
the direction going outwards so from a
 

37
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,150
the direction going outwards so from a
full circle you can do a basic hand

38
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
full circle you can do a basic hand
 

39
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,750
full circle you can do a basic hand
transfer and drop into a pendulum swing

40
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:52,760
transfer and drop into a pendulum swing
 

41
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,340
transfer and drop into a pendulum swing
and then just repeat the process on the

42
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,350
and then just repeat the process on the
 

43
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,799
and then just repeat the process on the
other side remember to keep your

44
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:57,809
other side remember to keep your
 

45
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,810
other side remember to keep your
shoulder down and now I'm extended as

46
00:00:59,810 --> 00:00:59,820
shoulder down and now I'm extended as
 

47
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,590
shoulder down and now I'm extended as
you take it overhead so with that

48
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
you take it overhead so with that
 

49
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,719
you take it overhead so with that
movement I was going inwards this time

50
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:05,729
movement I was going inwards this time
 

51
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,160
movement I was going inwards this time
I'm going to reverse direction and go

52
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,170
I'm going to reverse direction and go
 

53
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,770
I'm going to reverse direction and go
outwards

54
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:14,780

 

55
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,970

okay so let's take a look at common

56
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:16,980
okay so let's take a look at common
 

57
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,920
okay so let's take a look at common
mistake this is where people try to lift

58
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:18,930
mistake this is where people try to lift
 

59
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,630
mistake this is where people try to lift
the club rather than using that mentor

60
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
the club rather than using that mentor
 

61
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
the club rather than using that mentor
this will result in the elbow collapsing

62
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,890
this will result in the elbow collapsing
 

63
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,130
this will result in the elbow collapsing
and the shoulder coming up you want to

64
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,140
and the shoulder coming up you want to
 

65
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,690
and the shoulder coming up you want to
be conscious of this and avoid at all

66
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
be conscious of this and avoid at all
 

67
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,990
be conscious of this and avoid at all
times so if you have all the correct

68
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
times so if you have all the correct
 

69
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,180
times so if you have all the correct
alignment when you poss should be nice

70
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,190
alignment when you poss should be nice
 

71
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,510
alignment when you poss should be nice
and upright and use the rotation of your

72
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
and upright and use the rotation of your
 

73
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,050
and upright and use the rotation of your
body to generate movement of the club

74
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,060
body to generate movement of the club
 

75
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,760
body to generate movement of the club
you can see here my clubs rotating on a

76
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:43,770
you can see here my clubs rotating on a
 

77
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,270
you can see here my clubs rotating on a
flat vertical play a bit exercise is to

78
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
flat vertical play a bit exercise is to
 

79
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,340
flat vertical play a bit exercise is to
imagine a wall in front of you I'll bet

80
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,350
imagine a wall in front of you I'll bet
 

81
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,870
imagine a wall in front of you I'll bet
they'll do it up against the wall and

82
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
they'll do it up against the wall and
 

83
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,700
they'll do it up against the wall and
this should ensure that you get correct
