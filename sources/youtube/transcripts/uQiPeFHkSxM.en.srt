hi everyone alex gent here so in today's

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
hi everyone alex gent here so in today's
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,510
hi everyone alex gent here so in today's
video i'm going to be talking about

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
video i'm going to be talking about
 

5
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,789
video i'm going to be talking about
anti-spins

6
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
anti-spins
 

7
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,190
anti-spins
how they differ from extensions and in

8
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
how they differ from extensions and in
 

9
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,070
how they differ from extensions and in
spins

10
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
spins
 

11
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,350
spins
make sure you stick around to the end of

12
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
make sure you stick around to the end of
 

13
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,549
make sure you stick around to the end of
the video because i'll also be showing

14
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
the video because i'll also be showing
 

15
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,310
the video because i'll also be showing
the martial application with the kenjo

16
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
the martial application with the kenjo
 

17
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,030
the martial application with the kenjo
and saber

18
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
and saber
 

19
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,470
and saber
okay let's get into it

20
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480

 

21
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,750

so to properly understand what an

22
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
so to properly understand what an
 

23
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,029
so to properly understand what an
anti-spin is we first need to have a

24
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
anti-spin is we first need to have a
 

25
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,670
anti-spin is we first need to have a
look at what an extension and in spit is

26
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
look at what an extension and in spit is
 

27
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,950
look at what an extension and in spit is
if i extend this ball out you can see my

28
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
if i extend this ball out you can see my
 

29
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,230
if i extend this ball out you can see my
arm and

30
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
arm and
 

31
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,389
arm and
the chain and ball are all in line and

32
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
the chain and ball are all in line and
 

33
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,549
the chain and ball are all in line and
they're all rotate in the same direction

34
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
they're all rotate in the same direction
 

35
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,790
they're all rotate in the same direction
so in relation to me they're all going

36
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
so in relation to me they're all going
 

37
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,350
so in relation to me they're all going
anti-clockwise

38
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
anti-clockwise
 

39
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,310
anti-clockwise
if i was to do an in-spin for example

40
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
if i was to do an in-spin for example
 

41
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,950
if i was to do an in-spin for example
like this

42
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
like this
 

43
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,190
like this
or at the sides you can see that the

44
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
or at the sides you can see that the
 

45
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,990
or at the sides you can see that the
ball

46
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
ball
 

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,510
ball
is actually spinning the same direction

48
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
is actually spinning the same direction
 

49
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,310
is actually spinning the same direction
but it's doing more rotations than it

50
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
but it's doing more rotations than it
 

51
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,709
but it's doing more rotations than it
would

52
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
would
 

53
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,110
would
if it was on an extension so that would

54
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
if it was on an extension so that would
 

55
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,709
if it was on an extension so that would
be an extension this will just be an

56
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
be an extension this will just be an
 

57
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,350
be an extension this will just be an
instant

58
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
instant
 

59
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,950
instant
like i say it doesn't matter which point

60
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
like i say it doesn't matter which point
 

61
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,950
like i say it doesn't matter which point
it's fitting it could just be one spin

62
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
it's fitting it could just be one spin
 

63
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,630
it's fitting it could just be one spin
for example on top of my head or it

64
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
for example on top of my head or it
 

65
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,630
for example on top of my head or it
could be at the sides or it could be at

66
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
could be at the sides or it could be at
 

67
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,990
could be at the sides or it could be at
the bottom

68
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
the bottom
 

69
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,350
the bottom
the main thing is that it's actually

70
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
the main thing is that it's actually
 

71
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,350
the main thing is that it's actually
spinning the same direction

72
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
spinning the same direction
 

73
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,390
spinning the same direction
in which my arm is now where that

74
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
in which my arm is now where that
 

75
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,830
in which my arm is now where that
changes

76
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
changes
 

77
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,710
changes
if we were for example doing something

78
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
if we were for example doing something
 

79
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,749
if we were for example doing something
like this

80
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
like this
 

81
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,830
like this
where i'm spinning inwards if i change

82
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
where i'm spinning inwards if i change
 

83
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,789
where i'm spinning inwards if i change
the direction

84
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
the direction
 

85
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,109
the direction
of where my hands going you can see the

86
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
of where my hands going you can see the
 

87
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,870
of where my hands going you can see the
spin of the ball

88
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
spin of the ball
 

89
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,109
spin of the ball
remains the same in terms of that it's

90
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
remains the same in terms of that it's
 

91
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,070
remains the same in terms of that it's
still spinning

92
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
still spinning
 

93
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,030
still spinning
in that anti-clockwise direction whereas

94
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
in that anti-clockwise direction whereas
 

95
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,429
in that anti-clockwise direction whereas
my

96
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
my
 

97
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,910
my
arm in relation to me is now going

98
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
arm in relation to me is now going
 

99
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,670
arm in relation to me is now going
clockwise

100
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
clockwise
 

101
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
clockwise
now with the club i can do the same

102
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
now with the club i can do the same
 

103
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,109
now with the club i can do the same
thing my arm

104
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
thing my arm
 

105
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,830
thing my arm
is moving clockwise and the club is

106
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
is moving clockwise and the club is
 

107
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,630
is moving clockwise and the club is
moving

108
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
moving
 

109
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,230
moving
anticlockwise with the club obviously

110
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
anticlockwise with the club obviously
 

111
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,469
anticlockwise with the club obviously
you can slow it down

112
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
you can slow it down
 

113
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,670
you can slow it down
obviously with the ball and chain you

114
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
obviously with the ball and chain you
 

115
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,830
obviously with the ball and chain you
can't hold it out

116
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

117
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,109

horizontally but here you can have a

118
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
horizontally but here you can have a
 

119
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:55,670
horizontally but here you can have a
look

120
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
look
 

121
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,149
look
the end of it is actually remaining on

122
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
the end of it is actually remaining on
 

123
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,870
the end of it is actually remaining on
the horizontal plate

124
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
the horizontal plate
 

125
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,109
the horizontal plate
and the bit where i'm grabbing is

126
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
and the bit where i'm grabbing is
 

127
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,109
and the bit where i'm grabbing is
actually moving around

128
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
actually moving around
 

129
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,469
actually moving around
in a circular motion

130
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
in a circular motion
 

131
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,190
in a circular motion
so then when you put the two together it

132
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
so then when you put the two together it
 

133
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,670
so then when you put the two together it
looks something like that

134
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680

 

135
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,830

now the same could be done on a vertical

136
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

137
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,270

plane

138
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
plane
 

139
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,630
plane
now with the staff you're essentially

140
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
now with the staff you're essentially
 

141
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,270
now with the staff you're essentially
combining those two movements together

142
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
combining those two movements together
 

143
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,350
combining those two movements together
one end is working on the horizontal

144
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
one end is working on the horizontal
 

145
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,949
one end is working on the horizontal
plane which is this

146
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
plane which is this
 

147
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,869
plane which is this
end and the other end is working on the

148
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
end and the other end is working on the
 

149
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,750
end and the other end is working on the
vertical plate so as this goes out to

150
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
vertical plate so as this goes out to
 

151
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,990
vertical plate so as this goes out to
the side this is going up

152
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
the side this is going up
 

153
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,630
the side this is going up
and this end is going across on the

154
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
and this end is going across on the
 

155
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,390
and this end is going across on the
horizontal plane

156
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
horizontal plane
 

157
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,910
horizontal plane
the same movement could be also done

158
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
the same movement could be also done
 

159
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,309
the same movement could be also done
taking this side behind

160
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
taking this side behind
 

161
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,390
taking this side behind
the head so for example instead of

162
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
the head so for example instead of
 

163
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,430
the head so for example instead of
taking in front i could take it behind

164
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
taking in front i could take it behind
 

165
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,949
taking in front i could take it behind
again that movement would look something

166
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
again that movement would look something
 

167
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,270
again that movement would look something
like that

168
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280

 

169
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,190

but you can see all the principles i've

170
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
but you can see all the principles i've
 

171
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,309
but you can see all the principles i've
talked about before

172
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
talked about before
 

173
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,430
talked about before
weightlessness and isolations

174
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
weightlessness and isolations
 

175
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,869
weightlessness and isolations
they all come into play here because

176
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
they all come into play here because
 

177
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,550
they all come into play here because
actually an anti-spin

178
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
actually an anti-spin
 

179
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,509
actually an anti-spin
is a type of isolation you can see here

180
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
is a type of isolation you can see here
 

181
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,630
is a type of isolation you can see here
i'm letting the momentum

182
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
i'm letting the momentum
 

183
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,589
i'm letting the momentum
of the staff do the work in terms of the

184
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
of the staff do the work in terms of the
 

185
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,869
of the staff do the work in terms of the
weight

186
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
weight
 

187
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,550
weight
as this bounces up and down and also

188
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
as this bounces up and down and also
 

189
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,149
as this bounces up and down and also
like i mentioned with the isolations

190
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
like i mentioned with the isolations
 

191
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,350
like i mentioned with the isolations
before i'm getting behind the movement

192
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
before i'm getting behind the movement
 

193
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,390
before i'm getting behind the movement
of there and it's going into this linear

194
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
of there and it's going into this linear
 

195
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,470
of there and it's going into this linear
uh motion now i can just switch this

196
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
uh motion now i can just switch this
 

197
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,110
uh motion now i can just switch this
into an anti-spin just by letting the

198
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
into an anti-spin just by letting the
 

199
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,589
into an anti-spin just by letting the
motion

200
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
motion
 

201
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,630
motion
continue and it kind of forms this um

202
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
continue and it kind of forms this um
 

203
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,430
continue and it kind of forms this um
diamond shape now there's so many

204
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
diamond shape now there's so many
 

205
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,949
diamond shape now there's so many
different types of anti-spins that you

206
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
different types of anti-spins that you
 

207
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,350
different types of anti-spins that you
can do

208
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
can do
 

209
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,190
can do

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
and enhancement is just a type of
 

211
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,030

well in a previous video i talk about

216
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
well in a previous video i talk about
 

217
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,630
well in a previous video i talk about
isolations and i mentioned the 15th joe

218
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
isolations and i mentioned the 15th joe
 

219
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,589
isolations and i mentioned the 15th joe

00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
now this essentially is a type of
 

223
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,149
now this essentially is a type of
isolation it's part of

224
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
isolation it's part of
 

225
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,270
isolation it's part of
the quadrant the top quadrant on a

the quadrant the top quadrant on a
 

227
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,869
the quadrant the top quadrant on a
anti-spin but where else does this fit

228
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
anti-spin but where else does this fit
 

229
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,429
anti-spin but where else does this fit

well if i talked about raising the joe

232
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
well if i talked about raising the joe
 

233
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,550
well if i talked about raising the joe
if i raise it in this manner

234
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
if i raise it in this manner
 

235
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,990
if i raise it in this manner
i'm actually raising in a

236
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
i'm actually raising in a
 

237
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,270
i'm actually raising in a
in spin as i mentioned earlier

238
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
in spin as i mentioned earlier
 

239
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,430
in spin as i mentioned earlier
this is an inspin so i'm raising

240
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
this is an inspin so i'm raising
 

241
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,749
this is an inspin so i'm raising
in an instant weight and then when i'm

242
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
in an instant weight and then when i'm
 

243
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,950
in an instant weight and then when i'm
putting down

244
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
putting down
 

245
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,790
putting down
i'm just reversing the direction so i'm

246
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
i'm just reversing the direction so i'm
 

247
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,070
i'm just reversing the direction so i'm
actually cutting down

248
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
actually cutting down
 

249
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,550
actually cutting down
in a way that you would call an in spin

250
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
in a way that you would call an in spin
 

251
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,990
in a way that you would call an in spin
because it's rotating

252
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
because it's rotating
 

253
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,510
because it's rotating
the same direction in which my arm is

254
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
the same direction in which my arm is
 

255
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,510
the same direction in which my arm is
rotate okay obviously the difference is

256
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
rotate okay obviously the difference is
 

257
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,230
rotate okay obviously the difference is
we're just working on this one quadrant

258
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
we're just working on this one quadrant
 

259
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,510
we're just working on this one quadrant
so it's raising up

260
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
so it's raising up
 

261
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,710
so it's raising up
on an in spin cutting down

262
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
on an in spin cutting down
 

263
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,189
on an in spin cutting down
on an instant now if we want to change

264
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
on an instant now if we want to change
 

265
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,950
on an instant now if we want to change
that

266
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
that
 

267
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,469
that
and raise it up like this

268
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
and raise it up like this
 

269
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,940
and raise it up like this
and cut down

270
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:55,950
and cut down
 

271
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,830
and cut down

it's now clean it's raising on a

274
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
it's now clean it's raising on a
 

275
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,670
it's now clean it's raising on a
anti-spin

276
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
anti-spin
 

277
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,629
anti-spin
which is like that and then it's joining

278
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
which is like that and then it's joining
 

279
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,430
which is like that and then it's joining
up

280
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
up
 

281
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,710
up
with the in-spin so it's actually

282
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
with the in-spin so it's actually
 

283
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,140
with the in-spin so it's actually
creating one circle

284
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,150
creating one circle
 

285
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,390
creating one circle

now it's probably easier to relate to

288
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
now it's probably easier to relate to
 

289
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,430
now it's probably easier to relate to
this movement when i do it with the ken

290
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
this movement when i do it with the ken
 

291
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,270
this movement when i do it with the ken
take the first ken saburi

292
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280

 

293
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,510

that movement there as i mentioned we've

294
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
that movement there as i mentioned we've
 

295
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,310
that movement there as i mentioned we've
got the in spin coming up

296
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
got the in spin coming up
 

297
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,070
got the in spin coming up
and then he's been coming down

298
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080

 

299
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,670

if for example we switch to

300
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
if for example we switch to
 

301
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,990
if for example we switch to
the fifth kensebury

302
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000

 

303
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,670

you can have a look that when it comes

304
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
you can have a look that when it comes
 

305
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,310
you can have a look that when it comes
round into this position

306
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
round into this position
 

307
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,310
round into this position
we're actually using that same idea of

308
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
we're actually using that same idea of
 

309
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,830
we're actually using that same idea of
an anti-stone

310
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
an anti-stone
 

311
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,110
an anti-stone
to take it round

312
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
to take it round
 

313
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,990
to take it round
because we're not raising it in a way

314
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
because we're not raising it in a way
 

315
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,070
because we're not raising it in a way
where it raises up first

316
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
where it raises up first
 

317
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,309
where it raises up first
in lane cuts we're actually taking it

318
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
in lane cuts we're actually taking it
 

319
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,909
in lane cuts we're actually taking it
around to the side

320
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
around to the side
 

321
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,110
around to the side
and it's creating this anti-spin feeling

322
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
and it's creating this anti-spin feeling
 

323
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,270
and it's creating this anti-spin feeling
it's that feeling that it's creating

324
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
it's that feeling that it's creating
 

325
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,710
it's that feeling that it's creating
when it goes to the side

326
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
when it goes to the side
 

327
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,830
when it goes to the side
here and then behind the head

328
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
here and then behind the head
 

329
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,670
here and then behind the head
and then clean

330
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680

 

331
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,150

so it's going from being horizontal

332
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
so it's going from being horizontal
 

333
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,469
so it's going from being horizontal
to being down in line with it with your

334
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
to being down in line with it with your
 

335
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,189
to being down in line with it with your
back

336
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
back
 

337
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,189
back
and then it's going into that in spin

338
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
and then it's going into that in spin
 

339
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,309
and then it's going into that in spin
motion

340
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
motion
 

341
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,870
motion
when cutting so again looking over the

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,749
when cutting so again looking over the
saber

344
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
saber
 

345
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,790
saber
if you take this movement here it's the

346
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
if you take this movement here it's the
 

347
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,070
if you take this movement here it's the
same thing

348
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
same thing
 

349
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,110
same thing
i'm raising it up and this is kind

350
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
i'm raising it up and this is kind
 

351
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,629
i'm raising it up and this is kind
it's kind of like it's going into that

352
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
it's kind of like it's going into that
 

353
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,469
it's kind of like it's going into that
anti-spin motion

354
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
anti-spin motion
 

355
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,629
anti-spin motion
again just working on this top quadrant

356
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
again just working on this top quadrant
 

357
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,230
again just working on this top quadrant
as i raise it up

358
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
as i raise it up
 

359
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,749
as i raise it up
it's as if it's going into the anti-spin

360
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
it's as if it's going into the anti-spin
 

361
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,749
it's as if it's going into the anti-spin
but then it continues that circle

362
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
but then it continues that circle
 

363
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,110
but then it continues that circle
to cut down in a in spin motion

364
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
to cut down in a in spin motion
 

365
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,150
to cut down in a in spin motion
like we're doing an inspect

366
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
like we're doing an inspect
 

367
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,790
like we're doing an inspect
so it comes up with an anti-spin cuts

368
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
so it comes up with an anti-spin cuts
 

369
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,150
so it comes up with an anti-spin cuts
down with an insulin

370
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
down with an insulin
 

371
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,589
down with an insulin
anyway i hope you found this interesting

372
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
anyway i hope you found this interesting
 

373
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,189
anyway i hope you found this interesting
and you can relate to this concept

374
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
and you can relate to this concept
 

375
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,870
and you can relate to this concept
i'll be covering anti-spins in a little

376
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
i'll be covering anti-spins in a little
 

377
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,870
i'll be covering anti-spins in a little
bit more detail in future videos

378
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
bit more detail in future videos
