00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,310

[Music]

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320

 

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,749

Uh, let's go over how to get up from the

4
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
Uh, let's go over how to get up from the
 

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,230
Uh, let's go over how to get up from the
roll.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,240
roll.
 

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,910
roll.
Okay, so we already did all the other

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
Okay, so we already did all the other
 

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,310
Okay, so we already did all the other
stuff. Uh, I'm just going to

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,320
stuff. Uh, I'm just going to
 

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,830
stuff. Uh, I'm just going to
roll. This is how I get up. My hips are

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
roll. This is how I get up. My hips are
 

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,310
roll. This is how I get up. My hips are
going to be lower than my shoulder.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
going to be lower than my shoulder.
 

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,669
going to be lower than my shoulder.
There's no more inertia going that way.

16
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
There's no more inertia going that way.
 

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,990
There's no more inertia going that way.
I step up and I'll move back into hanmi.

18
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,000
I step up and I'll move back into hanmi.
 

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,190
I step up and I'll move back into hanmi.
Okay, I'll do it

20
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay, I'll do it
 

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,350
Okay, I'll do it
again.

22
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,360
again.
 

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:01:07,590
again.
Boom. Into hanmi. Okay, let's try that.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600

 

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,070

All right. So, uh, in the first clip I

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
All right. So, uh, in the first clip I
 

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,830
All right. So, uh, in the first clip I
noted like there's no more

28
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:14,840
noted like there's no more
 

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,350
noted like there's no more
inertia going that way before you come

30
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
inertia going that way before you come
 

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,710
inertia going that way before you come
up. And so, to be clear, my h I will

32
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
up. And so, to be clear, my h I will
 

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,190
up. And so, to be clear, my h I will
take a four-point

34
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,200
take a four-point
 

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,590
take a four-point
stance and my hands will stay on the mat

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
stance and my hands will stay on the mat
 

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,630
stance and my hands will stay on the mat
until that inertia leaves. Okay? So, it

38
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
until that inertia leaves. Okay? So, it
 

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,230
until that inertia leaves. Okay? So, it
it would it's looking like this. You

40
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
it would it's looking like this. You
 

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,710
it would it's looking like this. You
going to watch how my

42
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:31,720
going to watch how my
 

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,910
going to watch how my
hands stay on the mat. Inertia left.

44
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
hands stay on the mat. Inertia left.
 

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,310
hands stay on the mat. Inertia left.
Then I came

46
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
Then I came
 

47
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,030
Then I came
up. Inertia left. Then I came up. I

48
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
up. Inertia left. Then I came up. I
 

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,350
up. Inertia left. Then I came up. I
don't want to

50
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
don't want to
 

51
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,870
don't want to
use momentum to come up like that. Okay.

52
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
use momentum to come up like that. Okay.
 

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,710
use momentum to come up like that. Okay.
Uh the reason

54
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720

 

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,149

being you roll that way and use your

56
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
being you roll that way and use your
 

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,270
being you roll that way and use your
momentum to come up.

58
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,280

 

59
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,230

Okay. If I got

60
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,240
Okay. If I got
 

61
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,149
Okay. If I got
thrown, why do I want to focus on the

62
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
thrown, why do I want to focus on the
 

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,310
thrown, why do I want to focus on the
nagg? Because that's teaching me that's

64
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
nagg? Because that's teaching me that's
 

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,589
nagg? Because that's teaching me that's
the threat and we don't break obs on the

66
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
the threat and we don't break obs on the
 

67
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,110
the threat and we don't break obs on the
threat. You just you don't ever do that.

68
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
threat. You just you don't ever do that.
 

69
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,790
threat. You just you don't ever do that.
Okay? So, if I'm still the threat, he

70
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
Okay? So, if I'm still the threat, he
 

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,030
Okay? So, if I'm still the threat, he
survived the throw. He goes to do that,

72
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
survived the throw. He goes to do that,
 

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,910
survived the throw. He goes to do that,
he does that, and you're going to get

74
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
he does that, and you're going to get
 

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,670
he does that, and you're going to get
him very easily. Okay?

76
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,680
him very easily. Okay?
 

77
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,710
him very easily. Okay?
So you don't want to get

78
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:29,720
So you don't want to get
 

79
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,150
So you don't want to get
up fast or

80
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,160
up fast or
 

81
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,030
up fast or
easily. You get up when you can. And you

82
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
easily. You get up when you can. And you
 

83
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,509
easily. You get up when you can. And you
have to assess first whether you can get

84
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
have to assess first whether you can get
 

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,270
have to assess first whether you can get
up or not. Okay? And that if I have to

86
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
up or not. Okay? And that if I have to
 

87
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,470
up or not. Okay? And that if I have to
assess, I'm going to assess from the

88
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
assess, I'm going to assess from the
 

89
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,390
assess, I'm going to assess from the
most stable neutral position that I can.

90
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
most stable neutral position that I can.
 

91
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,949
most stable neutral position that I can.
And transitioning from gdedon up to

92
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:53,959
And transitioning from gdedon up to
 

93
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,270
And transitioning from gdedon up to
jodon is not a neutral position because

94
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
jodon is not a neutral position because
 

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,309
jodon is not a neutral position because
I am generating

96
00:02:59,309 --> 00:02:59,319
I am generating
 

97
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,910
I am generating
inertia on top of the roll. So we don't

98
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
inertia on top of the roll. So we don't
 

99
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,390
inertia on top of the roll. So we don't
do you never seek height when someone's

100
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
do you never seek height when someone's
 

101
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,430
do you never seek height when someone's
charging at you. You have to be clear of

102
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
charging at you. You have to be clear of
 

103
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,750
charging at you. You have to be clear of
that attack before you actually seek

104
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
that attack before you actually seek
 

105
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,550
that attack before you actually seek
height. So all the inertia is gone.

106
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
height. So all the inertia is gone.
 

107
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,990
height. So all the inertia is gone.
Hands stay on the mat and the movement

108
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
Hands stay on the mat and the movement
 

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,830
Hands stay on the mat and the movement
from here to Han me is totally

110
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
from here to Han me is totally
 

111
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,190
from here to Han me is totally
uh done under your complete power.

112
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
uh done under your complete power.
 

113
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,430
uh done under your complete power.
There's no inertia that's assisting you

114
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
There's no inertia that's assisting you
 

115
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:51,430
There's no inertia that's assisting you
to get there. Okay, we'll try it again.

116
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440

 

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,830

So here would be my naga. Okay. And he

118
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
So here would be my naga. Okay. And he
 

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,429
So here would be my naga. Okay. And he
would throw me that way. And my eyes are

120
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
would throw me that way. And my eyes are
 

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,710
would throw me that way. And my eyes are
on him the entire time. So I don't look

122
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
on him the entire time. So I don't look
 

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,550
on him the entire time. So I don't look
this way. I don't look down. I'm going

124
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
this way. I don't look down. I'm going
 

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,429
this way. I don't look down. I'm going
to all always look look at him as I do

126
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
to all always look look at him as I do
 

127
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,630
to all always look look at him as I do
my roll. Always looking at him. My head

128
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
my roll. Always looking at him. My head
 

129
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,949
my roll. Always looking at him. My head
turns really quick when I when I do

130
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
turns really quick when I when I do
 

131
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,949
turns really quick when I when I do
that.

132
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:15,959
that.
 

133
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,870
that.
Okay, really quick. When I do that,

134
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
Okay, really quick. When I do that,
 

135
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:34,909
Okay, really quick. When I do that,
okay, let's bring that

136
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:34,919

 

137
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,469

in. All right. when you get up, you are

138
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
in. All right. when you get up, you are
 

139
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,469
in. All right. when you get up, you are
already uh vectoring your mass, your

140
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
already uh vectoring your mass, your
 

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,270
already uh vectoring your mass, your
young aspect onto your midfoot and it is

142
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
young aspect onto your midfoot and it is
 

143
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,189
young aspect onto your midfoot and it is
very much like a back squat at that

144
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
very much like a back squat at that
 

145
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,390
very much like a back squat at that
point. Um so a drill that I like to do

146
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,400
point. Um so a drill that I like to do
 

147
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,070
point. Um so a drill that I like to do
because even here today I have people

148
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
because even here today I have people
 

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,469
because even here today I have people
that are using some inertia or have the

150
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
that are using some inertia or have the
 

151
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,670
that are using some inertia or have the
inertia shift their weight to their

152
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:00,680
inertia shift their weight to their
 

153
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,590
inertia shift their weight to their
heels. Let's say Andor has the inertia

154
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
heels. Let's say Andor has the inertia
 

155
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,430
heels. Let's say Andor has the inertia
shift their weight to their heels. And

156
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
shift their weight to their heels. And
 

157
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,909
shift their weight to their heels. And
this is just not marshially viable. So

158
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
this is just not marshially viable. So
 

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,430
this is just not marshially viable. So
we do the other this drill to to uh get

160
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
we do the other this drill to to uh get
 

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,230
we do the other this drill to to uh get
us aware of what's happening to our body

162
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
us aware of what's happening to our body
 

163
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,469
us aware of what's happening to our body
with this inertia. So I will do the

164
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:17,479
with this inertia. So I will do the
 

165
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,310
with this inertia. So I will do the
roll. Uh he will come in while I'm in

166
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
roll. Uh he will come in while I'm in
 

167
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,270
roll. Uh he will come in while I'm in
this position. He'll come in and I will

168
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
this position. He'll come in and I will
 

169
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,029
this position. He'll come in and I will
just pick him

170
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,039
just pick him
 

171
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,310
just pick him
up. We'll do it again. We're here. He

172
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
up. We'll do it again. We're here. He
 

173
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,350
up. We'll do it again. We're here. He
comes in and I will pick him

174
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,360
comes in and I will pick him
 

175
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,950
comes in and I will pick him
up again. He comes

176
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
up again. He comes
 

177
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,189
up again. He comes
in and I will pick him

178
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:44,199
in and I will pick him
 

179
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,189
in and I will pick him
up. Okay. I'm not trying to throw him.

180
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
up. Okay. I'm not trying to throw him.
 

181
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,710
up. Okay. I'm not trying to throw him.
I'm just letting him off my shoulder at

182
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm just letting him off my shoulder at
 

183
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,189
I'm just letting him off my shoulder at
the end. All right. Try. So, I'll better

184
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
the end. All right. Try. So, I'll better
 

185
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,590
the end. All right. Try. So, I'll better
uh describe the drill. We haven't done

186
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
uh describe the drill. We haven't done
 

187
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,510
uh describe the drill. We haven't done
it in a while. Taylor forgot it. All the

188
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
it in a while. Taylor forgot it. All the
 

189
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,469
it in a while. Taylor forgot it. All the
UK does is just keep walking towards the

190
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
UK does is just keep walking towards the
 

191
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,270
UK does is just keep walking towards the
person. He stopped on me on that first

192
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
person. He stopped on me on that first
 

193
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,670
person. He stopped on me on that first
rep. Some of you were stopping on each

194
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
rep. Some of you were stopping on each
 

195
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,590
rep. Some of you were stopping on each
other, but he just walks towards me,

196
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
other, but he just walks towards me,
 

197
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,469
other, but he just walks towards me,
over me, and I'm

198
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:09,479
over me, and I'm
 

199
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,390
over me, and I'm
up. Okay.

200
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,400

 

201
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,670

Again, right here, he walks towards me,

202
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
Again, right here, he walks towards me,
 

203
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,070
Again, right here, he walks towards me,
and I'm

204
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,080
and I'm
 

205
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,710
and I'm
up. Okay. If I was on my heels, when he

206
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
up. Okay. If I was on my heels, when he
 

207
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,950
up. Okay. If I was on my heels, when he
walked towards me, he'd knock me back.

208
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
walked towards me, he'd knock me back.
 

209
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,749
walked towards me, he'd knock me back.
Okay? That's why he has to keep walking.

210
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
Okay? That's why he has to keep walking.
 

211
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,710
Okay? That's why he has to keep walking.
He would expose the heel weight. Okay,

212
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
He would expose the heel weight. Okay,
 

213
00:06:30,720 --> 00:07:14,230
He would expose the heel weight. Okay,
try it again.

214
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240

 

215
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,469

Andrew's going to roll. Let's go ahead.

216
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
Andrew's going to roll. Let's go ahead.
 

217
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,350
Andrew's going to roll. Let's go ahead.
Go ahead. Good. We'll do it again from

218
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
Go ahead. Good. We'll do it again from
 

219
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:38,309
Go ahead. Good. We'll do it again from
that side.

220
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319

 

221
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,350

We'll do it again from that

222
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,360
We'll do it again from that
 

223
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,350
We'll do it again from that
side. Use that line. Please stop. Use

224
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
side. Use that line. Please stop. Use
 

225
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,350
side. Use that line. Please stop. Use
that line right there.

226
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
that line right there.
 

227
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,309
that line right there.
Go

228
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:51,319

 

229
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,990

again. Okay. You can see how he's going

230
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
again. Okay. You can see how he's going
 

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,270
again. Okay. You can see how he's going
in. He's rolling inwardly. On the first

232
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
in. He's rolling inwardly. On the first
 

233
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,909
in. He's rolling inwardly. On the first
rep where he didn't have the line, it

234
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
rep where he didn't have the line, it
 

235
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,070
rep where he didn't have the line, it
was even more pronounced. Now he has the

236
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
was even more pronounced. Now he has the
 

237
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,230
was even more pronounced. Now he has the
line and he realizes, "Oh yeah, Sensei

238
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
line and he realizes, "Oh yeah, Sensei
 

239
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,070
line and he realizes, "Oh yeah, Sensei
don't like us rolling inwardly, so I'm

240
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
don't like us rolling inwardly, so I'm
 

241
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,990
don't like us rolling inwardly, so I'm
going to fix myself." Why don't you fix

242
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
going to fix myself." Why don't you fix
 

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,710
going to fix myself." Why don't you fix
yourself without me here? Right. Okay.

244
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
yourself without me here? Right. Okay.
 

245
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,790
yourself without me here? Right. Okay.
What I want you to do is you see that

246
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
What I want you to do is you see that
 

247
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,070
What I want you to do is you see that
line? You're going to roll with your

248
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
line? You're going to roll with your
 

249
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,629
line? You're going to roll with your
hips going north. So that would be to

250
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
hips going north. So that would be to
 

251
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,710
hips going north. So that would be to
your right. You're not going to even

252
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
your right. You're not going to even
 

253
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,629
your right. You're not going to even
roll straight this time.

254
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:23,639
roll straight this time.
 

255
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,390
roll straight this time.
Go. There you go. and

256
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,400

 

257
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,029

again and

258
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:34,039

 

259
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,630

again. Okay, so that's the drill I would

260
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
again. Okay, so that's the drill I would
 

261
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,790
again. Okay, so that's the drill I would
like for you all to do in this uh in the

262
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
like for you all to do in this uh in the
 

263
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,589
like for you all to do in this uh in the
small forward roll.

264
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599
small forward roll.
 

265
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,470
small forward roll.
Okay, we already

266
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:43,480
Okay, we already
 

267
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,030
Okay, we already
know that the closer my hips, the

268
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
know that the closer my hips, the
 

269
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,470
know that the closer my hips, the
vertical vector of my hips is to the

270
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
vertical vector of my hips is to the
 

271
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,590
vertical vector of my hips is to the
vertical vector of my

272
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,600
vertical vector of my
 

273
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,110
vertical vector of my
shoulders, then I'm going to have more

274
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
shoulders, then I'm going to have more
 

275
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,030
shoulders, then I'm going to have more
stacking of mass. I'm going to have more

276
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
stacking of mass. I'm going to have more
 

277
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,150
stacking of mass. I'm going to have more
mass at impact with the

278
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,160
mass at impact with the
 

279
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,829
mass at impact with the
mat. Mass times acceleration equals

280
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
mat. Mass times acceleration equals
 

281
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,350
mat. Mass times acceleration equals
force. Therefore, I'm going to have more

282
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
force. Therefore, I'm going to have more
 

283
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,310
force. Therefore, I'm going to have more
force at contact with the mat.

284
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
force at contact with the mat.
 

285
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,110
force at contact with the mat.
The longest or the furthest distance I

286
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
The longest or the furthest distance I
 

287
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,790
The longest or the furthest distance I
can have between the shoulder vertical

288
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
can have between the shoulder vertical
 

289
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,870
can have between the shoulder vertical
plane and the hip vertical plane is the

290
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
plane and the hip vertical plane is the
 

291
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,070
plane and the hip vertical plane is the
one you see right now. The length of my

292
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,080

 

293
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,389

spine. If we tuck, I just brought my

294
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
spine. If we tuck, I just brought my
 

295
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,110
spine. If we tuck, I just brought my
hips closer to my

296
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,120
hips closer to my
 

297
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,150
hips closer to my
shoulders. We don't want to do that

298
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
shoulders. We don't want to do that
 

299
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,750
shoulders. We don't want to do that
because that's going to stack mass.

300
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
because that's going to stack mass.
 

301
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,910
because that's going to stack mass.
That's going to increase mass, increase

302
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
That's going to increase mass, increase
 

303
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,910
That's going to increase mass, increase
force at impact.

304
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920

 

305
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,389

One of the things that is getting you is

306
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
One of the things that is getting you is
 

307
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,150
One of the things that is getting you is
you're stuck in in the

308
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160

 

309
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,870

somersaulting. This in Japanese this is

310
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:41,880
somersaulting. This in Japanese this is
 

311
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,630
somersaulting. This in Japanese this is
maui. There's there's no reference to

312
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
maui. There's there's no reference to
 

313
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,509
maui. There's there's no reference to
rolling or somersaulting in that

314
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
rolling or somersaulting in that
 

315
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,430
rolling or somersaulting in that
phrase. But you want to somersault. So

316
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
phrase. But you want to somersault. So
 

317
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,710
phrase. But you want to somersault. So
you want to

318
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:53,720
you want to
 

319
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,670
you want to
talk. We don't want a

320
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:56,680
talk. We don't want a
 

321
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,190
talk. We don't want a
somersault.

322
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
somersault.
 

323
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,509
somersault.
Ideally, this is be the least stacked

324
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
Ideally, this is be the least stacked
 

325
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,350
Ideally, this is be the least stacked
mass I could ever have. So, the closer I

326
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
mass I could ever have. So, the closer I
 

327
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,470
mass I could ever have. So, the closer I
get to

328
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,480
get to
 

329
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,269
get to
that, the from higher I could be thrown

330
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
that, the from higher I could be thrown
 

331
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,590
that, the from higher I could be thrown
and still not have that great a force at

332
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,600

 

333
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,350

impact. Secondarily, aside from the

334
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,360
impact. Secondarily, aside from the
 

335
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,030
impact. Secondarily, aside from the
somersault, you have this preoccupation

336
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,040
somersault, you have this preoccupation
 

337
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,389
somersault, you have this preoccupation
with how to stand.

338
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:27,399
with how to stand.
 

339
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,750
with how to stand.
Okay. So, you're what you're doing is

340
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
Okay. So, you're what you're doing is
 

341
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,710
Okay. So, you're what you're doing is
you're keeping your feet on the hip

342
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
you're keeping your feet on the hip
 

343
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,590
you're keeping your feet on the hip
vertical

344
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,600
vertical
 

345
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,550
vertical
plane. It'll look like this. Okay? So,

346
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
plane. It'll look like this. Okay? So,
 

347
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,110
plane. It'll look like this. Okay? So,
I'm on this line and I keep my

348
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm on this line and I keep my
 

349
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,030
I'm on this line and I keep my
feet on that line.

350
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040

 

351
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,269

If in that effort my knees go towards my

352
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
If in that effort my knees go towards my
 

353
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,509
If in that effort my knees go towards my
face, I'm going to bring the tailbone

354
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
face, I'm going to bring the tailbone
 

355
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,630
face, I'm going to bring the tailbone
into a tucked position and I'm going to

356
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
into a tucked position and I'm going to
 

357
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,910
into a tucked position and I'm going to
cause all the problems we just

358
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:04,920

 

359
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,550

said. In the X pattern, my legs will go

360
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
said. In the X pattern, my legs will go
 

361
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,389
said. In the X pattern, my legs will go
like

362
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:09,399
like
 

363
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,230
like
this. They will not be able to stay

364
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
this. They will not be able to stay
 

365
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,190
this. They will not be able to stay
where my hips are. They they can't do

366
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
where my hips are. They they can't do
 

367
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,750
where my hips are. They they can't do
it. So, usually what

368
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:18,760
it. So, usually what
 

369
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,750
it. So, usually what
happens when we throw someone who's

370
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
happens when we throw someone who's
 

371
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,670
happens when we throw someone who's
trying to tuck their legs, leave them on

372
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
trying to tuck their legs, leave them on
 

373
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,389
trying to tuck their legs, leave them on
the hip vertical

374
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:25,399
the hip vertical
 

375
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,710
the hip vertical
plane, they will flip in the air and

376
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
plane, they will flip in the air and
 

377
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,910
plane, they will flip in the air and
land just solidly on the hipbone. They

378
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
land just solidly on the hipbone. They
 

379
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,949
land just solidly on the hipbone. They
kind of do like a a sit when they get

380
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
kind of do like a a sit when they get
 

381
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,110
kind of do like a a sit when they get
flipped in the air. Okay. Um, you have

382
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
flipped in the air. Okay. Um, you have
 

383
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,310
flipped in the air. Okay. Um, you have
to not resist nor assist the technique.

384
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
to not resist nor assist the technique.
 

385
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,389
to not resist nor assist the technique.
So as your legs are going out with the

386
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
So as your legs are going out with the
 

387
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,710
So as your legs are going out with the
centrifugal energy, you should let your

388
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
centrifugal energy, you should let your
 

389
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,430
centrifugal energy, you should let your
legs go

390
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,440
legs go
 

391
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,990
legs go
out. So rather than have my feet on this

392
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
out. So rather than have my feet on this
 

393
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,710
out. So rather than have my feet on this
hip vertical plane marked noted by this

394
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
hip vertical plane marked noted by this
 

395
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,870
hip vertical plane marked noted by this
line, my feet go that way as if I was

396
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
line, my feet go that way as if I was
 

397
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,190
line, my feet go that way as if I was
trying to do

398
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,200

 

399
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,750

this. So watch how my feet logo in our

400
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
this. So watch how my feet logo in our
 

401
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,190
this. So watch how my feet logo in our
dojo. That's north. So that's west. My

402
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:14,200
dojo. That's north. So that's west. My
 

403
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:32,750
dojo. That's north. So that's west. My
feet will go

404
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:32,760

 

405
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,990

west. Almost like I'm trying to step on

406
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
west. Almost like I'm trying to step on
 

407
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,269
west. Almost like I'm trying to step on
that wall over

408
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:38,279
that wall over
 

409
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,110
that wall over
there. I will still find my feet.

410
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
there. I will still find my feet.
 

411
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,590
there. I will still find my feet.
Exactly like before, meaning I'm

412
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:44,600
Exactly like before, meaning I'm
 

413
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,670
Exactly like before, meaning I'm
standing. I will still have no inertia

414
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
standing. I will still have no inertia
 

415
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,030
standing. I will still have no inertia
when I get up and I'm still able to have

416
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
when I get up and I'm still able to have
 

417
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,470
when I get up and I'm still able to have
resist somebody that's coming on me and

418
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
resist somebody that's coming on me and
 

419
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,350
resist somebody that's coming on me and
be able to pick them up. Okay. So, let's

420
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
be able to pick them up. Okay. So, let's
 

421
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,269
be able to pick them up. Okay. So, let's
get our feet, our legs to come out and

422
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
get our feet, our legs to come out and
 

423
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,750
get our feet, our legs to come out and
get our knees and our and our leg mass

424
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
get our knees and our and our leg mass
 

425
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:19,190
get our knees and our and our leg mass
off the hip vertical plane.

426
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200

 

427
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,949

So, training is always

428
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
So, training is always
 

429
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,430
So, training is always
progressionbased.

430
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,440

 

431
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,990

Um, okay. Can we make sure they're both

432
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
Um, okay. Can we make sure they're both
 

433
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,230
Um, okay. Can we make sure they're both
on? Is it That's the batteries. Press

434
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
on? Is it That's the batteries. Press
 

435
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,710
on? Is it That's the batteries. Press
stop, please. All right. Listen very

436
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
stop, please. All right. Listen very
 

437
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,190
stop, please. All right. Listen very
closely.

438
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,200
closely.
 

439
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,670
closely.
you training has to be

440
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:40,680

 

441
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,710

progressionbased. No beginner should

442
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
progressionbased. No beginner should
 

443
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,350
progressionbased. No beginner should
ever come in and

444
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,360
ever come in and
 

445
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,310
ever come in and
do all that you can do. It's just if if

446
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
do all that you can do. It's just if if
 

447
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,790
do all that you can do. It's just if if
that is

448
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:49,800
that is
 

449
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,629
that is
possible, then you're not doing all you

450
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
possible, then you're not doing all you
 

451
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,750
possible, then you're not doing all you
can

452
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:54,760
can
 

453
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,110
can
do. It has to be so inevitable in your

454
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,120
do. It has to be so inevitable in your
 

455
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,189
do. It has to be so inevitable in your
mind. Like today is Tuesday. I know for

456
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
mind. Like today is Tuesday. I know for
 

457
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,550
mind. Like today is Tuesday. I know for
a fact tomorrow is Wednesday.

458
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
a fact tomorrow is Wednesday.

460
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:08,600
is inevitably Wednesday
 

461
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,590
is inevitably Wednesday
tomorrow. It is

462
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:10,600
tomorrow. It is
 

463
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,069
tomorrow. It is
inevitably impossible for the beginner

464
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
inevitably impossible for the beginner
 

465
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,790
inevitably impossible for the beginner
to do what I can

466
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:15,800
to do what I can
 

467
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,910
to do what I can
do. Therefore, what they're being taught

468
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
do. Therefore, what they're being taught
 

469
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,269
do. Therefore, what they're being taught
is what they can

470
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:22,279
is what they can
 

471
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,990
is what they can
do. What they're being taught then is

472
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
do. What they're being taught then is
 

473
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,910
do. What they're being taught then is
not the end

474
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:28,920

all or the once and for all. They have

476
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
all or the once and for all. They have
 

477
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,590
all or the once and for all. They have
to let go of what they've been shown in

478
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
to let go of what they've been shown in
 

479
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,150
to let go of what they've been shown in
order to continue to

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,509
diplomatically. If we're doing math,
this is like, you're really dumb. I'm

488
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
this is like, you're really dumb. I'm
 

489
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,470
this is like, you're really dumb. I'm
going to have to teach you how to count

490
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,480
going to have to teach you how to count
 

491
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,590
going to have to teach you how to count
first. Counting is not the whole of

492
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,600

 

493
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,590

math. We moved on. Now, there's not even

494
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
math. We moved on. Now, there's not even
 

495
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,949
math. We moved on. Now, there's not even
any numbers in our freaking equations. I

496
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
any numbers in our freaking equations. I
 

497
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,509
any numbers in our freaking equations. I
can't have you freaking out over where

498
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
can't have you freaking out over where
 

499
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,069
can't have you freaking out over where
the all the numbers are and how come

500
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
the all the numbers are and how come
 

501
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,269
the all the numbers are and how come
three isn't after two right now. This is

502
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
three isn't after two right now. This is
 

503
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,829
three isn't after two right now. This is
let

504
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
let
 

505
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,150
let
go. So, when we first learn the forward

506
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,160
go. So, when we first learn the forward
 

507
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,790
go. So, when we first learn the forward
roll, the biggest difficulty for the

508
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:21,800
roll, the biggest difficulty for the
 

509
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,829
roll, the biggest difficulty for the
person is the hip vertical plane.

510
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
person is the hip vertical plane.
 

511
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,670
person is the hip vertical plane.
They will constantly roll

512
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:30,680
They will constantly roll
 

513
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,389
They will constantly roll
around the knee and the

514
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:33,399
around the knee and the
 

515
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,750
around the knee and the
foot and roll onto their

516
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:36,760
foot and roll onto their
 

517
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,910
foot and roll onto their
side. The reason for this is when the

518
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
side. The reason for this is when the
 

519
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,550
side. The reason for this is when the
uncultivated

520
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:43,560
uncultivated
 

521
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,430
uncultivated
mind is spiral

522
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:46,440
mind is spiral
 

523
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,470
mind is spiral
rotated, it goes

524
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,480
rotated, it goes
 

525
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,030
rotated, it goes
into a

526
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,040
into a
 

527
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,509
into a
confoundedness. It loses where it is in

528
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
confoundedness. It loses where it is in
 

529
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,110
confoundedness. It loses where it is in
space.

530
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
space.
 

531
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,470
space.
It's I say it's there's a moment of

532
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,480
It's I say it's there's a moment of
 

533
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,030
It's I say it's there's a moment of
unconsciousness in the middle of the

534
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,040
unconsciousness in the middle of the
 

535
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,870
unconsciousness in the middle of the
role. The

536
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:03,880
role. The
 

537
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,150
role. The
desi knows where they are at the

538
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
desi knows where they are at the
 

539
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,550
desi knows where they are at the
beginning of the role and knows where

540
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
beginning of the role and knows where
 

541
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,629
beginning of the role and knows where
they are at the end of the role but has

542
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
they are at the end of the role but has
 

543
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,670
they are at the end of the role but has
no awareness of what happened to them in

544
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
no awareness of what happened to them in
 

545
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,310
no awareness of what happened to them in
the middle of the role.

546
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
the middle of the role.
 

547
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,870
the middle of the role.
And so they are

548
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
And so they are
 

549
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,550
And so they are
unaware of how their hip came out of

550
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
unaware of how their hip came out of
 

551
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,189
unaware of how their hip came out of
that vertical plane and how they came

552
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
that vertical plane and how they came
 

553
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,110
that vertical plane and how they came
about rolling on their

554
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,120
about rolling on their
 

555
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,870
about rolling on their
side. We can go to Adam's video. In

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,230
recently new or relatively new Iikidoka.
And you see her doing exactly this. Her

564
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
And you see her doing exactly this. Her
 

565
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,590
And you see her doing exactly this. Her
hip comes out of the vertical plane of

566
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
hip comes out of the vertical plane of
 

567
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,509
hip comes out of the vertical plane of
the the quad, knee, foot, and she ends

568
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
the the quad, knee, foot, and she ends
 

569
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,269
the the quad, knee, foot, and she ends
up rolling on her side.

570
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
up rolling on her side.
 

571
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,510
up rolling on her side.
She is thereby. The problem with this is

572
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
She is thereby. The problem with this is
 

573
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,990
She is thereby. The problem with this is
when she does this, she does not

574
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
when she does this, she does not
 

575
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,669
when she does this, she does not
generate the bottom apex nor is she able

576
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
generate the bottom apex nor is she able
 

577
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,110
generate the bottom apex nor is she able
to pass the bottom apex on the vertical

578
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
to pass the bottom apex on the vertical
 

579
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,350
to pass the bottom apex on the vertical
plane at the shoulder and that's where

580
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
plane at the shoulder and that's where
 

581
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,990
plane at the shoulder and that's where
they get

582
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
they get
 

583
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,150
they get
injured. As she's trying to do this, she

584
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
injured. As she's trying to do this, she
 

585
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,710
injured. As she's trying to do this, she
never realizes that you're just hurting

586
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
never realizes that you're just hurting
 

587
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,390
never realizes that you're just hurting
yourself on the shoulder, but she

588
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
yourself on the shoulder, but she
 

589
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,549
yourself on the shoulder, but she
realizes it hurts. And now she hates

590
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
realizes it hurts. And now she hates
 

591
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,190
realizes it hurts. And now she hates
rolling even more and she doesn't want

592
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
rolling even more and she doesn't want
 

593
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,590
rolling even more and she doesn't want
want to do

594
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,600
want to do
 

595
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,710
want to do
it. So we have to fix the hip

596
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:39,720
it. So we have to fix the hip
 

597
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,350
it. So we have to fix the hip
alignment so that they learn how to not

598
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
alignment so that they learn how to not
 

599
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,270
alignment so that they learn how to not
stack on the

600
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,280

 

601
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,110

making this or this is being made more

604
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
making this or this is being made more
 

605
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,510
making this or this is being made more
difficult for us because the newer

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
difficult for us because the newer
 

607
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,390
difficult for us because the newer
dashes goes unconscious when they get

622
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
awareness on where the hip is so that
 

623
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,669
awareness on where the hip is so that
they can stop stacking the

624
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:18,679
they can stop stacking the
 

625
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,190
they can stop stacking the
shoulders. That looks like this. This is

626
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
shoulders. That looks like this. This is
 

627
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,990
shoulders. That looks like this. This is
how we teach it. We start on the small

628
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
how we teach it. We start on the small
 

629
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,950
how we teach it. We start on the small
forward roll because they're going to in

630
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
forward roll because they're going to in
 

631
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,549
forward roll because they're going to in
they're injuring themselves. That is

632
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
they're injuring themselves. That is
 

633
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,750
they're injuring themselves. That is
what they're doing. They're injuring

634
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
what they're doing. They're injuring
 

635
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,669
what they're doing. They're injuring
themselves every rep. So, as I tell my

636
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
themselves every rep. So, as I tell my
 

637
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,789
themselves every rep. So, as I tell my
senpai here, do not spend all class

638
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
senpai here, do not spend all class
 

639
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,870
senpai here, do not spend all class
trying to get new people how to roll.

640
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
trying to get new people how to roll.
 

641
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,070
trying to get new people how to roll.
You do a little bit and you move

642

You do a little bit and you move
 

643
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,470
You do a little bit and you move
on. Tell them about tenderizing. A

644
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
on. Tell them about tenderizing. A

on. Tell them about tenderizing. A
polite way of saying you're injuring

646
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:46,760
polite way of saying you're injuring
 

647
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,270
polite way of saying you're injuring
yourself. We do small forward rolls

648
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
yourself. We do small forward rolls
 

649
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,669
yourself. We do small forward rolls
because there's less inertia from the

650
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
because there's less inertia from the
 

651
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,110
because there's less inertia from the
fact that there's not as much

652
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
fact that there's not as much
 

653
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,950
fact that there's not as much
gravitational force coming down.

654
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
gravitational force coming down.
 

655
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,909
gravitational force coming down.
This also helps them with their

656
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
This also helps them with their
 

657
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,870
This also helps them with their
unconsciousness because part of their

658
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
unconsciousness because part of their
 

659
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,510
unconsciousness because part of their
unconsciousness is that fear of falling.

660
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
unconsciousness is that fear of falling.
 

661
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,350
unconsciousness is that fear of falling.
So they're touching the mat. We let them

662
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
So they're touching the mat. We let them
 

663
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,669
So they're touching the mat. We let them
touch the

664
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:08,679

 

665
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,510

mat. We tell them to pay attention to

666
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
mat. We tell them to pay attention to
 

667
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,549
mat. We tell them to pay attention to
this line, this line with your front

668
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
this line, this line with your front
 

669
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,350
this line, this line with your front
knee and your front foot and your hip.

670
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
knee and your front foot and your hip.
 

671
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,270
knee and your front foot and your hip.
So, as they roll around, we want them to

672
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
So, as they roll around, we want them to
 

673
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,470
So, as they roll around, we want them to
trace their foot on the ceiling. That'll

674
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
trace their foot on the ceiling. That'll
 

675
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,190
trace their foot on the ceiling. That'll
guarantee that the knee stays in that

676
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
guarantee that the knee stays in that
 

677
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,190
guarantee that the knee stays in that
quad alignment as they're

678
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,200
quad alignment as they're
 

679
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,870
quad alignment as they're
going. And they come up like

680
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:35,880
going. And they come up like
 

681
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,990
going. And they come up like
this.

682
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,000

 

683
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,470

Again this way.

684
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
Again this way.
 

685
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,230
Again this way.
This was a

686
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,240

 

687
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,270

progression for somebody who is

688
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,280
progression for somebody who is
 

689
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,789
progression for somebody who is
still compromised by fear and subject to

690
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
still compromised by fear and subject to
 

691
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,110
still compromised by fear and subject to
moments of

692
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,120
moments of
 

693
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,669
moments of
unawareness. This is

694
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:56,679
unawareness. This is
 

695
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,390
unawareness. This is
not the

696
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,400
not the
 

697
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,310
not the
art. This is

698
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,320

 

699
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,870

counting. We have a problem and that is

700
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
counting. We have a problem and that is
 

701
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,590
counting. We have a problem and that is
the force equation. Mass times

702
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
the force equation. Mass times
 

703
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,789
the force equation. Mass times
acceleration equals force. What we're

704
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
acceleration equals force. What we're
 

705
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,789
acceleration equals force. What we're
trying to do is disperse mass off of

706
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
trying to do is disperse mass off of
 

707
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,830
trying to do is disperse mass off of
where the body makes contact with the

708
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:22,840
where the body makes contact with the
 

709
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,710
where the body makes contact with the
mat. By dispersing

710
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:25,720
mat. By dispersing
 

711
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,870
mat. By dispersing
force, there will by dispersing mass

712
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
force, there will by dispersing mass
 

713
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,470
force, there will by dispersing mass
there will be less force at those

714
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
there will be less force at those
 

715
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,510
there will be less force at those
points. As I already said, by lowering

716
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
points. As I already said, by lowering
 

717
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,070
points. As I already said, by lowering
the knee, like I said, we are decreasing

718
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
the knee, like I said, we are decreasing
 

719
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,710
the knee, like I said, we are decreasing
acceleration. And so our roles slow down

720
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
acceleration. And so our roles slow down
 

721
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,870
acceleration. And so our roles slow down
as they go. They don't speed up as they

722
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
as they go. They don't speed up as they
 

723
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,430
as they go. They don't speed up as they
go. And by slowing down as we go while

724
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
go. And by slowing down as we go while
 

725
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,830
go. And by slowing down as we go while
we're disseminating mass across the mat,

726
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
we're disseminating mass across the mat,
 

727
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,990
we're disseminating mass across the mat,
there's less force at impact. Now,

728
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
there's less force at impact. Now,
 

729
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,070
there's less force at impact. Now,
someone can actually pick me up off the

730
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
someone can actually pick me up off the
 

731
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,789
someone can actually pick me up off the
ground, throw me across the mat, and I

732
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
ground, throw me across the mat, and I
 

733
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,430
ground, throw me across the mat, and I
will not get hurt. If I pick up somebody

734
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
will not get hurt. If I pick up somebody
 

735
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,390
will not get hurt. If I pick up somebody
who's going to stack

736
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,400
who's going to stack
 

737
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,830
who's going to stack
mass, pick them up off the ground, throw

738
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
mass, pick them up off the ground, throw
 

739
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,830
mass, pick them up off the ground, throw
them across the mat, they're not going

740
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
them across the mat, they're not going
 

741
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,149
them across the mat, they're not going
to do that for very long, if even a

742
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
to do that for very long, if even a
 

743
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,310
to do that for very long, if even a
second time.

744
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,320

 

745
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,470

So, we throw them like that till they

746
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
So, we throw them like that till they
 

747
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,870
So, we throw them like that till they
get used to it in the next progression.

748
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
get used to it in the next progression.
 

749
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,110
get used to it in the next progression.
We let them do it. We don't do the X

750
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
We let them do it. We don't do the X
 

751
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,549
We let them do it. We don't do the X
patterns on them. Um, we don't do the

752
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
patterns on them. Um, we don't do the
 

753
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,270
patterns on them. Um, we don't do the
base displacements on them just to work

754
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
base displacements on them just to work
 

755
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,669
base displacements on them just to work
on these things, the fear, the

756
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:28,679
on these things, the fear, the
 

757
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,630
on these things, the fear, the
unconsciousness. But that's just a

758
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
unconsciousness. But that's just a
 

759
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,110
unconsciousness. But that's just a
progression, too. It's not an

760
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
progression, too. It's not an
 

761
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,510
progression, too. It's not an
application of the art. It's just

762
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
application of the art. It's just
 

763
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,510
application of the art. It's just
working on you.

764
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520

 

765
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,390

Now we're trying to more tackle once

766
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
Now we're trying to more tackle once
 

767
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,630
Now we're trying to more tackle once
they got that we start tackling what

768
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
they got that we start tackling what
 

769
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,669
they got that we start tackling what
that math is. Force times force is mass

770
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
that math is. Force times force is mass
 

771
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,669
that math is. Force times force is mass
times acceleration. Let's start working

772
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
times acceleration. Let's start working
 

773
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,470
times acceleration. Let's start working
with that decreased force at impact.

774
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
with that decreased force at impact.
 

775
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,470
with that decreased force at impact.
Towards that end we have the feet going

776
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
Towards that end we have the feet going
 

777
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,870
Towards that end we have the feet going
out that way. And now we start to throw

778
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
out that way. And now we start to throw
 

779
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,909
out that way. And now we start to throw
a little

780
00:21:58,909 --> 00:21:58,919
a little
 

781
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,590
a little
harder. That makes the feet go out that

782
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
harder. That makes the feet go out that
 

783
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,750
harder. That makes the feet go out that
way. And as I said, the person that

784
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
way. And as I said, the person that
 

785
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,230
way. And as I said, the person that
tries to do this progression will always

786
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
tries to do this progression will always
 

787
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,870
tries to do this progression will always
land on their hip. They just land on

788
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
land on their hip. They just land on
 

789
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,510
land on their hip. They just land on
their hip on a for on a front inward

790
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:12,520
their hip on a for on a front inward
 

791
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,230
their hip on a for on a front inward
kazushi. And they always have that

792
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,240
kazushi. And they always have that
 

793
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,470
kazushi. And they always have that
look because they still have the

794
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:17,480
look because they still have the
 

795
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,669
look because they still have the
unawareness. Okay, they're just waking

796
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
unawareness. Okay, they're just waking
 

797
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,270
unawareness. Okay, they're just waking
up. They didn't know what happened or

798
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
up. They didn't know what happened or
 

799
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,789
up. They didn't know what happened or
how they got there and they wake up at

800
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
how they got there and they wake up at
 

801
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,789
how they got there and they wake up at
the end of the

802
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:23,799
the end of the
 

803
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,470
the end of the
roll. I'm sure we have videos of that

804
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
roll. I'm sure we have videos of that
 

805
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,070
roll. I'm sure we have videos of that
where you could see the uk that

806
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
where you could see the uk that
 

807
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,549
where you could see the uk that
happening to them.

808
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:33,559

 

809
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,310

when we start speeding it

810
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,320
when we start speeding it
 

811
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,310
when we start speeding it
up. Aside from that, there is also a

812
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
up. Aside from that, there is also a
 

813
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,950
up. Aside from that, there is also a
very good reason on why you don't want

814
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
very good reason on why you don't want
 

815
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,710
very good reason on why you don't want
to do that anymore as the acceleration

816
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
to do that anymore as the acceleration
 

817
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,350
to do that anymore as the acceleration
increases from Nag. and that is that the

818
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
increases from Nag. and that is that the
 

819
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,710
increases from Nag. and that is that the
non rolling foot is going to slap on the

820
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:57,720
non rolling foot is going to slap on the
 

821
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,029
non rolling foot is going to slap on the
mat on this

mat on this
 

823
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,149
mat on this
part. So here I am doing that same

824
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:03,159
part. So here I am doing that same
 

825
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,789
part. So here I am doing that same
thing. We'll do it this

826
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:05,799
thing. We'll do it this
 

827
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,990
thing. We'll do it this
way. And as the non-rolling foot, boom,

828
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
way. And as the non-rolling foot, boom,
 

829
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,270
way. And as the non-rolling foot, boom,
it hits right there as it comes

830
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,280
