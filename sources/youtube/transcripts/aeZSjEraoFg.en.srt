around I'm also moving

172
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
around I'm also moving
 

173
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,029
around I'm also moving
across so I go from side Circle

174
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
across so I go from side Circle
 

175
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,310
across so I go from side Circle
and I

176
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
and I
 

177
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,150
and I
move back to the other side now he's not

178
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
move back to the other side now he's not
 

179
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,390
move back to the other side now he's not
on the distal side he's on the proximal

180
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,400
on the distal side he's on the proximal
 

181
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,310
on the distal side he's on the proximal
side so when I work the

182
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,320
side so when I work the
 

183
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,950
side so when I work the
technique he he's more falling

184
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
technique he he's more falling
 

185
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,590
technique he he's more falling
already if you need to you can always

186
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:20,600
already if you need to you can always
 

187
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,870
already if you need to you can always
move yourself again more and he'll have

188
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
move yourself again more and he'll have
 

189
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,189
move yourself again more and he'll have
even less Mass so the first point here

190
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
even less Mass so the first point here
 

191
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,909
even less Mass so the first point here
is a detail make sure he gets back to

192
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
is a detail make sure he gets back to
 

193
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,510
is a detail make sure he gets back to
the proximal side and move

194
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
the proximal side and move
 

195
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,029
the proximal side and move
yourself as well as move him in the gift

196
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
yourself as well as move him in the gift
 

197
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,629

is you can continually keep moving under

200
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
is you can continually keep moving under
 

201
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,670
is you can continually keep moving under
him so for whatever sweep it

202
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:50,680

 

203
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,830

is so let's say I got here he starts to

204
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
is so let's say I got here he starts to
 

205
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,430
is so let's say I got here he starts to
sit up I change SIDS and the same thing

206
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
sit up I change SIDS and the same thing
 

207
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,189
sit up I change SIDS and the same thing
even though I'm bringing them

208

on maybe my legs aren't strong enough
 

211
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,710
on maybe my legs aren't strong enough
okay I can again move me to the other

212
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
okay I can again move me to the other
 

213
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,230
okay I can again move me to the other
side and it'll be less Mass to

214
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
side and it'll be less Mass to
 

215
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,150
side and it'll be less Mass to
move third

216
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,160

his base narrow you can combine this
 

231
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,950
his base narrow you can combine this
with you moving out from under him and

232
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
with you moving out from under him and
 

233
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,309
with you moving out from under him and
he he's already off of you
