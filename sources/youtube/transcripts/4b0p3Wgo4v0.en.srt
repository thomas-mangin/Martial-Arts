okay we know first from o sensei's
 

167
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,429
okay we know first from o sensei's
writings that he referred to juji and

168
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:06,439
writings that he referred to juji and
 

169
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:13,069
writings that he referred to juji and
juji is uh this is this is how you write

170
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,079
juji is uh this is this is how you write
 

171
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,550
juji is uh this is this is how you write
the character for the number 10 in Kani

172
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:17,560
the character for the number 10 in Kani
 

173
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,189
the character for the number 10 in Kani
in Japanese and this J is number 10 and

174
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
in Japanese and this J is number 10 and
 

175
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,670
in Japanese and this J is number 10 and
G means character so the 10 character is

176
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
G means character so the 10 character is
 

177
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,270
G means character so the 10 character is
what juji means we in chibba Lage we

178
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
what juji means we in chibba Lage we
 

179
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,310
what juji means we in chibba Lage we
have juji G nag where the person's UK's

180
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
have juji G nag where the person's UK's
 

181
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,189
have juji G nag where the person's UK's
arm is across my arm perpendicular to it

182
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
arm is across my arm perpendicular to it
 

183
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,670
arm is across my arm perpendicular to it
and hence it makes a cross and hence

184
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
and hence it makes a cross and hence
 

185
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,950
and hence it makes a cross and hence
juji Net 10 characters from okay and we

186
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
juji Net 10 characters from okay and we
 

187
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,590
juji Net 10 characters from okay and we
know ensei referred to juji um and we

188
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600
know ensei referred to juji um and we
 

189
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,230
know ensei referred to juji um and we
know from Silk Road culture that the

190
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,240
know from Silk Road culture that the
 

191
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,350
know from Silk Road culture that the
internal Arts refer to this pattern and

192
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,360
internal Arts refer to this pattern and
 

193
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,749
internal Arts refer to this pattern and
this is actually why on the Silk Road

194
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
this is actually why on the Silk Road
 

195
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,510
this is actually why on the Silk Road
you see the

196
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
you see the
 

197
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,390
you see the
cross um everywhere across whether it's

198
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
cross um everywhere across whether it's
 

199
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,629
cross um everywhere across whether it's
OB obviously uh on the western end you

200
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:03,639
OB obviously uh on the western end you
 

201
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,510
OB obviously uh on the western end you
you understand Christianity has the

202
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
you understand Christianity has the
 

203
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,870
you understand Christianity has the
cross um knowing for a fact that uh C

204
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,880
cross um knowing for a fact that uh C
 

205
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,749
cross um knowing for a fact that uh C
crosses was not actually how Romans

206
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
crosses was not actually how Romans
 

207
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,430
crosses was not actually how Romans
crucified people okay um and then even

208
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
crucified people okay um and then even
 

209
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,990
crucified people okay um and then even
on the uh East End you see variations on

210
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
on the uh East End you see variations on
 

211
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,029
on the uh East End you see variations on
the cross if not outright the cross

212
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
the cross if not outright the cross
 

213
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,830
the cross if not outright the cross
okay um other things that you might see

214
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
okay um other things that you might see
 

215
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,550
okay um other things that you might see
is like this symbol uh the swastika

216
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
is like this symbol uh the swastika
 

217
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,150
is like this symbol uh the swastika
symbols you have the cross in there and

218
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,160
symbols you have the cross in there and
 

219
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,430
symbols you have the cross in there and
what this represents is uh a

220
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
what this represents is uh a
 

221
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,629
what this represents is uh a
diagrammatic form of yinong or dichotomy

222
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
diagrammatic form of yinong or dichotomy
 

223
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,550
diagrammatic form of yinong or dichotomy
or

224
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
or
 

225
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,629
or
dualistic um thinking that goes with the

226
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:51,639
dualistic um thinking that goes with the
 

227
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,710
dualistic um thinking that goes with the
Triune cosmology of silk road so you

228
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
Triune cosmology of silk road so you
 

229
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,029
Triune cosmology of silk road so you
have two things they're not really two

230
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
have two things they're not really two
 

231
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,430
have two things they're not really two
things there's a Oneness behind them all

232
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
things there's a Oneness behind them all
 

233
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,749
things there's a Oneness behind them all
and and it's represented with this kind

234
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
and and it's represented with this kind
 

235
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,550
and and it's represented with this kind
of Crossing okay even for

236
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
of Crossing okay even for
 

237
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,589
of Crossing okay even for
example um

238
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,599
example um
 

239
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,990
example um
in Judaism now we have this star of

240
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
in Judaism now we have this star of
 

241
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,150
in Judaism now we have this star of
David that people identify with Judaism

242
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
David that people identify with Judaism
 

243
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,950
David that people identify with Judaism
but this too is a yinyang symbol uh not

244
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:19,960
but this too is a yinyang symbol uh not
 

245
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,430
but this too is a yinyang symbol uh not
and you would see it outside of judaic

246
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,440
and you would see it outside of judaic
 

247
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,510
and you would see it outside of judaic

okay all right in iido if we understand

250
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
okay all right in iido if we understand

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,430
okay all right in iido if we understand
this we'll just use the East End

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
this we'll just use the East End
 

253
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,110
this we'll just use the East End

okay um an oppositional

272
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:05,479
okay um an oppositional
 

273
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,070
okay um an oppositional
energy is going to go in the opposite

274
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
energy is going to go in the opposite
 

275
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,550
energy is going to go in the opposite
direction right to left okay this would

276
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
direction right to left okay this would
 

277
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,029
direction right to left okay this would
be contestation this is a no no you

278
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
be contestation this is a no no you
 

279
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,430
be contestation this is a no no you
never do this in

280
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:18,440
never do this in

iido this however is how most modern

282
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
iido this however is how most modern

iido functions people will push on UK's

284
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
iido functions people will push on UK's
 

285
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,710
iido functions people will push on UK's
energy and here we have to understand

286
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:29,720
energy and here we have to understand
 

287
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,390
energy and here we have to understand
energy with either mass inertia or

288
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,400
energy with either mass inertia or
 

289
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,469
energy with either mass inertia or
momentum okay and we push on UK we

290
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
momentum okay and we push on UK we
 

291
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,550
momentum okay and we push on UK we
overcome the resistance of that energy

292
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
overcome the resistance of that energy
 

293
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,189
overcome the resistance of that energy
and now force it the other way this is

294
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
and now force it the other way this is
 

295
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,029
and now force it the other way this is
how most people understand iido today

296
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:46,039
how most people understand iido today
 

297
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,869
how most people understand iido today
but this is incorrect this is actually

298
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
but this is incorrect this is actually
 

299
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,189
but this is incorrect this is actually
contestation it is not non-c

300
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
contestation it is not non-c
 

301
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,029
contestation it is not non-c
contestation okay so we want to note

302
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:54,039
contestation okay so we want to note
 

303
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,710
contestation okay so we want to note
here we should not be contending we

304
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
here we should not be contending we
 

305
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,550
here we should not be contending we
should be non-c contesting and

306
00:07:59,550 --> 00:07:59,560
should be non-c contesting and
 

307
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,550
should be non-c contesting and
contention is when we are applying this

308
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
contention is when we are applying this
 

309
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,589
contention is when we are applying this
uh equal and opposite direction in the

310
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
uh equal and opposite direction in the
 

311
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,110
uh equal and opposite direction in the
effort to

312
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
effort to
 

313
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,790
effort to
overpower the force that's coming right

314
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,800
overpower the force that's coming right
 

315
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,710
overpower the force that's coming right
at us okay what we want to do instead in

316
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
at us okay what we want to do instead in
 

317
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,029
at us okay what we want to do instead in
iido let's keep this horizontal

318
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
iido let's keep this horizontal
 

319
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,950
iido let's keep this horizontal
energy is apply a uh Force to it at 90°

320
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
energy is apply a uh Force to it at 90°
 

321
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,230
energy is apply a uh Force to it at 90°
okay so instead of applying a 100 80°

322
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
okay so instead of applying a 100 80°
 

323
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,389
okay so instead of applying a 100 80°
counter Force to it we would apply

324
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
counter Force to it we would apply
 

325
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,070
counter Force to it we would apply
another Force coming in at this angle

326
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,080
another Force coming in at this angle
 

327
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,070
another Force coming in at this angle
okay and you can imagine just very

328
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
okay and you can imagine just very
 

329
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,750
okay and you can imagine just very
simply like a lever you're at the distal

330
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
simply like a lever you're at the distal
 

331
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,190
simply like a lever you're at the distal
end of the lever and this marker is

332
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
end of the lever and this marker is
 

333
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,470
end of the lever and this marker is
going this way and I'm going to push it

334
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:47,480
going this way and I'm going to push it
 

335
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,350
going this way and I'm going to push it
this way

336
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
this way
 

337
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,350
this way
okay this is a very very simple thing

338
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,360
okay this is a very very simple thing
 

339
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,350
okay this is a very very simple thing
that I'm doing so I I make this 90° here

340
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
that I'm doing so I I make this 90° here
 

341
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,470
that I'm doing so I I make this 90° here
what happens though as I start to turn

342
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
what happens though as I start to turn
 

343
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,030
what happens though as I start to turn
this Force well you have to keep the 90°

344
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
this Force well you have to keep the 90°
 

345
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,990
this Force well you have to keep the 90°
so as you're doing this with this Force

346
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
so as you're doing this with this Force
 

347
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,430
so as you're doing this with this Force
this force is now going like this you

348
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
this force is now going like this you
 

349
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,030
this force is now going like this you
have to keep that 90° going to that

350
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,040
have to keep that 90° going to that
 

351
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,230
have to keep that 90° going to that
Force as it's going around and so these

352
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,240
Force as it's going around and so these
 

353
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,310
Force as it's going around and so these
two lines which if you overextended it

354
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
two lines which if you overextended it
 

355
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,470
two lines which if you overextended it
do you

356
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
do you
 

357
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,069
do you
see start to rotate this way okay and

358
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:25,079
see start to rotate this way okay and
 

359
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,829
see start to rotate this way okay and
that's why it is the cross and we're

360
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:28,839
that's why it is the cross and we're
 

361
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,430
that's why it is the cross and we're
rotating it all right why do I call it

362
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
rotating it all right why do I call it
 

363
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,310
rotating it all right why do I call it
spiral spiraling

364
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,320
spiral spiraling
 

365
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,030
spiral spiraling
because we have to have the third

366
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
because we have to have the third
 

367
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,910
because we have to have the third
dimension uh which is not drawable here

368
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
dimension uh which is not drawable here
 

369
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,269
dimension uh which is not drawable here
on this whiteboard and as you start to

370
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:46,279
on this whiteboard and as you start to
 

371
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,910
on this whiteboard and as you start to
start this this cross spiral or rotating

372
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:50,920
start this this cross spiral or rotating
 

373
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,829
start this this cross spiral or rotating
when you allow for the Third Dimension

374
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839
when you allow for the Third Dimension
 

375
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,030
when you allow for the Third Dimension
the whole cross now starts to spiral

376
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,040
the whole cross now starts to spiral
 

377
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,750
the whole cross now starts to spiral
through space and hence it is a spiral

378
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:58,760
through space and hence it is a spiral
 

379
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,030
through space and hence it is a spiral
rotation

380
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,040
rotation
 

381
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,430
rotation
that we're constantly seeking as we seek

382
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
that we're constantly seeking as we seek
 

383
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,350
that we're constantly seeking as we seek
a 90° angle constantly to uh UK Mass

384
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
a 90° angle constantly to uh UK Mass
 

385
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,870
a 90° angle constantly to uh UK Mass
imersa momentum okay we never

386
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:13,880
imersa momentum okay we never
 

387
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,069
imersa momentum okay we never
push uh in opposition to it that's what

388
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:17,079
push uh in opposition to it that's what
 

389
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,030
push uh in opposition to it that's what
we're doing so again this is a cultural

390
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
we're doing so again this is a cultural
 

391
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,030
we're doing so again this is a cultural
abstraction of those two cosmological

392
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,040
abstraction of those two cosmological
 

393
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,069
abstraction of those two cosmological
forces okay and then uh we have here

394
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
forces okay and then uh we have here
 

395
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,990
forces okay and then uh we have here
okay let's apply what we we know about

396
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
okay let's apply what we we know about
 

397
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,870
okay let's apply what we we know about
these two cosmological forces and so

398
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
these two cosmological forces and so
 

399
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,949
these two cosmological forces and so
that we produce non-c contestation and

400
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:35,959
that we produce non-c contestation and
 

401
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,509
that we produce non-c contestation and
what that is is that we're going to do

402
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:38,519
what that is is that we're going to do
 

403
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,870
what that is is that we're going to do
this constant we're going to do a 90°

404
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:41,880
this constant we're going to do a 90°
 

405
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,430
this constant we're going to do a 90°
angle to whatever Force Vector we're

406
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:44,440
angle to whatever Force Vector we're
 

407
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,629
angle to whatever Force Vector we're
dealing with that Force Vector in this

408
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:46,639
dealing with that Force Vector in this
 

409
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,670
dealing with that Force Vector in this
case is representative of ukas mass

410
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
case is representative of ukas mass
 

411
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,509
case is representative of ukas mass
inertia momentum okay uh the opposite

412
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
inertia momentum okay uh the opposite
 

413
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,670
inertia momentum okay uh the opposite
again the contention angle would be that

414
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:56,680
again the contention angle would be that
 

415
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,750
again the contention angle would be that
we're here and we're making this 180

416
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
we're here and we're making this 180
 

417
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,710
we're here and we're making this 180
okay all

418
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:01,720
okay all
 

419
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,550
okay all
right as we apply this in practice

420
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:05,560
right as we apply this in practice
 

421
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,910
right as we apply this in practice
however uh this is a constant thing it

422
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
however uh this is a constant thing it
 

423
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,350
however uh this is a constant thing it
can't be this simple

424
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
can't be this simple
 

425
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,670
can't be this simple
abstract you know two lines it's a

426
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:14,680
abstract you know two lines it's a
 

427
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,150
abstract you know two lines it's a
constant 90° to the mass inertia and

428
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
constant 90° to the mass inertia and
 

429
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,790
constant 90° to the mass inertia and
momentum of UK and so you have this

430
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
momentum of UK and so you have this
 

431
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,310
momentum of UK and so you have this
rotation that is happening and then

432
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
rotation that is happening and then
 

433
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,430
rotation that is happening and then
because there's a third dimension this

434
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,440
because there's a third dimension this
 

435
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,750
because there's a third dimension this
is actually going either down or it's

436
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:28,760
is actually going either down or it's
 

437
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,910
is actually going either down or it's
going up up as it's traversing also

438
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
going up up as it's traversing also
 

439
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,069
going up up as it's traversing also
across the mat and so you have to kind

440
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
across the mat and so you have to kind
 

441
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,269
across the mat and so you have to kind
of visualize this as a spiral a

442
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
of visualize this as a spiral a
 

443
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,509
of visualize this as a spiral a
spiraling pattern okay that's what we

444
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
spiraling pattern okay that's what we
 

445
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,190
spiraling pattern okay that's what we
just discussed the other thing we want

446
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,200
just discussed the other thing we want
 

447
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,470
just discussed the other thing we want
to understand is because within this

448
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480
to understand is because within this
 

449
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,790
to understand is because within this
pattern there is a circularity to it

450
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
pattern there is a circularity to it
 

451
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,030
pattern there is a circularity to it
okay and an important thing to note is

452
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
okay and an important thing to note is
 

453
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,190
okay and an important thing to note is
that a circle has two side two sides to

454
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,200
that a circle has two side two sides to
 

455
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,310
that a circle has two side two sides to
it in a way um I

456
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
it in a way um I
 

457
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,629
it in a way um I
and what we want to draw out of this is

458
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:03,639
and what we want to draw out of this is
 

459
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,430
and what we want to draw out of this is
anything that is going forward so in

460
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,440
anything that is going forward so in
 

461
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,430
anything that is going forward so in
this case from left to right can be made

462
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
this case from left to right can be made
 

463
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,150
this case from left to right can be made
to go back right to left without it

464
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,160
to go back right to left without it
 

465
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,629
to go back right to left without it
reversing okay so we use this circle to

466
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:17,639
reversing okay so we use this circle to
 

467
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,430
reversing okay so we use this circle to
take energy that's coming left to right

468
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440
take energy that's coming left to right
 

469
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,470
take energy that's coming left to right
let's say in this case and we will round

470
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,480
let's say in this case and we will round
 

471
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,829
let's say in this case and we will round
this keeping the

472
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
this keeping the
 

473
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,470
this keeping the
body going in the forward motion but now

474
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,480
body going in the forward motion but now
 

475
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,230
body going in the forward motion but now
headed in the opposite direction okay

476
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
headed in the opposite direction okay
 

477
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,030
headed in the opposite direction okay
what would be different from the from

478
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
what would be different from the from
 

479
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,110
what would be different from the from
that is this contention model where I

480
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,120
that is this contention model where I
 

481
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,430
that is this contention model where I
now try to overpower it do you see and

482
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
now try to overpower it do you see and
 

483
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,430
now try to overpower it do you see and
now this force over overpowered is also

484
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
now this force over overpowered is also
 

485
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,550
now this force over overpowered is also
heading in that direction that's we

486
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,560
heading in that direction that's we
 

487
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,829
heading in that direction that's we

and I generate centrifugal energy or
 

567
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,749
and I generate centrifugal energy or
centripetal energy also very important

okay you have to remember that this 90

570
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,560
okay you have to remember that this 90
 

571
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,670
okay you have to remember that this 90
is a

572
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:00,680
is a
 

573
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,230
is a
constant um 90° application okay and

574
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
constant um 90° application okay and
 

575
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,110
constant um 90° application okay and
that means that in particular when iido

576
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,120
that means that in particular when iido
 

577
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,829
that means that in particular when iido
uses cental energy for pinning and

578
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
uses cental energy for pinning and
 

579
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,269
uses cental energy for pinning and
centrifugal energy for

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
centrifugal energy for
 

581
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,870
centrifugal energy for
throwing and I have to generate these

582
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
throwing and I have to generate these
 

583
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,629

forces within a constant application of
 

585
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,030
forces within a constant application of
90° the only way you can do that is that

586
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
90° the only way you can do that is that
 

587
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,309
90° the only way you can do that is that
from your single contact point

588
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:30,319
from your single contact point
 

589
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,790
from your single contact point
you can generate this constant 90°

590
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:35,800
you can generate this constant 90°
 

591
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,509
you can generate this constant 90°
variation that means internal

592

for the updating 90° and they now hit
the 180 and they just overpower the 180

650
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
the 180 and they just overpower the 180
 

651
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,350
the 180 and they just overpower the 180
and that's why um you UK look so

652
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:14,360
and that's why um you UK look so
 

653
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,470
and that's why um you UK look so
different on how you're thrown and how

654
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
different on how you're thrown and how
 

655
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,189
different on how you're thrown and how
you fall versus other UK who can do um

656
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
you fall versus other UK who can do um
 

657
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,390
you fall versus other UK who can do um
all their crazy front Brak Falls right

658
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
all their crazy front Brak Falls right
 

659
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,590
all their crazy front Brak Falls right
in the same vertical plane for example

660
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
in the same vertical plane for example
 

661
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,590
in the same vertical plane for example
they're not hit with the x pattern or in

662
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:28,600
they're not hit with the x pattern or in
 

663
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,669
they're not hit with the x pattern or in
some some cases uh the back breakfall

664
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
some some cases uh the back breakfall
 

665
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,710
some some cases uh the back breakfall
they can just sit their butt down or

666
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,720
they can just sit their butt down or
 

667
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,870
they can just sit their butt down or
even do a back somersault or back

668
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:35,880
even do a back somersault or back
 

669
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,990
even do a back somersault or back
backwards roll which is totally

670
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
backwards roll which is totally
 

671
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,990
backwards roll which is totally
impossible for how we Throw because this

672
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,000
impossible for how we Throw because this
 

673
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,590
impossible for how we Throw because this
is constantly being modulated and your

674
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
is constantly being modulated and your
 

675
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,430
is constantly being modulated and your
body itself is spiral rotating okay

676
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
body itself is spiral rotating okay
 

677
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,590
body itself is spiral rotating okay
which is what makes it very very hard to

678
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
which is what makes it very very hard to
 

679
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,470
which is what makes it very very hard to
become skilled in our ukemi style

680
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
become skilled in our ukemi style
 

681
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,549
become skilled in our ukemi style
because it is balls scary as

682
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
because it is balls scary as
 

683
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,350
because it is balls scary as
okay right and most of us can't uh

684
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
okay right and most of us can't uh
 

685
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,710
okay right and most of us can't uh
reconcile that amount of fear and so

686
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:01,720
reconcile that amount of fear and so
 

687
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,870
reconcile that amount of fear and so
what do we have to do we have to go back

688
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
what do we have to do we have to go back
 

689
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,789
what do we have to do we have to go back
to this model which allows you to just

690
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
to this model which allows you to just
 

691
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,190
to this model which allows you to just
go backwards or go forward okay which is

692
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,200
go backwards or go forward okay which is
 

693
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,830
go backwards or go forward okay which is
not really the art okay all

694
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
not really the art okay all
 

695
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,070
not really the art okay all
right okay um so we'll just work from

696
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,080
right okay um so we'll just work from
 

697
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,029
right okay um so we'll just work from
here oh I me sorry IH okay so we'll just

698
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
here oh I me sorry IH okay so we'll just
 

699
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,029
here oh I me sorry IH okay so we'll just
work from IH because I that's what you

700
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
work from IH because I that's what you
 

701
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,070
work from IH because I that's what you
were working from okay I'm not going to

702
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
were working from okay I'm not going to
 

703
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,270
were working from okay I'm not going to
go into this stuff I just want to go

704
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
go into this stuff I just want to go
 

705
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,669
go into this stuff I just want to go
into this non-c contestation so I I

706
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
into this non-c contestation so I I
 

707
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,029
into this non-c contestation so I I
don't I'm not going to go into the

708
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
don't I'm not going to go into the
 

709
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,430
don't I'm not going to go into the
um um tabaki okay I'm not going to go

710
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:42,440
um um tabaki okay I'm not going to go
 

711
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,430
um um tabaki okay I'm not going to go
in um but you guys see for yourself that

712
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
in um but you guys see for yourself that
 

713
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,270
in um but you guys see for yourself that
I'm going to I'm going to move

714
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280

 

715
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,630

him as opposed to him staying there and

716
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
him as opposed to him staying there and
 

717
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,230
him as opposed to him staying there and
then me going around

718
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240

 

719
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,950

so I moved him you see the difference

720
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:05,960

 

721
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,310

Okay because I'm going to use circles

722
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,320
Okay because I'm going to use circles
 

723
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,870
Okay because I'm going to use circles
okay I don't I just take figure that out

724
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
okay I don't I just take figure that out
 

725
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,549
okay I don't I just take figure that out
you can figure that out it looks totally

726
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
you can figure that out it looks totally
 

727
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:22,990
you can figure that out it looks totally
different does it not looks totally

728
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,000

 

729
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:37,590

different totally different okay right

730
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600

 

731
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,669

right okay

732
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:40,679
right okay
 

733
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,630
right okay
um but I want to look

734
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
um but I want to look
 

735
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,270
um but I want to look
at the energy that I start to use to

736
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,280
at the energy that I start to use to
 

737
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,990
at the energy that I start to use to
take him down okay so however I got

738
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,000
take him down okay so however I got
 

739
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,230
take him down okay so however I got
there you could

740
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,240
there you could
 

741
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,470
there you could
see that his energy is either was either

742
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,480
see that his energy is either was either
 

743
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,789
see that his energy is either was either
going to go forward in my version or it

744
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
going to go forward in my version or it
 

745
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,549
going to go forward in my version or it
staying still okay face me

746
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:07,559
staying still okay face me
 

747
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,430
staying still okay face me
again even staying

748
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,440
again even staying
 

749
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,630
again even staying
still has mass and inertia

750
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:17,640

 

751
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,909

okay so that is a force and all I'm

752
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:22,919
okay so that is a force and all I'm
 

753
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,190
okay so that is a force and all I'm
doing here is Supply what its

754
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,200
doing here is Supply what its
 

755
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,230
doing here is Supply what its
force is going up down do you guys

756
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,240
force is going up down do you guys
 

757
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,510
force is going up down do you guys
understand that okay and all I am trying

758
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,520
understand that okay and all I am trying
 

759
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,549
understand that okay and all I am trying
to do is shove it down that's all I'm

760
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
to do is shove it down that's all I'm
 

761
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,750
to do is shove it down that's all I'm
trying to do if I could I smash him down

762
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
trying to do if I could I smash him down
 

763
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,669
trying to do if I could I smash him down
like that you see but I

764
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:44,679
like that you see but I
 

765
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,909
like that you see but I
can't so I smashing it

766
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
can't so I smashing it
 

767
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,590
can't so I smashing it
down just enough where I can't do it

768
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:50,600
down just enough where I can't do it
 

769
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,470
down just enough where I can't do it
anymore and that's what causes him to

770
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:53,480
anymore and that's what causes him to
 

771
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,070
anymore and that's what causes him to
turn Okay And now when you add my

772
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,080
turn Okay And now when you add my
 

773
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,470
turn Okay And now when you add my
movement to that

774
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,480
movement to that
 

775
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,230
movement to that
stay there I don't want you to move when

776
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
stay there I don't want you to move when
 

777
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,909
stay there I don't want you to move when
you add my movement to that that's what

778
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:04,919
you add my movement to that that's what
 

779
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,870
you add my movement to that that's what
makes this pulling do you

780
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880

 

781
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,669

see now if I brought him forward then I

782
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:14,679
see now if I brought him forward then I
 

783
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,070
see now if I brought him forward then I
be pull on the backward then then the

784
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
be pull on the backward then then the
 

785
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,269
be pull on the backward then then the
the contention is obvious

786
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:21,279
the contention is obvious
 

787
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,029
the contention is obvious
okay but there's another way to do this

788
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
okay but there's another way to do this
 

789
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,470
okay but there's another way to do this
and that is I position myself within the

790
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,480
and that is I position myself within the
 

791
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,630
and that is I position myself within the
Circle and I have his

792
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
Circle and I have his
 

793
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,750
Circle and I have his
Mass going up and down and now going

794
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
Mass going up and down and now going
 

795
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,750
Mass going up and down and now going
forward okay because I would have the

796
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
forward okay because I would have the
 

797
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,710
forward okay because I would have the
two uh Force vectors in my version of

798
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:41,720
two uh Force vectors in my version of
 

799
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,190
two uh Force vectors in my version of
the technique

800
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
the technique
 

801
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,950
the technique
okay and I'm going to position myself in

802
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
okay and I'm going to position myself in
 

803
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,430
okay and I'm going to position myself in
a place that when he goes I I'll do it

804
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,440
a place that when he goes I I'll do it
 

805
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,909
a place that when he goes I I'll do it
here physically when he goes forward say

806
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:54,919
here physically when he goes forward say
 

807
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,310
here physically when he goes forward say
that when he goes

808
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,320
that when he goes
 

809
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,470
that when he goes
forward go go forward that it holds him

810
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
forward go go forward that it holds him
 

811
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,070
forward go go forward that it holds him
here

812
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,080
here
 

813
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,230
here
then when he is staying still at the

814
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
then when he is staying still at the
 

815
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,789
then when he is staying still at the
same time the energy that has him

816
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
same time the energy that has him
 

817
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,310
same time the energy that has him
staying still right um I am going to

818
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,320
staying still right um I am going to
 

819
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,950
staying still right um I am going to
allow it to turn it's very hard to do

820
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:17,960
allow it to turn it's very hard to do
 

821
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,950
allow it to turn it's very hard to do
from here because of the slack that you

822
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
from here because of the slack that you
 

823
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,470
from here because of the slack that you
have there energy is spilling out all

824
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,480
have there energy is spilling out all
 

825
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,070
have there energy is spilling out all
over the place okay but once I come to

826
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,080
over the place okay but once I come to
 

827
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,149
over the place okay but once I come to
to the

828
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:31,159
to the
 

829
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,430
to the
adhesion okay and I want you to feel

830
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
adhesion okay and I want you to feel
 

831
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,470
adhesion okay and I want you to feel
that okay and he goes forward then I can

832
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:37,480
that okay and he goes forward then I can
 

833
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,470
that okay and he goes forward then I can
keep cutting these little increments

834
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
keep cutting these little increments
 

835
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,190
keep cutting these little increments
those n constant 90° angle to what he's

836
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,200
those n constant 90° angle to what he's
 

837
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,990
those n constant 90° angle to what he's
doing okay so here again if he tries to

838
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
doing okay so here again if he tries to
 

839
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,510
doing okay so here again if he tries to
go forward I keep taking it that way he

840
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
go forward I keep taking it that way he
 

841
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,590
go forward I keep taking it that way he
tries to go forward I take it 90° he

842
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:54,600
tries to go forward I take it 90° he
 

843
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,470
tries to go forward I take it 90° he
tries to go forward and I take it 90°

844
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:57,480
tries to go forward and I take it 90°
 

845
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,830
tries to go forward and I take it 90°
and it's easy

846
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
and it's easy
 

847
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,669
and it's easy
okay so that's that's why I keep him

848
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
okay so that's that's why I keep him
 

849
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,990
okay so that's that's why I keep him
moving and it's easy

850
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000

 

851
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,950

peasy

852
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960

 

853
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,669

whoa and you cannot do that externally I

854
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:22,679
whoa and you cannot do that externally I
 

855
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,990
whoa and you cannot do that externally I
could do it here but now I start losing

856
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,000
could do it here but now I start losing
 

857
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,669
could do it here but now I start losing
it you see I I got it from here to here

858
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:28,679
it you see I I got it from here to here
 

859
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,909
it you see I I got it from here to here
here but now when he goes forward we're

860
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
here but now when he goes forward we're
 

861
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,350
here but now when he goes forward we're
on the 180 do you see okay and so that's

862
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,360
on the 180 do you see okay and so that's
 

863
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,230
on the 180 do you see okay and so that's
where I just show

864
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,240
where I just show
 

865
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,190
where I just show
that were you able to get that does that

866
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,200
that were you able to get that does that
 

867
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,390
that were you able to get that does that
make sense okay so instead I do start

868
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,400
make sense okay so instead I do start
 

869
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,549
make sense okay so instead I do start
him rotating but I just keep that 90

870
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:51,559

 

871
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,149

going which means I have to constantly

872
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
going which means I have to constantly
 

873
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:08,350
going which means I have to constantly
turn

874
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,360

 

875
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,269

okay now back to that uh centripetal

876
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:12,279
okay now back to that uh centripetal
 

877
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,549
okay now back to that uh centripetal
energy here okay so I need him to keep

878
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
energy here okay so I need him to keep
 

879
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,830
energy here okay so I need him to keep
going forward if I stop this and I'm

880
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
going forward if I stop this and I'm
 

881
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,110
going forward if I stop this and I'm
just using the 90 90 you can do that

882
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,120
just using the 90 90 you can do that
 

883
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,950
just using the 90 90 you can do that
okay but I'm going to lose

884
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960

 

885
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,549

him so I need him to keep going forward

886
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
him so I need him to keep going forward
 

887
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,230
him so I need him to keep going forward
and get that balance

888
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,240
and get that balance
 

889
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,470
and get that balance
going is what I

890
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:37,480

 

891
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,990

want then you just stay with

892
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,000
want then you just stay with
 

893
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,630
want then you just stay with
it so on the one example I'm

894
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:45,640
it so on the one example I'm
 

895
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,870
it so on the one example I'm
demonstrating the the the the inertia

896
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
demonstrating the the the the inertia
 

897
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,510
demonstrating the the the the inertia
that I'm using

898
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
that I'm using
 

899
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,710
that I'm using
there sorry

900
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:53,720
there sorry
 

901
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,470
there sorry
not but that cental energy and now all I

902
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
not but that cental energy and now all I
 

903
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,190
not but that cental energy and now all I
here stay with

904
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,200
here stay with
 

905
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,110
here stay with
it then I'm

906
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,120

 

907
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,070

here room stay with it stay with

908
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
here room stay with it stay with
 

909
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,789
here room stay with it stay with
it

910
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:09,799
it
 

911
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,310
it
okay it's different

912
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
okay it's different
 

913
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,430
okay it's different
from I'm here and I pull him me

914
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,440
from I'm here and I pull him me
 

915
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,070
from I'm here and I pull him me
different I stay with what was happening

916
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
different I stay with what was happening
 

917
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,870
different I stay with what was happening
in the correct way and this other thing

918
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
in the correct way and this other thing
 

919
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,630
in the correct way and this other thing
I'm making it happen by just over power

920
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm making it happen by just over power
 

921
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,269
I'm making it happen by just over power
in

922
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:30,279
in
 

923
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,470
in
okay so just as I have to move

924
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
okay so just as I have to move
 

925
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,070
okay so just as I have to move
myself such that I can continue the

926
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
myself such that I can continue the
 

927
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,510
myself such that I can continue the
90° to

928
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:40,520
90° to
 

929
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,230
90° to
your

930
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
your
 

931
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,590
your
energy I have to also be in this right

932
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
energy I have to also be in this right
 

933
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,070
energy I have to also be in this right
place time in order to capitalize upon

934
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,080
place time in order to capitalize upon
 

935
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,269

the Cent the cental energy of my I
 

937
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,549
the Cent the cental energy of my I
adhesion okay try to again couple key

938
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
adhesion okay try to again couple key
 

939
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,190
adhesion okay try to again couple key
differences here in order to generate

940
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
differences here in order to generate
 

941
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,750
differences here in order to generate
everything we're talking about is what I

942
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
everything we're talking about is what I
 

943
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,070
everything we're talking about is what I
actually need them to keep going forward

944
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
actually need them to keep going forward
 

945
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,909
actually need them to keep going forward
I I can't have them stay

946
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:08,919

 

947
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,590

still because even if I apply

948
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,600
still because even if I apply
 

949
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,669
still because even if I apply
90 on the same adhesion Point

950
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
90 on the same adhesion Point
 

951
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,190
90 on the same adhesion Point
eventually I'm going to start right

952
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,200
eventually I'm going to start right
 

953
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,430
eventually I'm going to start right
about here I'm now pulling this thing

954
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
about here I'm now pulling this thing
 

955
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,669
about here I'm now pulling this thing
back to me

956
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:26,679
back to me
 

957
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,149
back to me
okay which is OB when you watch the ghee

958
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
okay which is OB when you watch the ghee
 

959
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,190
okay which is OB when you watch the ghee
okay so as I watch the ghee true that is

960
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
okay so as I watch the ghee true that is
 

961
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,669
okay so as I watch the ghee true that is
a 90 but now if I keep going 90 he's

962
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:36,679
a 90 but now if I keep going 90 he's
 

963
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,950
a 90 but now if I keep going 90 he's
going to go away from me you see and at

964
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
going to go away from me you see and at
 

965
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,750
going to go away from me you see and at
a certain point you'll watch his ghe you

966
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:40,760
a certain point you'll watch his ghe you
 

967
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,230
a certain point you'll watch his ghe you
see how the ghe comes back cuz I'm

968
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,240
see how the ghe comes back cuz I'm
 

969
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,669
see how the ghe comes back cuz I'm
pulling on him

970
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
pulling on him
 

971
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,110
pulling on him
okay so key key difference is the Uka

972
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
okay so key key difference is the Uka
 

973
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,909
okay so key key difference is the Uka
does have to keep going forward

974
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
does have to keep going forward
 

975
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,350
does have to keep going forward
okay another key difference here is that

976
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
okay another key difference here is that
 

977
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,230
okay another key difference here is that
I don't stop moving uh and the UK

978
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't stop moving uh and the UK
 

979
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,510
I don't stop moving uh and the UK
doesn't stop moving we all keep

980
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:00,520
doesn't stop moving we all keep
 

981
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,909
doesn't stop moving we all keep
moving so when the UK stops moving I

982
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
moving so when the UK stops moving I
 

983
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,470
moving so when the UK stops moving I
don't move the UK and I come around you

984
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
don't move the UK and I come around you
 

985
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,510
don't move the UK and I come around you
see he didn't move and now I move now he

986
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
see he didn't move and now I move now he
 

987
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,029
see he didn't move and now I move now he
moves and in the other one we all keep

988
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
moves and in the other one we all keep
 

989
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,230
moves and in the other one we all keep
moving at the same time that's another

990
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
moving at the same time that's another
 

991
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,630
moving at the same time that's another
key difference to telling you am I doing

992
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
key difference to telling you am I doing
 

993
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,950
key difference to telling you am I doing
this or am I not doing this that is

994
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
this or am I not doing this that is
 

995
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,909
this or am I not doing this that is
observable from a third party okay at

996
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
observable from a third party okay at
 

997
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,149
observable from a third party okay at
this point what is observable to him is

998
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,159
this point what is observable to him is
 

999
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,789
this point what is observable to him is
he can feel the

1000
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
he can feel the
 

1001
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,310
he can feel the

1002
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
adhesion gaining this centripetal energy
 

1003
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,389

00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:42,279
place time within the circle that I'm
 

1007
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,269

generating he he feels that that kind of

1008
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
generating he he feels that that kind of
 

1009
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,110
generating he he feels that that kind of
thing on him imagine if you had good we

had a better camera and they focused on

1012
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:50,679
had a better camera and they focused on
 

1013
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,509
had a better camera and they focused on
that you would see it on his face but

1014
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:53,519
that you would see it on his face but
 

1015
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,750
that you would see it on his face but
he's able to feel it

1016
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:55,760
he's able to feel it
 

1017
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,750
he's able to feel it
okay um

1018
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
okay um
 

1019
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,149
okay um
something

1020
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:01,159
something
 

1021
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,830
something
else is my hand again I remember I said

1022
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:06,840
else is my hand again I remember I said
 

1023
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,950
else is my hand again I remember I said
that

1024
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
that
 

1025
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,909
that
uh it's more that I stay up with it

1026
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
uh it's more that I stay up with it
 

1027
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,710
uh it's more that I stay up with it
versus I put him underneath me I stay up

1028
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
versus I put him underneath me I stay up
 

1029
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,549
versus I put him underneath me I stay up
with it which follows my rule that I'm

1030
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:17,559
with it which follows my rule that I'm
 

1031
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,909
with it which follows my rule that I'm
just aiming a fallen body I'm not

1032
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:19,919
just aiming a fallen body I'm not
 

1033
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,070
just aiming a fallen body I'm not
throwing him down okay so a as we're

1034
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,080
throwing him down okay so a as we're
 

1035
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,389
throwing him down okay so a as we're
moving and I get it I you won't see

1036
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
moving and I get it I you won't see
 

1037
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,990
moving and I get it I you won't see
this

1038
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
this
 

1039
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,710
this
stuff you won't see that and he doesn't

1040
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
stuff you won't see that and he doesn't
 

1041
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,870
stuff you won't see that and he doesn't
feel that either right like if he comes

1042
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:35,880
feel that either right like if he comes
 

1043
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,310
feel that either right like if he comes
uh in other words do you feel that

difference okay that difference okay
this is what you feel right cuz at this

1048

this is what you feel right cuz at this
 

1049
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,110
this is what you feel right cuz at this
point he would fall out of dead hean

1050
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
point he would fall out of dead hean
 

1051
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,950
point he would fall out of dead hean
because I'm not going to do this okay

1052
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:49,960
because I'm not going to do this okay
 

1053
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,789
because I'm not going to do this okay
but because of the C he he can't you

1054
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:53,799
but because of the C he he can't you
 

1055
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,990
but because of the C he he can't you
can't lift straight up go ahead you

1056
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,000
can't lift straight up go ahead you
 

1057
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,789
can't lift straight up go ahead you
can't lift straight up where whereas

00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
can't lift straight up where whereas
 

1059
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,590
can't lift straight up where whereas
strangely as I go like this and I'm just

1060
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,600
strangely as I go like this and I'm just
 

1061
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,110
strangely as I go like this and I'm just
here you can push up you see get it so

1062
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
here you can push up you see get it so
 

1063
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,909
here you can push up you see get it so
you look for that like your ukas should

1064
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
you look for that like your ukas should
 

1065
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,710
you look for that like your ukas should
not feel smashed at the bottom they

1066
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
not feel smashed at the bottom they
 

1067
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,870
not feel smashed at the bottom they
should feel like I can get up

1068
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:13,880
should feel like I can get up
 

1069
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,830
should feel like I can get up
okay so as you're watching that you can

1070
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
okay so as you're watching that you can
 

1071
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,430
okay so as you're watching that you can
see like here at the bottom I'm just

1072
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
see like here at the bottom I'm just
 

1073
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,470
see like here at the bottom I'm just
maintaining light contact my I'm not

1074
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,480
maintaining light contact my I'm not
 

1075
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,110
maintaining light contact my I'm not
here he's not under me

1076
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
here he's not under me
 

1077
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,029
here he's not under me
do you see he's here

1078
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
do you see he's here
 

1079
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,750
do you see he's here
okay so we'll go

1080
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:36,760
okay so we'll go
 

1081
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:44,310
okay so we'll go
again just it's light at that point okay

1082
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320

 

1083
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,230

um this is what allows me to do

1084
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,240
um this is what allows me to do
 

1085
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,590
um this is what allows me to do
something that after I get going a while

1086
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
something that after I get going a while
 

1087
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,509
something that after I get going a while
I I end up doing it I'm not even sure I

1088
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:51,519
I I end up doing it I'm not even sure I
 

1089
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,230
I I end up doing it I'm not even sure I
can do it consciously but I end up

1090
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,240
can do it consciously but I end up
 

1091
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,590
can do it consciously but I end up
turning around again okay

1092
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:58,600
turning around again okay
 

1093
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,990
turning around again okay
because I'm not pinning him down at that

1094
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,000
because I'm not pinning him down at that
 

1095
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,590
because I'm not pinning him down at that
point so we go

1096
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
point so we go
 

1097
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,950
point so we go
around and I'm over

1098
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
around and I'm over
 

1099
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,549
around and I'm over
here not over here see this

1100
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
here not over here see this
 

1101
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,789
here not over here see this
difference

1102
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:17,799

 

1103
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,190

so see where I

1104
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,200
so see where I
 

1105
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,389
so see where I
am I'm going to be over

1106
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:25,399

 

1107
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,789

here instead

1108
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799

 

1109
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,909

no I'll keep 10 coning up up

1110
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
no I'll keep 10 coning up up
 

1111
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,590
no I'll keep 10 coning up up
up will'll be here okay either

1112
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:40,600
up will'll be here okay either
 

1113
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,110
up will'll be here okay either
way if I don't ten

1114
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
way if I don't ten
 

1115
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,870
way if I don't ten
conon this hand is

1116
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:45,880
conon this hand is
 

1117
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,750
conon this hand is
light if I do t con again this hand is

1118
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
light if I do t con again this hand is
 

1119
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,509
light if I do t con again this hand is
light but light does not mean he can

1120
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:52,519
light but light does not mean he can
 

1121
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,149
light but light does not mean he can
pick it up he count you can try count

1122
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:57,159
pick it up he count you can try count
 

1123
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,870
pick it up he count you can try count
this is same Cy extension okay and now

1124
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:01,880
this is same Cy extension okay and now
 

1125
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,629
this is same Cy extension okay and now
the beauty of this

1126
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:03,639
the beauty of this
 

1127
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,029
the beauty of this
technique is I just applied the rotating

1128
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:08,039
technique is I just applied the rotating
 

1129
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,669
technique is I just applied the rotating
cross

1130
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
cross
 

1131
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,669
cross
horizontally and now I'm going to apply

1132
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
horizontally and now I'm going to apply
 

1133
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,990
horizontally and now I'm going to apply
it vertically okay which fits with the

1134
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
it vertically okay which fits with the
 

1135
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,870
it vertically okay which fits with the
Triune cosmology you have to do both

1136
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:19,880
Triune cosmology you have to do both
 

1137
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,350
Triune cosmology you have to do both
okay so we going around one way boom and

1138
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,360
okay so we going around one way boom and
 

1139
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,950
okay so we going around one way boom and
now I take that

1140
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:25,960
now I take that
 

1141
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,230
now I take that
verticality okay so when he tries to

1142
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
verticality okay so when he tries to
 

1143
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,310
verticality okay so when he tries to
come up I don't try to shove him down I

1144
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,320
come up I don't try to shove him down I
 

1145
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,470
come up I don't try to shove him down I
don't try to grab him and pull him and

1146
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:35,480
don't try to grab him and pull him and
 

1147
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,310
don't try to grab him and pull him and
if he is choreographed to go forward I'm

1148
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
if he is choreographed to go forward I'm
 

1149
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,590
if he is choreographed to go forward I'm
not worried about him coming

1150
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:40,600
not worried about him coming
 

1151
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,190
not worried about him coming
up okay because there was no pressure

1152
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,200
up okay because there was no pressure
 

1153
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,750
up okay because there was no pressure
let's go back to where you were because

1154
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:46,760
let's go back to where you were because
 

1155
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,310
let's go back to where you were because
there was no pressure he'll he should

1156
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,320
there was no pressure he'll he should
 

1157
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,870
there was no pressure he'll he should
feel the yin space which means he should

1158
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:51,880
feel the yin space which means he should
 

1159
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,310
feel the yin space which means he should
try to come

1160
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,320
try to come
 

1161
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,350
try to come
up okay and that means I have a force

1162
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:58,360
up okay and that means I have a force
 

1163
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,909
up okay and that means I have a force
going this way well that means I apply

1164
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
going this way well that means I apply
 

1165
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,269
going this way well that means I apply
that ever modulating 90° he comes up and

1166
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,279
that ever modulating 90° he comes up and
 

1167
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,629
that ever modulating 90° he comes up and
I just keep bringing it

1168
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:08,639
I just keep bringing it
 

1169
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,110
I just keep bringing it
forward it looks like he's

1170
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
forward it looks like he's
 

1171
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,669
forward it looks like he's
crawling he is because if he doesn't put

1172
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
crawling he is because if he doesn't put
 

1173
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,230
crawling he is because if he doesn't put
his hands forward he would fall again

1174
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
his hands forward he would fall again
 

1175
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,990
his hands forward he would fall again
okay

1176
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,000
okay
 

1177
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,789
okay
um let's just get there okay leave your

1178
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:23,799
um let's just get there okay leave your
 

1179
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,190
um let's just get there okay leave your
hands where they are and come up

1180
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,200
hands where they are and come up
 

1181
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,389
hands where they are and come up
so he puts his hands there as he tries

1182
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:31,399
so he puts his hands there as he tries
 

1183
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,950
so he puts his hands there as he tries
to come up or it he puts his hands there

1184
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:35,960
to come up or it he puts his hands there
 

1185
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,789
to come up or it he puts his hands there
okay this down okay but how I'm moving

1186
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
okay this down okay but how I'm moving
 

1187
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,629
okay this down okay but how I'm moving
him is the adhesion will come back into

1188
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:43,639
him is the adhesion will come back into
 

1189
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,990
him is the adhesion will come back into
place okay so for yes yes as he tries to

1190
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,000
place okay so for yes yes as he tries to
 

1191
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,750
place okay so for yes yes as he tries to
come up you can do that okay that's

1192
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
come up you can do that okay that's
 

1193
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,070
come up you can do that okay that's
still the 90° but eventually as he goes

1194
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
still the 90° but eventually as he goes
 

1195
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,070
still the 90° but eventually as he goes
up and he moves in I'm now in the a

1196
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
up and he moves in I'm now in the a
 

1197
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,389
up and he moves in I'm now in the a
place where I got to now pull him okay

1198
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
place where I got to now pull him okay
 

1199
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,269
place where I got to now pull him okay
or shove him down cuz he's going to

1200
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:04,279
or shove him down cuz he's going to
 

1201
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,430
or shove him down cuz he's going to
stand up all the way okay but with the

1202
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
stand up all the way okay but with the
 

1203
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,870
stand up all the way okay but with the
adhesion as he goes up he he being moved

1204
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:11,880
adhesion as he goes up he he being moved
 

1205
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,549
adhesion as he goes up he he being moved
and I'll show you what I mean by

1206
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
and I'll show you what I mean by
 

1207
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,029
and I'll show you what I mean by
that okay um don't don't come forward

1208
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
that okay um don't don't come forward
 

1209
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,350
that okay um don't don't come forward
don't come forward you got it and I'm

1210
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
don't come forward you got it and I'm
 

1211
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,590
don't come forward you got it and I'm
just using that adhesion to move him

1212
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:24,600
just using that adhesion to move him
 

1213
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,909
just using that adhesion to move him
forward okay and it's just as he comes

1214
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
forward okay and it's just as he comes
 

1215
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,430
forward okay and it's just as he comes
up I'm also applying that 90° modulation

1216
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,440
up I'm also applying that 90° modulation
 

1217
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,470
up I'm also applying that 90° modulation
but it's done with a adhesion so that

1218
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:35,480
but it's done with a adhesion so that
 

1219
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,789
but it's done with a adhesion so that
when he comes up and I move him

1220
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:39,799
when he comes up and I move him
 

1221
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,549
when he comes up and I move him
around I can keep the ever modulating 90

1222
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:43,559
around I can keep the ever modulating 90
 

1223
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,269
around I can keep the ever modulating 90
Dees Fuller until the circle now

1224
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:46,279
Dees Fuller until the circle now
 

1225
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,789
Dees Fuller until the circle now
reverses itself he's going forward but

1226
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
reverses itself he's going forward but
 

1227
00:33:48,799 --> 00:34:03,830
reverses itself he's going forward but
he's actually going the other way okay

1228
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840

 

1229
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,669

okay so you're doing it

1230
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:06,679
okay so you're doing it
 

1231
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:16,030
okay so you're doing it
twice boom here

1232
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,040

 

1233
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,430

boom okay let's try it and you have that

1234
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
boom okay let's try it and you have that
 

1235
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,589
boom okay let's try it and you have that
same need to be in the right place time

1236
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:22,599
same need to be in the right place time
 

1237
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,030
same need to be in the right place time
the right wind wear in order to generate

1238
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
the right wind wear in order to generate
 

1239
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,389
the right wind wear in order to generate
this cental energy on the vertical

1240
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
this cental energy on the vertical
 

1241
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,550
this cental energy on the vertical
and the way that you do this is the

1242
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:31,560
and the way that you do this is the
 

1243
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,190
and the way that you do this is the
energy tells you where to move you don't

1244
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,200
energy tells you where to move you don't
 

1245
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,430
energy tells you where to move you don't
move the UK to where you want to go so

1246
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:36,440
move the UK to where you want to go so
 

1247
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,030
move the UK to where you want to go so
first let me show you uh what happens

1248
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
first let me show you uh what happens
 

1249
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,310
first let me show you uh what happens
when we move the UK to where we want to

1250
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:41,320
when we move the UK to where we want to
 

1251
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,430
when we move the UK to where we want to
go okay so I'm coming around here and

1252
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:44,440
go okay so I'm coming around here and
 

1253
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,869
go okay so I'm coming around here and
then here and here okay and in that

1254
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:49,879
then here and here okay and in that
 

1255
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,430
then here and here okay and in that
eventually you're going to not be 90° to

1256
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,440
eventually you're going to not be 90° to
 

1257
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,710
eventually you're going to not be 90° to
their mass inertia momentum and you're

1258
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:55,720
their mass inertia momentum and you're
 

1259
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,470
their mass inertia momentum and you're
just pulling in this case or pushing

1260
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
just pulling in this case or pushing
 

1261
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,470
just pulling in this case or pushing
eventually and now you're contesting

1262
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
eventually and now you're contesting
 

1263
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,349
eventually and now you're contesting
what's going on okay um sometimes what

1264
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:04,359
what's going on okay um sometimes what
 

1265
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,190
what's going on okay um sometimes what
happens on my Desy hair as you're

1266
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,200
happens on my Desy hair as you're
 

1267
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,710
happens on my Desy hair as you're
getting all this going is you just you

1268
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:08,720
getting all this going is you just you
 

1269
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,710
getting all this going is you just you
lose the connection here go ahead and uh

1270
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:11,720
lose the connection here go ahead and uh
 

1271
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,030
lose the connection here go ahead and uh
you're like over here well you shouldn't

1272
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,040
you're like over here well you shouldn't
 

1273
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,270
you're like over here well you shouldn't
have stepped here this energy told you

1274
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:16,280
have stepped here this energy told you
 

1275
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,790
have stepped here this energy told you
to step here you see okay so you have to

1276
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
to step here you see okay so you have to
 

1277
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,109
to step here you see okay so you have to
put yourself where the energy can keep

1278
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:24,119
put yourself where the energy can keep
 

1279
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,550
put yourself where the energy can keep
its constant

1280
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:25,560
its constant
 

1281
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,630
its constant
90° modulation okay

1282
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:31,640

 

1283
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,349

right I can't let you go and I'm over

1284
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
right I can't let you go and I'm over
 

1285
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,069
right I can't let you go and I'm over
here and I'm pulling you into this thing

1286
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:39,079
here and I'm pulling you into this thing
 

1287
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,950
here and I'm pulling you into this thing
I keep the energy that I feel keep

1288
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
I keep the energy that I feel keep
 

1289
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,630
I keep the energy that I feel keep
that so that I'm always there for the

1290
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:47,640
that so that I'm always there for the
 

1291
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,790
that so that I'm always there for the
throw okay again some differences that

1292
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:51,800
throw okay again some differences that
 

1293
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,630
throw okay again some differences that
you'll

1294
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
you'll
 

1295
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,630
you'll
see is we'll get to this part

1296
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
see is we'll get to this part
 

1297
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,390
see is we'll get to this part
is the the hand on the neck is the

1298
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
is the the hand on the neck is the
 

1299
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,550
is the the hand on the neck is the
dominant throwing hand

1300
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:05,560
dominant throwing hand
 

1301
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,870
dominant throwing hand
until you reach the yinyang transition

1302
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:09,880
until you reach the yinyang transition
 

1303
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,710
until you reach the yinyang transition
which happens at 12:00 okay instead what

1304
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
which happens at 12:00 okay instead what
 

1305
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,349
which happens at 12:00 okay instead what
you'll see is he comes up and this hand

1306
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:18,359
you'll see is he comes up and this hand
 

1307
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,589
you'll see is he comes up and this hand
is the dominant hand and you start grows

1308
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:22,599
is the dominant hand and you start grows
 

1309
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,150
is the dominant hand and you start grows
like that okay because this hand has the

1310
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
like that okay because this hand has the
 

1311
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,790
like that okay because this hand has the
adhesion point when he goes

1312
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
adhesion point when he goes
 

1313
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,870
adhesion point when he goes
forward and he comes up here this hand's

1314
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:31,880
forward and he comes up here this hand's
 

1315
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,069
forward and he comes up here this hand's
doing all of that it's not till at this

1316
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,079
doing all of that it's not till at this
 

1317
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,030
doing all of that it's not till at this
point the energy that I was bringing

1318
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
point the energy that I was bringing
 

1319
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,589
point the energy that I was bringing
down and around I would now be pulling

1320
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
down and around I would now be pulling
 

1321
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,829
down and around I would now be pulling
at 90° to at at 180 to his wanting to

1322
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
at 90° to at at 180 to his wanting to
 

1323
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,710
at 90° to at at 180 to his wanting to
stay up do you see so that is when this

1324
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:53,720
stay up do you see so that is when this
 

1325
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,950
stay up do you see so that is when this
hat now takes over and when it takes

1326
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:56,960
hat now takes over and when it takes
 

1327
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,710
hat now takes over and when it takes
over

1328
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
over
 

1329
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,990
over
it doesn't go down it goes here he

1330
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,000
it doesn't go down it goes here he
 

1331
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,829
it doesn't go down it goes here he
doesn't want to go down to this energy

1332
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:04,839
doesn't want to go down to this energy
 

1333
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,910
doesn't want to go down to this energy
goes this

1334
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:06,920
goes this
 

1335
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,589
goes this
way keeps that 90° going okay so

1336
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
way keeps that 90° going okay so
 

1337
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,670
way keeps that 90° going okay so
you'll see what that looks like here it

1338
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:14,680
you'll see what that looks like here it
 

1339
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:24,770
you'll see what that looks like here it
is and then up this way

1340
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:24,780

okay it doesn't have anything to do with
how many times you ten con or if you ten
