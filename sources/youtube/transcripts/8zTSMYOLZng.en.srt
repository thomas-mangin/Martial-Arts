um that angle of cancellation in the
 

153
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,010
um that angle of cancellation in the
other joints it controls a lot of that

154

other joints it controls a lot of that

person uh cross laterally as well okay
and the shoulder doesn't do that all the

158
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,020
and the shoulder doesn't do that all the
 

159
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,810
and the shoulder doesn't do that all the
time because it's a ball and socket

160
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,820
time because it's a ball and socket
 

161
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,790
time because it's a ball and socket
joint and then you have very similar

162
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
joint and then you have very similar
 

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,950

stuff on the wrist the elbow does not

stuff on the wrist the elbow does not
 

165

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,590
see this and then you chase this thing
on the back side and it just doesn't

180
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:06,600
on the back side and it just doesn't
 

181
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,370
on the back side and it just doesn't
happen it only happens in la la land of

182
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,380
happen it only happens in la la land of
 

183
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,450
happen it only happens in la la land of
a bad keyhonawanda so as it goes up

184
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,460
a bad keyhonawanda so as it goes up
 

185
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,010
a bad keyhonawanda so as it goes up
you're here

186
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,020
you're here
 

187
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,249
you're here
you're in the same spot okay

188
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,259
you're in the same spot okay
 

189
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,650
you're in the same spot okay
so your tegatana is at this angle

190
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,660
so your tegatana is at this angle
 

191
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,529
so your tegatana is at this angle
deflection stay there please which is

192
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:27,539
deflection stay there please which is
 

193
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,650
deflection stay there please which is
nothing more than your inner spiral stop

194
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
nothing more than your inner spiral stop
 

195
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,830
nothing more than your inner spiral stop
there carry over we go to Eco change

196
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
there carry over we go to Eco change
 

197
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,110
there carry over we go to Eco change
which side I'm forward and let me give

198
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
which side I'm forward and let me give
 

199
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,330
which side I'm forward and let me give
me nothing

200
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,340
me nothing
 

201
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,529

here

202
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
here
 

203
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,670
here
okay that angle deflection is going to

204
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
okay that angle deflection is going to
 

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,870
okay that angle deflection is going to
generate

206
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880

 

207
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,390

here's a kind of spillage over so I'll

208
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
here's a kind of spillage over so I'll
 

209
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,150
here's a kind of spillage over so I'll
just just show it with your hand you can

210
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,160
just just show it with your hand you can
 

211
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,730
just just show it with your hand you can
see this diagonal here forget what my

212
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:55,740
see this diagonal here forget what my
 

213
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,510
see this diagonal here forget what my
body's doing okay and as he slides down

214
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
body's doing okay and as he slides down
 

215
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,570
body's doing okay and as he slides down
it moves It Off by line

216
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,580
it moves It Off by line
 

217
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,189
it moves It Off by line
see that

218
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:04,199
see that
 

219
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,950
see that
so I have this diagonal here it's like a

220
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
so I have this diagonal here it's like a
 

221
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,029
so I have this diagonal here it's like a
rain gutter he goes and it misses me if

222
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
rain gutter he goes and it misses me if
 

223
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,590
rain gutter he goes and it misses me if
I'm here on the side and he goes down up

224
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm here on the side and he goes down up
 

225
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,330
I'm here on the side and he goes down up
you understand

226
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:17,340
you understand
 

227
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,029
you understand
okay

228
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
okay
 

229
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,089
okay
internally this movement is to this all

230
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:23,099
internally this movement is to this all
 

231
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,790
internally this movement is to this all
the time in Temple uh it's very common

232
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
the time in Temple uh it's very common
 

233
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,430
the time in Temple uh it's very common
it's a instead of hitting that spot

234
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
it's a instead of hitting that spot
 

235
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,249
it's a instead of hitting that spot
as in your internal

236
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
as in your internal
 

237
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,430
as in your internal
in your inward spiral the tiger can hit

238
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,440
in your inward spiral the tiger can hit
 

239
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,850
in your inward spiral the tiger can hit
it this way okay uh obviously as I said

240
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,860
it this way okay uh obviously as I said
 

241
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,249
it this way okay uh obviously as I said
it could be an angle of deflection but

242
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:40,259
it could be an angle of deflection but
 

243
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,589
it could be an angle of deflection but
things coming down but you can also hit

244
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:42,599
things coming down but you can also hit
 

245
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,089
things coming down but you can also hit
with it

246
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:44,099
with it
 

247
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,330
with it
forearm this way okay

248
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340

 

249
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,189

let's go

250
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
let's go
 

251
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,570
let's go
so when I adhere and I'm in his Center

252
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:53,580
so when I adhere and I'm in his Center
 

253
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,990
so when I adhere and I'm in his Center
when he pushes down it makes his whole

254
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,000
when he pushes down it makes his whole
 

255
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,409
when he pushes down it makes his whole
body go off the line you understand that

256
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:00,419
body go off the line you understand that
 

257
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,689
body go off the line you understand that
and over here stocking into it's not

258
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:02,699
and over here stocking into it's not
 

259
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,370
and over here stocking into it's not
going to do that this is this very

260
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:04,380
going to do that this is this very
 

261
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,070
going to do that this is this very
awkward position for me okay

262
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
awkward position for me okay
 

263
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,249
awkward position for me okay
and that angled deflection yeah

264
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:10,259
and that angled deflection yeah
 

265
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,550
and that angled deflection yeah
is connected here which you see again is

266
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,560
is connected here which you see again is
 

267
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,770
is connected here which you see again is
another inward spiral

268
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:15,780
another inward spiral
 

269
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,249
another inward spiral
and I'm here so the same thing as I'm

270
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:19,259
and I'm here so the same thing as I'm
 

271
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,770
and I'm here so the same thing as I'm
working internally as you push this down

272
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:21,780
working internally as you push this down
 

273
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,710
working internally as you push this down
it'll move him off the line of the cap

274
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
it'll move him off the line of the cap
 

275
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,430
it'll move him off the line of the cap
okay that is important because I don't

276
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
okay that is important because I don't
 

277
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:36,350
okay that is important because I don't
have to now go around the line of attack

278
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,360

 

279
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,909

without clashing with him okay

280
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919
without clashing with him okay
 

281
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,969
without clashing with him okay
in this technique as he goes up and I

282
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:43,979
in this technique as he goes up and I
 

283
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,570
in this technique as he goes up and I
come here once I feel that that is where

284
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:47,580
come here once I feel that that is where
 

285
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,020
come here once I feel that that is where
I get out of the way

286
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,030
I get out of the way
 

287
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,329
I get out of the way

do it again
he goes up I need he pushes down and I

292
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,260
he goes up I need he pushes down and I
 

293
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,050
he goes up I need he pushes down and I
move out of the way now if you pay

294
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,060
move out of the way now if you pay
 

295
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,970
move out of the way now if you pay
attention

296
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:58,980
attention
 

297
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,350
attention
watch what happens to his body in that

298
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
watch what happens to his body in that
 

299
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,110
watch what happens to his body in that
entire process

300
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,120
entire process
 

301
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,050
entire process
you see his he went that way a little do

302
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,060
you see his he went that way a little do
 

303
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,850
you see his he went that way a little do
it again

304
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:13,860

 

305
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,530

you see his name

306
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:15,540
you see his name
 

307
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:23,329
you see his name
you see that and here is the opening

308
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:23,339

 

309
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,949

go back up

310
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
go back up
 

311
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,650
go back up
put your knee perfectly straight you

312
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,660
put your knee perfectly straight you
 

313
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,590
put your knee perfectly straight you
could have your foot up okay it's not as

314
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,600
could have your foot up okay it's not as
 

315
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,790
could have your foot up okay it's not as
great

316
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:31,800
great
 

317
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,009
great
you see that put your knee back over

318
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:34,019
you see that put your knee back over
 

319
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,090
you see that put your knee back over
there

320
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,100

 

321
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,090

you can't do that on the side you can't

322
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,100
you can't do that on the side you can't
 

323
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,430
you can't do that on the side you can't
do that at all on the side

324
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
do that at all on the side
 

325
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,430
do that at all on the side
he's perfectly straight okay and I don't

326
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:46,440
he's perfectly straight okay and I don't
 

327
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,050
he's perfectly straight okay and I don't
even think you'd catch it in real life

328
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,060

 

329
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,210

second mistake

00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:56,279
as you're coming around
 

333
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,340
as you're coming around
you grab with this hand

the elbow is tight you feel that
 

533
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,930
the elbow is tight you feel that
pressure okay and I'm over here doing

let's try it again okay so uh my

let's try it again okay so uh my
 

575
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,550
let's try it again okay so uh my
philosophy on locking

576
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
philosophy on locking
 

577
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,269
philosophy on locking
um is that I'm not in the law I have the

578
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:56,279
um is that I'm not in the law I have the
 

579
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,150
um is that I'm not in the law I have the
lock but I'm not in the lock so just

580
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,160
lock but I'm not in the lock so just
 

581
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,449
lock but I'm not in the lock so just
like if I'm I'm over here on him I'm

582
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:02,459
like if I'm I'm over here on him I'm
 

583
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,189
like if I'm I'm over here on him I'm
actually in his Center

584
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,199
actually in his Center
 

585
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,170
actually in his Center
okay do you understand that so it

586
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,180
okay do you understand that so it
 

587
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,090
okay do you understand that so it
doesn't change if I'm in the if I'm in

588
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,100
doesn't change if I'm in the if I'm in
 

589
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,150
doesn't change if I'm in the if I'm in
the lock I'm actually in the center

590
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,160
the lock I'm actually in the center
 

591
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,970
the lock I'm actually in the center
okay the lock is used as an angle

592
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
okay the lock is used as an angle
 

593
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,910
okay the lock is used as an angle
cancellation so for example uh instead

594
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:16,920
cancellation so for example uh instead
 

595
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,590
cancellation so for example uh instead
of like trying to crank them down here

596
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:18,600
of like trying to crank them down here
 

597
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,110
of like trying to crank them down here
which I don't even think I can but I can

598
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
which I don't even think I can but I can
 

599
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,189
which I don't even think I can but I can
move his Center okay and now the block

600
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:24,199
move his Center okay and now the block
 

601
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,769
move his Center okay and now the block
will be an angle cancellation so if he

602
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:27,779
will be an angle cancellation so if he
 

603
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,769
will be an angle cancellation so if he
tries to get up it gives me time to do

604
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:30,779
tries to get up it gives me time to do
 

605
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,810
tries to get up it gives me time to do
something else but that's not what took

606
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:32,820
something else but that's not what took
 

607
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,430
something else but that's not what took
him down do you understand

608
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,440
him down do you understand
 

609
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,249
him down do you understand
say yes okay

610
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:36,259
say yes okay
 

611
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,329
say yes okay
but when you're working your locks

612
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:40,339
but when you're working your locks
 

613
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:43,550
but when you're working your locks
I think that you should always be able

614
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:43,560
I think that you should always be able
 

615
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,410
I think that you should always be able
to break something

616
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,420
to break something
 

617
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,310
to break something
okay so this thing is on

618
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:49,320
okay so this thing is on
 

619
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,030
okay so this thing is on
and I should be at a mechanical

620
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
and I should be at a mechanical
 

621
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,569
and I should be at a mechanical
advantage externally where I can snap

622
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:56,579
advantage externally where I can snap
 

623
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,230
advantage externally where I can snap
that thing okay so

624
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
that thing okay so
 

625
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,689
that thing okay so
what that looks like of course he feels

626
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:02,699
what that looks like of course he feels
 

627
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,929
what that looks like of course he feels
it but you try to watch my movement as

628
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:05,939
it but you try to watch my movement as
 

629
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,949
it but you try to watch my movement as
he wants to tap

630
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:09,959

 

631
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,890

that's a sign that your lock is right on

632
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:12,900
that's a sign that your lock is right on
 

633
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,409
that's a sign that your lock is right on
that edge there that you can't detect

634
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:15,419
that edge there that you can't detect
 

635
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,870
that edge there that you can't detect
the external pressure but he can feel

636
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
the external pressure but he can feel
 

637
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,549
the external pressure but he can feel
like nothing's gonna go

638
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,559
like nothing's gonna go
 

639
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:26,110
like nothing's gonna go
same thing if we're here

640
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,120

 

641
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,270

this lock should be

642
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
this lock should be
 

643
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,549
this lock should be
at such a way

644
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:31,559
at such a way
 

645
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,909
at such a way
that it's already on and the same thing

646
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:34,919
that it's already on and the same thing
 

647
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,630
that it's already on and the same thing
I I have so much range of motion that

648
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
I I have so much range of motion that
 

649
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,590
I I have so much range of motion that
just kind of inhaling

650

651
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,490

will get me there as opposed to this

652
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500
will get me there as opposed to this
 

653
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,430
will get me there as opposed to this
you see look how much I gotta go before

654
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
you see look how much I gotta go before
 

655
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,750

I even get there okay and when I'm here

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,169

of range of motion I have okay
 

667
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,850

same thing on this one

668
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860

 

669
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,570

I should not be at such an inferior

670
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,580
I should not be at such an inferior
 

671
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,750
I should not be at such an inferior
external mechanical advantage that all I

672
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
external mechanical advantage that all I
 

673
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,150
external mechanical advantage that all I
can get is the tap

674
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
can get is the tap
 

675
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,650
can get is the tap
I should be in a place where I can snap

676
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:24,660
I should be in a place where I can snap
 

677
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,110
I should be in a place where I can snap
that thing slowly and surely

678
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
that thing slowly and surely
 

679
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,150
that thing slowly and surely
do you see that difference

680
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,160
do you see that difference
 

681
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,400
do you see that difference
that's as hard as I can go

682
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,410
that's as hard as I can go
