this client still chunky and then you

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,220
this client still chunky and then you
 

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:19,460
this client still chunky and then you
send another vector over and outside but

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,470
send another vector over and outside but
 

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,250
send another vector over and outside but
if you pay attention you're taking their

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,260
if you pay attention you're taking their
 

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,970
if you pay attention you're taking their
center of gravity and you're creating a

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:25,980
center of gravity and you're creating a
 

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,500
center of gravity and you're creating a
spiral like this

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:27,510
spiral like this
 

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,500
spiral like this
and the spiral is so it goes down and it

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,510
and the spiral is so it goes down and it
 

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,180
and the spiral is so it goes down and it
starts to build up so terrific low

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,190
starts to build up so terrific low
 

15

93
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,000

so his body his center does not go in

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,010
so his body his center does not go in
 

95
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:11,830
so his body his center does not go in
and then back and I'm not sitting here

and then back and I'm not sitting here
 

97
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,039
and then back and I'm not sitting here
and show me him his head

98
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,049
and show me him his head
 

99
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,060
and show me him his head
creating some sort of angle of

creating some sort of angle of
 

101
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,070
creating some sort of angle of
disturbance with his head

102
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,080
disturbance with his head
 

103
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,400

well that front anymore position pattern
that handles this way the handle system

328
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:16,700
that handles this way the handle system
 

329
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,030
that handles this way the handle system
so you don't need to do the technique

330
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,040
so you don't need to do the technique
 

331
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,160
so you don't need to do the technique
and you definitely don't need it if he's

332
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,170
and you definitely don't need it if he's
 

333
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,370
and you definitely don't need it if he's
dissing dressing we don't need it you

334
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,380
dissing dressing we don't need it you
 

335
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,690
dissing dressing we don't need it you
see you could leave that all out on the

336
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:35,700
see you could leave that all out on the
 

337
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,200
see you could leave that all out on the
out on the back upward spiral behind

338
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,210
out on the back upward spiral behind
 

339
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,310
out on the back upward spiral behind
does not go this way the hand goes this

340
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:43,320
does not go this way the hand goes this
 

341
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,350
does not go this way the hand goes this
way this way the front did work this way

342
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360
way this way the front did work this way
 

343
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,550
way this way the front did work this way
the back outward this way

344
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:51,560
the back outward this way
 

345
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,040
the back outward this way
you get it see a lot of you go like this

346
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,050
you get it see a lot of you go like this
 

347
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,290
you get it see a lot of you go like this
we just try and knock on that

348
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,300
we just try and knock on that
 

349
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,800
we just try and knock on that
don't try to knock them down what goes

350
00:13:59,800 --> 00:13:59,810
don't try to knock them down what goes
 

351
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,379
don't try to knock them down what goes
this way I mean here it's not a

352
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:05,389
this way I mean here it's not a
 

353
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:17,070
this way I mean here it's not a
free-for-all boom no here

354
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,080

 

355
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:33,389

is that removing all the top

356
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399

 

357
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,910

so he's gonna try to get his foot back

358
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:36,920
so he's gonna try to get his foot back
 

359
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:59,500
so he's gonna try to get his foot back
down he's gonna get his foot down if I

360
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,510
down he's gonna get his foot down if I
 

361
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,579
down he's gonna get his foot down if I
don't new pattern okay sit down okay if

362
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:03,589
don't new pattern okay sit down okay if
 

363
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,120

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,130
I do tired he was actually gonna forward
 

365
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:15,940
I do tired he was actually gonna forward
he's going forward he's not going out he

366

okay
play with that then you feel that you

390
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:54,259
play with that then you feel that you
 

391
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,439
play with that then you feel that you
weren't honest with is that you have to

you what push it on you want it to not

396
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:03,649
you what push it on you want it to not
 

397
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:06,309
you what push it on you want it to not
pay attention to it so here's where you

398
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:06,319
pay attention to it so here's where you
 

399
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,680
pay attention to it so here's where you
go and then you're like I'm going to do

400
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:08,690
go and then you're like I'm going to do
 

401
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,600
go and then you're like I'm going to do
that look now you're pushing on him

402
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:12,610
that look now you're pushing on him
 

403
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:19,720
that look now you're pushing on him
you're just the musician if you pay

404
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:19,730
you're just the musician if you pay
 

405
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,329
you're just the musician if you pay
attention actually happens before my

406
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:22,339
attention actually happens before my
 

407
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:30,460
attention actually happens before my
hand goes by hey oh yeah it's not here

408
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
hand goes by hey oh yeah it's not here
 

409
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,439
hand goes by hey oh yeah it's not here
and then he's still a balance no this

410
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:35,449
and then he's still a balance no this
 

411
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:43,059
and then he's still a balance no this
power is here then the throw has the X

412
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:43,069
power is here then the throw has the X
 

413
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:57,929
power is here then the throw has the X
pattern

414
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:57,939

 

415
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:15,670

okay try it again

416
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:15,680

going to be connected to him you feel
 

421
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,090
going to be connected to him you feel
that right there now his interview pass

422
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,100
that right there now his interview pass
 

423
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,750
that right there now his interview pass
to me and now he's with me okay if I

that jumps up and down do you get it so
 

449
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,360
that jumps up and down do you get it so
you have a constant pressure and we're

450
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,370
you have a constant pressure and we're
 

451
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,380
you have a constant pressure and we're
going to work the right front handlers

452
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,390
going to work the right front handlers
 

453
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,990

and I go like that so for example here I
 

547
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,950
and I go like that so for example here I
am at this one which I might be right
