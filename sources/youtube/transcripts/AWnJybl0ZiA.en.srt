1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,550

okay there's there's always lots of

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
okay there's there's always lots of
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,550
okay there's there's always lots of
complications

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
complications
 

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,549
complications
uh because we think too much but

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
uh because we think too much but
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,030
uh because we think too much but
we've got the hassan

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
we've got the hassan
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,110
we've got the hassan
we're going forward

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
we're going forward
 

11
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,589
we're going forward
you don't have to work out what one's

12
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
you don't have to work out what one's
 

13
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,510
you don't have to work out what one's
got the most weight on it

14
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
got the most weight on it
 

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,750
got the most weight on it
right because it's it's pretty obvious

16
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
right because it's it's pretty obvious
 

17
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,750
right because it's it's pretty obvious
if you're square then you've never

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
if you're square then you've never
 

19
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,990
if you're square then you've never
really meant to hit them you're more

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
really meant to hit them you're more
 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,310
really meant to hit them you're more
interested in your own how do i look you

22
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
interested in your own how do i look you
 

23
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,109
interested in your own how do i look you
know

24
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
know
 

25
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,790
know
right so so forward now this one is

26
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
right so so forward now this one is
 

27
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,910
right so so forward now this one is
lighter than this one with weight so you

28
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
lighter than this one with weight so you
 

29
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,670
lighter than this one with weight so you
can turn that one easy so you

30
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
can turn that one easy so you
 

31
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,670
can turn that one easy so you
look it's easy

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
look it's easy
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,750
look it's easy
but if i was to put them together in a

34
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
but if i was to put them together in a
 

35
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:56,630
but if i was to put them together in a
flowing motion

36
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640

 

37
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,510

i'm working on natural ability

38
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
i'm working on natural ability
 

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,869
i'm working on natural ability
this is shifting forward

40
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
this is shifting forward
 

41
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,429
this is shifting forward
this releases the strike

42
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
this releases the strike
 

43
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,230
this releases the strike
that releases that

44
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
that releases that
 

45
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,789
that releases that
that releases that now the next problem

46
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
that releases that now the next problem
 

47
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,590
that releases that now the next problem
i see is you're you're here so now

48
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
i see is you're you're here so now
 

49
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,630
i see is you're you're here so now
you've got

50
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
you've got
 

51
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,109
you've got
a 50-50 or you want to tip it with that

52
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
a 50-50 or you want to tip it with that
 

53
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,710
a 50-50 or you want to tip it with that
leg and then you

54
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720

 

55
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,590

and then you have to push off it again

56
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
and then you have to push off it again
 

57
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,630
and then you have to push off it again
where if it's a natural flow

58
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640

 

59
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:40,230

that's there that's there that's

60
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240

 

61
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,749

and then you've got that repeating again

62
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
and then you've got that repeating again
 

63
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,710
and then you've got that repeating again
you see

64
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720

 

65
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,630

so you start thinking

66
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
so you start thinking
 

67
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,550
so you start thinking
oh that's the same as that

68
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
oh that's the same as that
 

69
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,590
oh that's the same as that
and

70
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
and
 

71
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:08,389
and
you get less and less

72
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399

 

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,869

so then it becomes

74
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
so then it becomes
 

75
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,070
so then it becomes
yeah

76
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
yeah
 

77
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,350
yeah
here

78
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360

 

79
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,150

so i'm making the front foot become the

80
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
so i'm making the front foot become the
 

81
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:32,150
so i'm making the front foot become the
back one

82
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160

 

83
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,550

and then step forward and then go back

84
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
and then step forward and then go back
 

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,670
and then step forward and then go back
i'm doing the backwards and going

86
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
i'm doing the backwards and going
 

87
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,110
i'm doing the backwards and going
forwards now if i leave that it's got a

88
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
forwards now if i leave that it's got a
 

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,630
forwards now if i leave that it's got a
twist at the end

90
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
twist at the end
 

91
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,509
twist at the end
i don't care who says it i had um

92
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
i don't care who says it i had um
 

93
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,550
i don't care who says it i had um
i had one of my

94
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
i had one of my
 

95
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,229
i had one of my
teachers query on my foot opening i said

96
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
teachers query on my foot opening i said
 

97
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,630
teachers query on my foot opening i said
i i got bad knees

98
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
i i got bad knees
 

99
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,550
i i got bad knees
and i found over the years by leaving

100
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
and i found over the years by leaving
 

101
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,990
and i found over the years by leaving
that foot there

102
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
that foot there
 

103
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,390
that foot there
it always twists at the end but this is

104
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
it always twists at the end but this is
 

105
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,710
it always twists at the end but this is
an actual thing of the body you know

106
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
an actual thing of the body you know
 

107
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,190
an actual thing of the body you know
and i think oh i've just done it then

108
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
and i think oh i've just done it then
 

109
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,869
and i think oh i've just done it then
so why would i

110
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
so why would i
 

111
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,229
so why would i
why would i

112
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
why would i
 

113
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,390
why would i
destroy my body

114
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400

 

115
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,750

so yeah

116
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760

 

117
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,710

the front

118
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
the front
 

119
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,670
the front
the front foot becomes the back foot

120
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680

 

121
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,869

okay

122
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
okay
 

123
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,390
okay
so you're going to do the whole thing

124
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
so you're going to do the whole thing
 

125
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,589
so you're going to do the whole thing
now

126
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
now
 

127
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,070
now
and you're going to try to find these

128
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
and you're going to try to find these
 

129
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,470
and you're going to try to find these
pieces you're looking for the pieces

130
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
pieces you're looking for the pieces
 

131
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,920
pieces you're looking for the pieces
rather than the perfect character
