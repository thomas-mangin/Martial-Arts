00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:53,400
through the pattern got it so that your
 

1643
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,510

Consciousness okay but we're going to

1850
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
Consciousness okay but we're going to
 

1851
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,829
Consciousness okay but we're going to
manipulate them even more we're going to

1852
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:18,839
manipulate them even more we're going to
 

1853
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:22,349
manipulate them even more we're going to
manipulate them so that they spiry will

1854
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:22,359
manipulate them so that they spiry will
 

1855
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:25,789
manipulate them so that they spiry will
rotate and the way you do that is with

1856
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:25,799
rotate and the way you do that is with
 

1857
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,549
rotate and the way you do that is with
your hands so it's very important that

1858
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:29,559
your hands so it's very important that
 

1859
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:34,670
your hands so it's very important that
you don't try to make your hands with an

1860
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:34,680
you don't try to make your hands with an
 

1861
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,270
you don't try to make your hands with an
activation of that ego tripartite line

1862
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:38,280
activation of that ego tripartite line
 

1863
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,030
activation of that ego tripartite line
but I have to keep the powder because

1864
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
but I have to keep the powder because
 

1865
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,349
but I have to keep the powder because
the pattern is going to spiral

1866
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:44,359
the pattern is going to spiral
 

1867
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:46,789
the pattern is going to spiral
rotate the alchemical aspects the

1868
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:46,799
rotate the alchemical aspects the
 

1869
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:49,030
rotate the alchemical aspects the
energetic aspects in that lower tonden

1870
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
energetic aspects in that lower tonden
 

1871
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,030
energetic aspects in that lower tonden
field got do you got that okay so I have

1872
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,040
field got do you got that okay so I have
 

1873
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,470
field got do you got that okay so I have
to make these shapes these shap these

1874
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:55,480
to make these shapes these shap these
 

1875
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,789
to make these shapes these shap these
spiral circular shapes I have to make

1876
00:52:57,789 --> 00:52:57,799
spiral circular shapes I have to make
 

1877
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:01,069
spiral circular shapes I have to make
those shapes okay I can't be going in

1878
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:01,079
those shapes okay I can't be going in
 

1879
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,030
those shapes okay I can't be going in
and out those will not affect it okay so

1880
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,040
and out those will not affect it okay so
 

1881
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,470
and out those will not affect it okay so
if you watch my our patterns our

1882
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:09,480
if you watch my our patterns our
 

1883
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,789
if you watch my our patterns our
patterns are rotating you see they're

1884
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:11,799
patterns are rotating you see they're
 

1885
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:14,829
patterns are rotating you see they're
rotating we rotate again if you were

1886
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:14,839
rotating we rotate again if you were
 

1887
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:18,150
rotating we rotate again if you were
looking at us over from ahead you get it

1888
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
looking at us over from ahead you get it
 

1889
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,870
looking at us over from ahead you get it
if you had a camera up there you would

1890
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
if you had a camera up there you would
 

1891
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:27,069
if you had a camera up there you would
see this whole thing is rotating

1892
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:27,079
see this whole thing is rotating
 

1893
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,990
see this whole thing is rotating
you see it okay it's

1894
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,000
you see it okay it's
 

1895
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,870
you see it okay it's
important and if you wash my hands my

1896
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
important and if you wash my hands my
 

1897
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,470
important and if you wash my hands my
hands I won't move my body but my hands

1898
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:35,480
hands I won't move my body but my hands
 

1899
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,030
hands I won't move my body but my hands
are rotating you see do you get it

1900
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:40,040
are rotating you see do you get it
 

1901
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,470
are rotating you see do you get it
okay so there's no reverse and there's

1902
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:43,480
okay so there's no reverse and there's
 

1903
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,990
okay so there's no reverse and there's
no sharp

1904
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,000
no sharp
 

1905
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,670
no sharp
Corners okay you got it and I don't

1906
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:48,680
Corners okay you got it and I don't
 

1907
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,990
Corners okay you got it and I don't
breathe I just open and the body's going

1908
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
breathe I just open and the body's going
 

1909
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,069
breathe I just open and the body's going
to

1910
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:53,079
to
 

1911
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,630
to
breathe got got it I don't breathe just

1912
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
breathe got got it I don't breathe just
 

1913
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,430
breathe got got it I don't breathe just
like I didn't Breathe Here I will have

1914
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
like I didn't Breathe Here I will have
 

1915
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,510
like I didn't Breathe Here I will have
more

1916
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:00,520
more
 

1917
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,910
more
fill and more exhalation because the

1918
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
fill and more exhalation because the
 

1919
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,710
fill and more exhalation because the
movement's bigger do do you understand

1920
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
movement's bigger do do you understand
 

1921
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,150
movement's bigger do do you understand
okay but I don't breathe so watch for

1922
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
okay but I don't breathe so watch for
 

1923
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,430
okay but I don't breathe so watch for
that those

1924
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:13,440

 

1925
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,750

circles but every time if you can make

1926
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:17,760
circles but every time if you can make
 

1927
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,710
circles but every time if you can make
this like a ball in your mind but it's

1928
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
this like a ball in your mind but it's
 

1929
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,670
this like a ball in your mind but it's
out

1930
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
out
 

1931
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,870
out
here you see that I'm kind of spinning

1932
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
here you see that I'm kind of spinning
 

1933
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,630
here you see that I'm kind of spinning
the

1934
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:25,640
the
 

1935
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,990
the
ball do you see I spin the ball here's

1936
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
ball do you see I spin the ball here's
 

1937
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,710
ball do you see I spin the ball here's
the ball I'm on the back side I go under

1938
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:32,720
the ball I'm on the back side I go under
 

1939
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,630
the ball I'm on the back side I go under
I go to the top okay that's that inward

1940
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:35,640
I go to the top okay that's that inward
 

1941
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,950
I go to the top okay that's that inward
that's this part top of the ball the

1942
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:37,960
that's this part top of the ball the
 

1943
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,109
that's this part top of the ball the
ball's here top of the ball unders side

1944
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
ball's here top of the ball unders side
 

1945
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,030
ball's here top of the ball unders side
the ball back on the top on the inside

1946
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,040
the ball back on the top on the inside
 

1947
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,190
the ball back on the top on the inside
of the arm you see that

1948
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:46,200
of the arm you see that
 

1949
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,150
of the arm you see that
okay boom

1950
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,160
okay boom
 

1951
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,470
okay boom
boom here it is the ball take the whole

1952
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
boom here it is the ball take the whole
 

1953
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,270
boom here it is the ball take the whole
ball move it I'm going over the top top

1954
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
ball move it I'm going over the top top
 

1955
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,349
ball move it I'm going over the top top
of the ball boom down and in and that is

1956
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
of the ball boom down and in and that is
 

1957
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,750
of the ball boom down and in and that is
where everything settles like drill

1958
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
where everything settles like drill
 

1959
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,630
where everything settles like drill
one that's why I call iido pins K you

1960
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:07,640
one that's why I call iido pins K you
 

1961
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:21,430
one that's why I call iido pins K you
okay so I'm spinning this whole

1962
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440

 

1963
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,750

thing and if if he if he wasn't there

1964
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:24,760
thing and if if he if he wasn't there
 

1965
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,710
thing and if if he if he wasn't there
you would see me to be spinning this

1966
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
you would see me to be spinning this
 

1967
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,589
you would see me to be spinning this
whole ball whole

1968
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:32,599

 

1969
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:35,549

ball got it you see that imagine there's

1970
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:35,559
ball got it you see that imagine there's
 

1971
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:36,750
ball got it you see that imagine there's
a ball

1972
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:36,760
a ball
 

1973
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,390
a ball
here you have to do the other side cuz

1974
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:39,400
here you have to do the other side cuz
 

1975
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,750
here you have to do the other side cuz
you always spun it one way you have to

1976
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760
you always spun it one way you have to
 

1977
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:53,990
you always spun it one way you have to
do the other

1978
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000

 

1979
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:04,870

side

1980
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880

 

1981
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,510

come make it

1982
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520

 

1983
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:19,190

small

1984

1985
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,789

big doesn't

1986

do

1990
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599

 

1991
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,029

this I can do it on the inside I can do

1992
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:32,039
this I can do it on the inside I can do
 

1993
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,390
this I can do it on the inside I can do
it on the outside can do it on the

1994
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,400
it on the outside can do it on the
 

1995
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,870
it on the outside can do it on the
reverse I can do it on the inverse those

1996
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:35,880
reverse I can do it on the inverse those
 

1997
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,309
reverse I can do it on the inverse those
are all your test

out is your dichotomy is like a force
this way and a force this way do you get

you're doing what R eliada noticed in

00:58:58,829 --> 00:58:58,839
you're doing what R eliada noticed in
 

2089

you're doing what R eliada noticed in
all these cultures this is a ritual of

which I totally agree with is you are
 

2095
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:12,349
which I totally agree with is you are
undoing

rituals okay so as we spiral rotate the

2110
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:39,240
rituals okay so as we spiral rotate the
 

2111
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,630
rituals okay so as we spiral rotate the
energetic alchemical aspects of our

2112
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:41,640
energetic alchemical aspects of our
 

2113
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,870
energetic alchemical aspects of our
being our ego tripartite mind starts to

2114
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:44,880
being our ego tripartite mind starts to
 

2115
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,870
being our ego tripartite mind starts to
spiry or rotate and as it starts to

2116
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:46,880
spiry or rotate and as it starts to
 

2117
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,910
spiry or rotate and as it starts to
spiral rotate it actually finds a

2118
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:50,920
spiral rotate it actually finds a
 

2119
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,029
spiral rotate it actually finds a
Stillness because it can't find a

2120
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:53,039
Stillness because it can't find a
 

2121
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,910
Stillness because it can't find a
dichotomy anymore do you see and now

2122
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
dichotomy anymore do you see and now
 

2123
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,789
dichotomy anymore do you see and now
it's

2124
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:56,799
it's
 

2125
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,309
it's
centered now God mind comes in this God

2126
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319

Consciousness or the experience of the
 

2131
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,069
Consciousness or the experience of the
world outside of dichotomy that is what

2132
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:07,079
world outside of dichotomy that is what
 

2133
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:10,029
world outside of dichotomy that is what
we're doing so as I spiral rotate all

2134
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:10,039
we're doing so as I spiral rotate all
 

2135
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,309
we're doing so as I spiral rotate all
this stuff my dichotomous mind my ego

tripartite mind is going where are we

2138
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
tripartite mind is going where are we
 

2139
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,349
tripartite mind is going where are we
going what are we doing if you pay

2140
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:17,359
going what are we doing if you pay
 

2141
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,710
going what are we doing if you pay
attention how many times have you got

2142
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
attention how many times have you got
 

2143
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,349
attention how many times have you got
lost on when we're doing a lot of

lost on when we're doing a lot of
 

2145
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:22,990
lost on when we're doing a lot of
spirals and a lot of circles can't stay

up you see it wants to put it everything

2148
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
up you see it wants to put it everything
 

2149
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,230

2151
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,870

that experience of the world that mind
that's what we want to bring us stop to

2253
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:00,670

self-defense I say there're these

2254
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:00,680

01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119

 

2259
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,069

okay while they're not

2260
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
okay while they're not
 

2261
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,150
okay while they're not
self-defense because it is a yinong

2262
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:15,160
self-defense because it is a yinong
 

2263
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:20,150
self-defense because it is a yinong
