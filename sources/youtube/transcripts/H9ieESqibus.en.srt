00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400

 

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,830

We went over

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:12,840
We went over
 

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,550
We went over
um the the rationale behind the tactical

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,560
um the the rationale behind the tactical
 

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,950
um the the rationale behind the tactical
architecture. Again, just in short, but

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
architecture. Again, just in short, but
 

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,109
architecture. Again, just in short, but
it's been said in the last video I

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
it's been said in the last video I
 

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,630
it's been said in the last video I
posted and it's been written out in a

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:25,640
posted and it's been written out in a
 

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,230
posted and it's been written out in a
reply in the uh text site. Okay. But in

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
reply in the uh text site. Okay. But in
 

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,750
reply in the uh text site. Okay. But in
short,

16
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
short,
 

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,470
short,
uh, for whatever reason, I ended up in

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
uh, for whatever reason, I ended up in
 

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,630
uh, for whatever reason, I ended up in
mid-range

20
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640
mid-range
 

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,229
mid-range
grappling. So, all my other previous

22
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
grappling. So, all my other previous
 

23
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,549
grappling. So, all my other previous
tactical spectrums were

24
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:41,559
tactical spectrums were
 

25
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,990
tactical spectrums were
nonfunctional. In mid-range grappling,

26
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
nonfunctional. In mid-range grappling,
 

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,430
nonfunctional. In mid-range grappling,
you would attempt to do the throw

28
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,440
you would attempt to do the throw
 

29
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,389
you would attempt to do the throw
first. He ends up countering the throw,

30
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:49,399
first. He ends up countering the throw,
 

31
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,470
first. He ends up countering the throw,
but this is mid-range grappling through

32
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
but this is mid-range grappling through
 

33
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,830
but this is mid-range grappling through
internals. So, his center is being

34
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:54,840
internals. So, his center is being
 

35
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,430
internals. So, his center is being
seized and I am projecting

36
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
seized and I am projecting
 

37
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,590
seized and I am projecting
it. The wrestler, whoever it is who's

38
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
it. The wrestler, whoever it is who's
 

39
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,910
it. The wrestler, whoever it is who's
grappling with me, is going to realize,

40
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
grappling with me, is going to realize,
 

41
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,390
grappling with me, is going to realize,
they're going to feel

42
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
they're going to feel
 

43
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,469
they're going to feel
intuitively that the contact point that

44
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
intuitively that the contact point that
 

45
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,510
intuitively that the contact point that
I'm using is what is generating the

46
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
I'm using is what is generating the
 

47
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,670
I'm using is what is generating the
center seizure/p projection. So, they're

48
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
center seizure/p projection. So, they're
 

49
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,670
center seizure/p projection. So, they're
going to uh try to yin. They're going to

50
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
going to uh try to yin. They're going to
 

51
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,310
going to uh try to yin. They're going to
do a yin yield on that.

52
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
do a yin yield on that.
 

53
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,429
do a yin yield on that.
When they do that yin yield in that

54
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:24,439
When they do that yin yield in that
 

55
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,390
When they do that yin yield in that
moment, that arm is not connected to the

56
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
moment, that arm is not connected to the
 

57
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,310
moment, that arm is not connected to the
core muscle groups, it becomes very

58
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,320
core muscle groups, it becomes very
 

59
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,990
core muscle groups, it becomes very
manipulable. It will get them off that

60
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
manipulable. It will get them off that
 

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,149
manipulable. It will get them off that
center though. That's why they do it.

62
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
center though. That's why they do it.
 

63
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,510
center though. That's why they do it.
If you as a side note here when we do

64
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
If you as a side note here when we do
 

65
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,630
If you as a side note here when we do
the center projection or the koku

66
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
the center projection or the koku
 

67
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,590
the center projection or the koku
cultivation drill set it's very

68
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
cultivation drill set it's very
 

69
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,429
cultivation drill set it's very
important that the uk keep the same

70
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
important that the uk keep the same
 

71
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,550
important that the uk keep the same
energy and the same skeletal structure

72
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
energy and the same skeletal structure
 

73
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,190
energy and the same skeletal structure
so I can do that and as you are trying

74
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
so I can do that and as you are trying
 

75
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,109
so I can do that and as you are trying
to train your uk

76
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
to train your uk
 

77
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,029
to train your uk
or as we here we have lower level uk

78
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
or as we here we have lower level uk
 

79
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,589
or as we here we have lower level uk
just like they're anybody who doesn't

80
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
just like they're anybody who doesn't
 

81
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,550
just like they're anybody who doesn't
have enough hours in, enough reps, and

82
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
have enough hours in, enough reps, and
 

83
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,510
have enough hours in, enough reps, and
so they underperform. Okay? And one of

84
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
so they underperform. Okay? And one of
 

85
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,510
so they underperform. Okay? And one of
the ways that they underperform, the new

86
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
the ways that they underperform, the new
 

87
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,350
the ways that they underperform, the new
UK, the one who doesn't meet the

88
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
UK, the one who doesn't meet the
 

89
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,869
UK, the one who doesn't meet the
training equations yet, is when you try

90
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
training equations yet, is when you try
 

91
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,990
training equations yet, is when you try
the cultivation drill set and they go to

92
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
the cultivation drill set and they go to
 

93
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,830
the cultivation drill set and they go to
push, they do that. Or he goes to push

94
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
push, they do that. Or he goes to push
 

95
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,790
push, they do that. Or he goes to push
me back and they do that. And many of

96
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
me back and they do that. And many of
 

97
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,110
me back and they do that. And many of
you have been corrected. Hey, don't let

98
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
you have been corrected. Hey, don't let
 

99
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,589
you have been corrected. Hey, don't let
your UK do that. because we are using

100
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
your UK do that. because we are using
 

101
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,470
your UK do that. because we are using
their skeletal alignment to give us

102
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
their skeletal alignment to give us
 

103
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,949
their skeletal alignment to give us
enough gross insight into what we're

104
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
enough gross insight into what we're
 

105
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,670
enough gross insight into what we're
doing. Okay? But you saw in them in that

106
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,680
doing. Okay? But you saw in them in that
 

107
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,150
doing. Okay? But you saw in them in that
reaction the same thing that people do

108
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
reaction the same thing that people do
 

109
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,470
reaction the same thing that people do
at the speed of life inside a fight.

110
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
at the speed of life inside a fight.
 

111
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,790
at the speed of life inside a fight.
They're going to try to get rid of that

112
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
They're going to try to get rid of that
 

113
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,790
They're going to try to get rid of that
and regain control of their center of

114
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
and regain control of their center of
 

115
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,110
and regain control of their center of
gravity.

116
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
gravity.
 

117
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,390
gravity.
Okay, that is what is happening in

118
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,400
Okay, that is what is happening in
 

119
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,070
Okay, that is what is happening in
EQ. You seize their center. you're

120
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
EQ. You seize their center. you're
 

121
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,750
EQ. You seize their center. you're
starting to project it. They realize

122
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
starting to project it. They realize
 

123
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,350
starting to project it. They realize
they're going to lose their balance.

124
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
they're going to lose their balance.
 

125
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,190
they're going to lose their balance.
They're going to yiny yield or hyper

126
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
They're going to yiny yield or hyper
 

127
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,430
They're going to yiny yield or hyper
yiny yield on the arm. The arm is now

128
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
yiny yield on the arm. The arm is now
 

129
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,070
yiny yield on the arm. The arm is now
isolated from the core muscle groups. It

130
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
isolated from the core muscle groups. It
 

131
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,869
isolated from the core muscle groups. It
becomes manipulable and we do an arm

132
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
becomes manipulable and we do an arm
 

133
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,869
becomes manipulable and we do an arm
isolation technique. In this case, the

134
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
isolation technique. In this case, the
 

135
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,750
isolation technique. In this case, the
arm bar.

136
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
arm bar.
 

137
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,270
arm bar.
Okay, we went over that. We also noted

138
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
Okay, we went over that. We also noted
 

139
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,990
Okay, we went over that. We also noted
that uh we just don't have the

140
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
that uh we just don't have the
 

141
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,630
that uh we just don't have the
projection

142
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,640
projection
 

143
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,350
projection
skills either.

144
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
skills either.
 

145
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,589
skills either.
We we we can't generate the start of

146
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
We we we can't generate the start of
 

147
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,229
We we we can't generate the start of
that sequence because we cannot seize

148
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
that sequence because we cannot seize
 

149
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,750
that sequence because we cannot seize
the center andor we cannot project their

150
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
the center andor we cannot project their
 

151
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,309
the center andor we cannot project their
center such that it's their line of

152
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
center such that it's their line of
 

153
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,750
center such that it's their line of
gravity is going to fall outside their

154
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
gravity is going to fall outside their
 

155
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,750
gravity is going to fall outside their
base of support and so we cannot really

156
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
base of support and so we cannot really
 

157
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,309
base of support and so we cannot really
generate that arm isolation movement.

158
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
generate that arm isolation movement.
 

159
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,190
generate that arm isolation movement.
Okay. What that looks like is don't

160
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
Okay. What that looks like is don't
 

161
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,869
Okay. What that looks like is don't
don't project me just kind of do it

162
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
don't project me just kind of do it
 

163
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,670
don't project me just kind of do it
externally here is your uk is very

164
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
externally here is your uk is very
 

165
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,070
externally here is your uk is very
strong. the the the core is still able

166
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
strong. the the the core is still able
 

167
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,350
strong. the the the core is still able
to do what it needs to do here and even

168
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
to do what it needs to do here and even
 

169
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,309
to do what it needs to do here and even
push down. Your your federite uka

170
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
push down. Your your federite uka
 

171
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,949
push down. Your your federite uka
doesn't do that. They kind of are just

172
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
doesn't do that. They kind of are just
 

173
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,990
doesn't do that. They kind of are just
here and then they fall down. But your

174
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
here and then they fall down. But your
 

175
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,509
here and then they fall down. But your
your um ukas who are not trained in the

176
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
your um ukas who are not trained in the
 

177
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,629
your um ukas who are not trained in the
culture, they're able to wonder what

178
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
culture, they're able to wonder what
 

179
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,629
culture, they're able to wonder what
you're trying to do because they're

180
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
you're trying to do because they're
 

181
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,590
you're trying to do because they're
really strong here.

182
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:26,600
really strong here.
 

183
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,189
really strong here.
Okay. If you now try to push on them,

184
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
Okay. If you now try to push on them,
 

185
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,350
Okay. If you now try to push on them,
you that's where you get that walk.

186
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
you that's where you get that walk.
 

187
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,230
you that's where you get that walk.
Okay? For

188
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240

 

189
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,230

example, we have to get that that

190
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
example, we have to get that that
 

191
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,870
example, we have to get that that
seizure and that projection. To do that,

192
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
seizure and that projection. To do that,
 

193
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,189
seizure and that projection. To do that,
we need internal skills. You just have

194
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
we need internal skills. You just have
 

195
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,430
we need internal skills. You just have
to go back to the co cultivation drill

196
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
to go back to the co cultivation drill
 

197
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,230
to go back to the co cultivation drill
set. You have to put in time. You have

198
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
set. You have to put in time. You have
 

199
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,629
set. You have to put in time. You have
to come here or you have to do the video

200
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
to come here or you have to do the video
 

201
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,950
to come here or you have to do the video
exchange. It takes years. There's no one

202
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
exchange. It takes years. There's no one
 

203
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,230
exchange. It takes years. There's no one
here who got it like it's some technique

204
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
here who got it like it's some technique
 

205
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,270
here who got it like it's some technique
to get. It's a skill to get. Skills take

206
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
to get. It's a skill to get. Skills take
 

207
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,950
to get. It's a skill to get. Skills take
years to develop. And uh you can see

208
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
years to develop. And uh you can see
 

209
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,310
years to develop. And uh you can see
here in our dashes here, while they are

210
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
here in our dashes here, while they are
 

211
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,110
here in our dashes here, while they are
ahead of where you all are at, they're

212
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
ahead of where you all are at, they're
 

213
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,749
ahead of where you all are at, they're
not all at the same level because they

214
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
not all at the same level because they
 

215
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,990
not all at the same level because they
have different levels of commitment and

216
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
have different levels of commitment and
 

217
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,510
have different levels of commitment and
they haven't all met the training

218
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
they haven't all met the training
 

219
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,029
they haven't all met the training
equations. But none of them uh have less

220
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
equations. But none of them uh have less
 

221
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,590
equations. But none of them uh have less
than one year trying to work on this

222
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
than one year trying to work on this
 

223
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,110
than one year trying to work on this
stuff. Okay? Many of them uh lots of

224
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
stuff. Okay? Many of them uh lots of
 

225
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,430
stuff. Okay? Many of them uh lots of
years working on it. And the ones who

226
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
years working on it. And the ones who
 

227
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,670
years working on it. And the ones who
are more skilled at it, they have more

228
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
are more skilled at it, they have more
 

229
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,909
are more skilled at it, they have more
actual training hours at it than ours

230
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
actual training hours at it than ours
 

231
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,590
actual training hours at it than ours
that are not as skilled at it.

232
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:38,600
that are not as skilled at it.
 

233
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,350
that are not as skilled at it.
Okay? So, you need to put your time in.

234
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
Okay? So, you need to put your time in.
 

235
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
Okay? So, you need to put your time in.
You need to be patient. Get in that

236
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
You need to be patient. Get in that
 

237
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,150
You need to be patient. Get in that
video exchange. Uh, and as I've shared

238
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,160
video exchange. Uh, and as I've shared
 

239
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,749
video exchange. Uh, and as I've shared
recently, Ivan is just proof it can be

240
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
recently, Ivan is just proof it can be
 

241
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,790
recently, Ivan is just proof it can be
done. I've never met him. We He's never

242
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
done. I've never met him. We He's never
 

243
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,510
done. I've never met him. We He's never
felt my technique, but he keeps he

244
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
felt my technique, but he keeps he
 

245
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,070
felt my technique, but he keeps he
exchanges the most videos with me out of

246
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
exchanges the most videos with me out of
 

247
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,430
exchanges the most videos with me out of
anybody in the group. So, just like the

248
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
anybody in the group. So, just like the
 

249
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,909
anybody in the group. So, just like the
Dashi here that can do it, they have the

250
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
Dashi here that can do it, they have the
 

251
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,230
Dashi here that can do it, they have the
most training hours out of the others

252
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
most training hours out of the others
 

253
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,110
most training hours out of the others
who cannot. Ivan has the most video

254
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
who cannot. Ivan has the most video
 

255
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,350
who cannot. Ivan has the most video
exchange hours out of anyone else in the

256
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
exchange hours out of anyone else in the
 

257
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,670
exchange hours out of anyone else in the
group. he can do it more than other

258
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
group. he can do it more than other
 

259
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,790
group. he can do it more than other
people can do it.

260
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:17,800
people can do it.
 

261
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,070
people can do it.
Okay. Uh the next thing that we have to

262
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay. Uh the next thing that we have to
 

263
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,590
Okay. Uh the next thing that we have to
deal with is how not to push UK

264
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:26,600
deal with is how not to push UK
 

265
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,110
deal with is how not to push UK
away. And then the last thing to deal

266
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
away. And then the last thing to deal
 

267
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,670
away. And then the last thing to deal
with is how to do the X path.

268
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:32,680
with is how to do the X path.
 

269
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,469
with is how to do the X path.
Okay. So going in review again, we know

270
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
Okay. So going in review again, we know
 

271
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,510
Okay. So going in review again, we know
the rationale behind the tactical

272
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
the rationale behind the tactical
 

273
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,270
the rationale behind the tactical
architecture. I can't really generate it

274
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
architecture. I can't really generate it
 

275
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,749
architecture. I can't really generate it
until we address the second thing. I

276
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
until we address the second thing. I
 

277
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,070
until we address the second thing. I
need the internal skills. What do I have

278
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
need the internal skills. What do I have
 

279
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,350
need the internal skills. What do I have
to do? Not try to fix Eekio. Do the CoQ

280
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
to do? Not try to fix Eekio. Do the CoQ
 

281
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,990
to do? Not try to fix Eekio. Do the CoQ
cultivation drill set. This third thing

282
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
cultivation drill set. This third thing
 

283
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,390
cultivation drill set. This third thing
of not pushing UK away is we can fix

284
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
of not pushing UK away is we can fix
 

285
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,550
of not pushing UK away is we can fix
that. And if we fix this, we can kind of

286
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
that. And if we fix this, we can kind of
 

287
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,550
that. And if we fix this, we can kind of
game

288
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
game
 

289
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,029
game
ourselves to be able to also get the X

290
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
ourselves to be able to also get the X
 

291
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,670
ourselves to be able to also get the X
pattern. Okay? And that's what we're

292
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
pattern. Okay? And that's what we're
 

293
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,270
pattern. Okay? And that's what we're
going to do today. We're going to leave

294
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
going to do today. We're going to leave
 

295
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,830
going to do today. We're going to leave
the other two stuff off the table and

296
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
the other two stuff off the table and
 

297
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,749
the other two stuff off the table and
we're going to look at how do I not push

298
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
we're going to look at how do I not push
 

299
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,909
we're going to look at how do I not push
UK away. And by not pushing UK away, how

300
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
UK away. And by not pushing UK away, how
 

301
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,150
UK away. And by not pushing UK away, how
do I actually enter? Because I cannot

302
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
do I actually enter? Because I cannot
 

303
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,430
do I actually enter? Because I cannot
enter on someone who is perpetually

304
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
enter on someone who is perpetually
 

305
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,589
enter on someone who is perpetually
being pushed ahead of me because it's

306
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
being pushed ahead of me because it's
 

307
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,909
being pushed ahead of me because it's
impossible. Okay. All right.

308
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
impossible. Okay. All right.
 

309
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,990
impossible. Okay. All right.
So, the main thing is first let's set up

310
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
So, the main thing is first let's set up
 

311
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,670
So, the main thing is first let's set up
what we're looking at. We get to here.

312
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
what we're looking at. We get to here.
 

313
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,350
what we're looking at. We get to here.
Okay. You got to here. Um, and let's

314
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
Okay. You got to here. Um, and let's
 

315
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,189
Okay. You got to here. Um, and let's
mark his elbow in the vertical

316
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:42,199
mark his elbow in the vertical
 

317
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,270
mark his elbow in the vertical
plane. Okay. And we're going that

318
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,280
plane. Okay. And we're going that
 

319
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,749
plane. Okay. And we're going that
way. The push that I'm talking about is

320
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
way. The push that I'm talking about is
 

321
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,189
way. The push that I'm talking about is
I take his elbow and I continue to move

322
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
I take his elbow and I continue to move
 

323
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,670
I take his elbow and I continue to move
it in the direction that we're traveling

324
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
it in the direction that we're traveling
 

325
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,469
it in the direction that we're traveling
past where it

326
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:57,479
past where it
 

327
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,350
past where it
was. We'll do that one more time. Put it

328
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
was. We'll do that one more time. Put it
 

329
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,070
was. We'll do that one more time. Put it
right where it is. Cool. And now I push

330
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
right where it is. Cool. And now I push
 

331
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,029
right where it is. Cool. And now I push
it forward off that vertical plane

332
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
it forward off that vertical plane
 

333
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,990
it forward off that vertical plane
forward like that. That's the problem. I

334
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
forward like that. That's the problem. I
 

335
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,150
forward like that. That's the problem. I
can't enter on that because I am

336
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
can't enter on that because I am
 

337
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,309
can't enter on that because I am
perpetually moving them ahead of me.

338
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
perpetually moving them ahead of me.
 

339
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,869
perpetually moving them ahead of me.
Okay? And if I can't enter, then I can't

340
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
Okay? And if I can't enter, then I can't
 

341
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,430
Okay? And if I can't enter, then I can't
do the action

342
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:20,440
do the action
 

343
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,150
do the action
pattern. There's two places

344
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
pattern. There's two places
 

345
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,070
pattern. There's two places
uh well there's three places that allow

346
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
uh well there's three places that allow
 

347
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,230
uh well there's three places that allow
me to enter without pushing him forward.

348
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
me to enter without pushing him forward.
 

349
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,110
me to enter without pushing him forward.
The first one is related to the Koku

350
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
The first one is related to the Koku
 

351
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,110
The first one is related to the Koku
projection and his counter to the throw

352
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
projection and his counter to the throw
 

353
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,509
projection and his counter to the throw
in the hyper yin yield.

354
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:40,519
in the hyper yin yield.
 

355
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,230
in the hyper yin yield.
Okay. Um if he if he keeps his arm

356
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
Okay. Um if he if he keeps his arm
 

357
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,710
Okay. Um if he if he keeps his arm
straight then where I'm touching will

358
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
straight then where I'm touching will
 

359
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,750
straight then where I'm touching will
get his

360
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
get his
 

361
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,230
get his
center. So he hyperunials just like the

362
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
center. So he hyperunials just like the
 

363
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,949
center. So he hyperunials just like the
the bad training partner in the

364
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
the bad training partner in the
 

365
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,070
the bad training partner in the
cultivation drill set. Okay. But of

366
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
cultivation drill set. Okay. But of
 

367
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,190
cultivation drill set. Okay. But of
course that means that as I travel with

368
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
course that means that as I travel with
 

369
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,190
course that means that as I travel with
his elbow, he didn't go forward. Okay,

370
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
his elbow, he didn't go forward. Okay,
 

371
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,590
his elbow, he didn't go forward. Okay,
it's

372
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:06,600
it's
 

373
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,829
it's
yin. And this is very important because

374
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
yin. And this is very important because
 

375
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,430
yin. And this is very important because
this is now the harmonization of yin and

376
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
this is now the harmonization of yin and
 

377
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,430
this is now the harmonization of yin and
yang. He has yin. I can enter. When I

378
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
yang. He has yin. I can enter. When I
 

379
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,430
yang. He has yin. I can enter. When I
push the

380
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,440
push the
 

381
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,910
push the
elbow, his

382
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:20,920
elbow, his
 

383
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,910
elbow, his
inertia and his mass, his inertia

384
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
inertia and his mass, his inertia
 

385
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,670
inertia and his mass, his inertia
keeping him still is yong aspect. And so

386
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
keeping him still is yong aspect. And so
 

387
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,750
keeping him still is yong aspect. And so
this is technically a yongyong clash

388
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
this is technically a yongyong clash
 

389
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,150
this is technically a yongyong clash
when I push that ahead.

390
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
when I push that ahead.
 

391
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,590
when I push that ahead.
This is why, for example, you can do it

392
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
This is why, for example, you can do it
 

393
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,550
This is why, for example, you can do it
on smaller

394
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:37,560
on smaller
 

395
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,110
on smaller
uk or people you outrank because they'll

396
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
uk or people you outrank because they'll
 

397
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,910
uk or people you outrank because they'll
never go against you. Okay? and why you

398
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
never go against you. Okay? and why you
 

399
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,310
never go against you. Okay? and why you
can't on people that outrank you or

400
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,320
can't on people that outrank you or
 

401
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,870
can't on people that outrank you or
especially big heavy uk who outrank you,

402
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
especially big heavy uk who outrank you,
 

403
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,750
especially big heavy uk who outrank you,
right? Or big heavy uk who don't know

404
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
right? Or big heavy uk who don't know
 

405
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,269
right? Or big heavy uk who don't know
the choreography that they're supposed

406
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
the choreography that they're supposed
 

407
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,750
the choreography that they're supposed
to lay down. You you're feeling the yong

408
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
to lay down. You you're feeling the yong
 

409
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,550
to lay down. You you're feeling the yong
yong conflict. Okay? When you're trying

410
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
yong conflict. Okay? When you're trying
 

411
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,710
yong conflict. Okay? When you're trying
to rest someone or fight someone,

412
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
to rest someone or fight someone,
 

413
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,550
to rest someone or fight someone,
they're just going to resist it. You're

414
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
they're just going to resist it. You're
 

415
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,670
they're just going to resist it. You're
not going to be able to do it.

416
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:06,680
not going to be able to do it.
 

417
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,910
not going to be able to do it.
Okay? All right. So there is that first

418
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
Okay? All right. So there is that first
 

419
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,269
Okay? All right. So there is that first
yin yield when he hyper yin yields there

420
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
yin yield when he hyper yin yields there
 

421
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,949
yin yield when he hyper yin yields there
in response to the projection on his

422
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:15,959
in response to the projection on his
 

423
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,150
in response to the projection on his
center. We're not really going to play

424
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
center. We're not really going to play
 

425
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,790
center. We're not really going to play
with that

426
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
with that
 

427
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,829
with that
today. We're going to play with the

428
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
today. We're going to play with the
 

429
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,389
today. We're going to play with the
other two yin yields that I do. So when

430
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
other two yin yields that I do. So when
 

431
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,430
other two yin yields that I do. So when
I'm going to have him kind of push on

432
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm going to have him kind of push on
 

433
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,509
I'm going to have him kind of push on
me. Okay. I don't go from the inward

434
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:32,519
me. Okay. I don't go from the inward
 

435
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,990
me. Okay. I don't go from the inward
spiral up to the elbow as many of you

436
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
spiral up to the elbow as many of you
 

437
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,910
spiral up to the elbow as many of you
are doing. So it kind of looks here I

438
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
are doing. So it kind of looks here I
 

439
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,069
are doing. So it kind of looks here I
here's my hand and you're going

440
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079

 

441
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,389

here. This this grip here. I'll do it

442
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
here. This this grip here. I'll do it
 

443
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,110
here. This this grip here. I'll do it
slow. You'll see what's happening. Take

444
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
slow. You'll see what's happening. Take
 

445
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,310
slow. You'll see what's happening. Take
your hand off the mat. Okay. You'll see

446
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
your hand off the mat. Okay. You'll see
 

447
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,870
your hand off the mat. Okay. You'll see
that that elbow is moving forward. So

448
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
that that elbow is moving forward. So
 

449
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,269
that that elbow is moving forward. So
we'll do the plane

450
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:00,279
we'll do the plane
 

451
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,829
we'll do the plane
again. Okay. And me trying to go from

452
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
again. Okay. And me trying to go from
 

453
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,190
again. Okay. And me trying to go from
the grip to the elbow will make his

454
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
the grip to the elbow will make his
 

455
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,790
the grip to the elbow will make his
elbow move forward of the

456
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:09,800
elbow move forward of the
 

457
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,110
elbow move forward of the
plane. Sean, is she on the elbow plane?

458
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
plane. Sean, is she on the elbow plane?
 

459
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,550
plane. Sean, is she on the elbow plane?
I Yes. Yes. Okay. So, we'll do it slow.

460
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
I Yes. Yes. Okay. So, we'll do it slow.
 

461
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,470
I Yes. Yes. Okay. So, we'll do it slow.
I start to shift my weight. I start to

462
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
I start to shift my weight. I start to
 

463
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,150
I start to shift my weight. I start to
reach for the elbow and you start making

464
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
reach for the elbow and you start making
 

465
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,750
reach for the elbow and you start making
it go forward. At the speed of life, it

466
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
it go forward. At the speed of life, it
 

467
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,750
it go forward. At the speed of life, it
might only go forward an inch and you

468
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
might only go forward an inch and you
 

469
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,550
might only go forward an inch and you
got on the elbow. But you just made him

470
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
got on the elbow. But you just made him
 

471
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,790
got on the elbow. But you just made him
go forward. You made inertia go forward.

472
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
go forward. You made inertia go forward.
 

473
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,470
go forward. You made inertia go forward.
And it's just the beginning of that

474
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
And it's just the beginning of that
 

475
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,190
And it's just the beginning of that

upon
 

501
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,790
upon
uh how much yang is in his grip. So, if

502
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
uh how much yang is in his grip. So, if
 

503
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,190
uh how much yang is in his grip. So, if
he has a lot of yong in that grip,

504
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
he has a lot of yong in that grip,
 

505
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,750
he has a lot of yong in that grip,
you're going to do a pretty big yin yo.

506
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
you're going to do a pretty big yin yo.
 

507

you're going to do a pretty big yin yo.
If he has, for example, very little yong

508
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
If he has, for example, very little yong
 

509
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,430
If he has, for example, very little yong
because in his projection, he barely has

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,230
because in his projection, he barely has
any fingers on there. Do you see there's

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
any fingers on there. Do you see there's
 

513
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,629
any fingers on there. Do you see there's
barely any fingers? There'll be less

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,480
I have my arm on the other
 

557
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,470
I have my arm on the other
side. Instead I'm here like this with my

558
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
side. Instead I'm here like this with my

through that
 

569
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,750
through that
trap. That trap requires a new wheel

570
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
trap. That trap requires a new wheel
 

571
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,069

yawn he has. The next
 

577
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,790
yawn he has. The next
thing is you have to understand why you

578
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
thing is you have to understand why you
 

579
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,870
thing is you have to understand why you

the D pony

582
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,240
the D pony
 

583
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,990
the D pony
cue. like a a rider in D would do heel

584
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000

588
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
pony, I want you to press. Okay. So,
 

589
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,069
pony, I want you to press. Okay. So,
same thing

00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:23,079
same thing
 

591
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,670
same thing

But you know as one of you found out
firsthand that there's nothing stopping

firsthand that there's nothing stopping
 

607
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,269
firsthand that there's nothing stopping
that UK from stepping with this leg as

608
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
that UK from stepping with this leg as
 

609
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:49,949
that UK from stepping with this leg as
you

610
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:49,959

video and we demonstrated that that
 

615
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,269
video and we demonstrated that that
that's very possible. That's the

616
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
that's very possible. That's the
 

617
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,910
that's very possible. That's the
question no one asked in

618
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
question no one asked in
 

619
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,389
question no one asked in
Fedora. What is stopping the

620
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:01,399
Fedora. What is stopping the

that was just a cue for them to do what

630
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
that was just a cue for them to do what
 

631
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,389
that was just a cue for them to do what
they've been trained to do. And you have

632
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
they've been trained to do. And you have
 

633
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,509
they've been trained to do. And you have
to understand that pinning cannot be

634
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
to understand that pinning cannot be
 

635
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,910
to understand that pinning cannot be
done with me pushing someone away from

636
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
done with me pushing someone away from
 

637
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,670
done with me pushing someone away from
me. Pinning is in and down, not out and

638
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
me. Pinning is in and down, not out and
 

639
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,670
me. Pinning is in and down, not out and
away. Okay? And I can't enter and

640
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
away. Okay? And I can't enter and
 

641
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,910
away. Okay? And I can't enter and
something that is being perpetually

642
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
something that is being perpetually
 

643
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,030
something that is being perpetually
moved ahead of me. So, if we get Mark

644
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
moved ahead of me. So, if we get Mark
 

645
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,990
moved ahead of me. So, if we get Mark
his

646
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,000

 

647
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,470

elbow, okay, you're going to notice that

648
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
elbow, okay, you're going to notice that
 

649
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,629
elbow, okay, you're going to notice that
his elbow does not go forward at that

650
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
his elbow does not go forward at that
 

651
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,509
his elbow does not go forward at that
line, but actually is coming this way on

652
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
line, but actually is coming this way on
 

653
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,030
line, but actually is coming this way on
the

654
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,040

 

655
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,910

line. So, we go here. Boom. There's that

656
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
line. So, we go here. Boom. There's that
 

657
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,310
line. So, we go here. Boom. There's that
little inch that I got there. and then

658
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
little inch that I got there. and then
 

659
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,269
little inch that I got there. and then
his elbows going this way on the

660
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:04,279

 

661
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,590

line. Depending on how much yawn he has,

662
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
line. Depending on how much yawn he has,
 

663
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,829
line. Depending on how much yawn he has,
how much inertia there was in the spinal

664
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
how much inertia there was in the spinal
 

665
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,470
how much inertia there was in the spinal
displacement,

666
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,480
displacement,
 

667
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,749
displacement,
uh you might not have it come this way.

668
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
uh you might not have it come this way.
 

669
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,269
uh you might not have it come this way.
It might just stay right where it's at.

670
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:18,279
It might just stay right where it's at.
 

671
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,670
It might just stay right where it's at.
Okay? But you definitely don't want to

672
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
Okay? But you definitely don't want to
 

673
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,749
Okay? But you definitely don't want to
shove it ahead of you. So, we have some

674
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
shove it ahead of you. So, we have some
 

675
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,749
shove it ahead of you. So, we have some
of your

676
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:26,759
of your
 

677
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,269
of your
submissions

678
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:28,279
submissions
 

679
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,189
submissions
where you're out here like that. Now,

680
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
where you're out here like that. Now,
 

681
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,949
where you're out here like that. Now,
that's not where your power is. Your

682
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
that's not where your power is. Your
 

683
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,069
that's not where your power is. Your
power is over here. We even had some of

684
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
power is over here. We even had some of
 

685
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,990
power is over here. We even had some of
our dashing that had that happen.

686
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,000

 

687
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,189

Okay. This is going around this

688
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:46,199

 

689
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,870

way. So, think about it in regards to

690
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:49,880
way. So, think about it in regards to
 

691
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,509
way. So, think about it in regards to
this. His elbow's out

692
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:52,519
this. His elbow's out
 

693
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,910
this. His elbow's out
there. I yield. My arm is out there. I

694
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
there. I yield. My arm is out there. I
 

695
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,670
there. I yield. My arm is out there. I
am going to

696
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:00,680
am going to
 

697
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,510
am going to
enter. But and you can see that this

698
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,520
enter. But and you can see that this
 

699
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,949
enter. But and you can see that this
elbow plane

700
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:07,959

 

701
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,909

please is still slightly forward of my

702
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
please is still slightly forward of my
 

703
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,630
please is still slightly forward of my
power line which is over

704
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:15,640
power line which is over
 

705
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,789
power line which is over
here. So if I push down on this straight

706
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
here. So if I push down on this straight
 

707
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,590
here. So if I push down on this straight
just go straight down.

708
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
just go straight down.
 

709
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,150
just go straight down.
You can see it's to my left where it

710
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
You can see it's to my left where it
 

711
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,429
You can see it's to my left where it
needed to be over

712
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
needed to be over
 

713
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,909
needed to be over
here. So there always was it's just

714
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
here. So there always was it's just
 

715
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,710
here. So there always was it's just
you're so used to the Federite way that

716
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
you're so used to the Federite way that
 

717
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,190
you're so used to the Federite way that
you move it that way that you you can't

718
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
you move it that way that you you can't
 

719
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,430
you move it that way that you you can't
see that there had to be some way that

720
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
see that there had to be some way that
 

721
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,390
see that there had to be some way that
on the one step he was able to bring the

722
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
on the one step he was able to bring the
 

723
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,590
on the one step he was able to bring the
UK's hand and his hand back underneath

724
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
UK's hand and his hand back underneath
 

725
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,390
UK's hand and his hand back underneath
him. Okay.

726
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
him. Okay.
 

727
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,190
him. Okay.
So,

728
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,200

 

729
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,390

boom. Start looking for that

730
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,400
boom. Start looking for that
 

731
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:12,630
boom. Start looking for that
elbow. Not going forward. Coming back.

732
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640

 

733
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,909

Now that

734
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:14,919
Now that
 

735
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,870
Now that
said, you're going to run into the

736
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:17,880
said, you're going to run into the
 

737
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,750
said, you're going to run into the
problem. What's making him go

738
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:20,760
problem. What's making him go
 

739
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,190
problem. What's making him go
down? Because you lost your D skew. The

740
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
down? Because you lost your D skew. The
 

741
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,909
down? Because you lost your D skew. The
D cue was that he goes to his

742
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:28,919
D cue was that he goes to his
 

743
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,190
D cue was that he goes to his
knee. Okay, you lost

744
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,200
knee. Okay, you lost
 

745
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,510
knee. Okay, you lost
that. What's making him go down is the X

746
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
that. What's making him go down is the X
 

747
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,029
that. What's making him go down is the X
pattern.

748
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
pattern.
 

749
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,710
pattern.
That means his head is coming around

750
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
That means his head is coming around
 

751
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,590
That means his head is coming around
which it will because the elbow came

752
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:44,600

 

753
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,630

back. The inertia that was happening on

754
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
back. The inertia that was happening on
 

755
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,110
back. The inertia that was happening on
the spinal displacement when I bring the

756
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
the spinal displacement when I bring the
 

757
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,750
the spinal displacement when I bring the
head around makes the leg go around with

758
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
head around makes the leg go around with
 

759
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,070
head around makes the leg go around with
the centipal energy which you

760
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
the centipal energy which you
 

761
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,310
the centipal energy which you
experienced in the throw.

762
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
experienced in the throw.
 

763
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,990
experienced in the throw.
Okay. And

764
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay. And
 

765
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,630
Okay. And
then you have the third force here at

766
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
then you have the third force here at
 

767
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,070
then you have the third force here at
the hip.

768
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080

 

769
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,510

That's the

770
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,520
That's the
 

771
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,390
That's the
miashi. So that's where we're going.

772
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,400
miashi. So that's where we're going.
 

773
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,310
miashi. So that's where we're going.
Now, this

774
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:15,320
Now, this
 

775
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,909
Now, this
hip is going to be hit by this

776
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:18,919
hip is going to be hit by this
 

777
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:25,789
hip is going to be hit by this
koshi simply with the

778
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:25,799

 

779
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,110

edemi. It's nothing

780
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,120
edemi. It's nothing
 

781
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,789
edemi. It's nothing
more. Virginia, would you mind? You're

782
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
more. Virginia, would you mind? You're
 

783
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,870
more. Virginia, would you mind? You're
going to hold

784
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:31,880
going to hold
 

785
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,710
going to hold
this. Okay.

786
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
this. Okay.
 

787
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,029
this. Okay.
And you're going to when I say you're

788
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
And you're going to when I say you're
 

789
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,909
And you're going to when I say you're
going to turn his head by pulling it.

790
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
going to turn his head by pulling it.
 

791
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,390
going to turn his head by pulling it.
I'll push this to be the inertia. And

792
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
I'll push this to be the inertia. And
 

793
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,789
I'll push this to be the inertia. And
this is my cushioning. One, two,

794
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:45,799
this is my cushioning. One, two,
 

795
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,110
this is my cushioning. One, two,
three. That's all we're doing.

796
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,120
three. That's all we're doing.
 

797
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,950
three. That's all we're doing.
Okay.

798
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:51,960
Okay.
 

799
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,909
Okay.
Boom.

800
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:54,919
Boom.
 

801
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,430
Boom.
Boom. I am not having

802
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
Boom. I am not having
 

803
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,950
Boom. I am not having
therefore to push his elbow down.

804
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
therefore to push his elbow down.
 

805
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,669
therefore to push his elbow down.
He's falling. The elbow's going to come

806
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
He's falling. The elbow's going to come
 

807
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,669
He's falling. The elbow's going to come
down as gravity pulls his center of

808
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
down as gravity pulls his center of
 

809
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,190
down as gravity pulls his center of
gravity closer to the earth. Okay. I

810
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
gravity closer to the earth. Okay. I
 

811
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,470
gravity closer to the earth. Okay. I
just let it come back around me. I

812
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:15,480
just let it come back around me. I
 

813
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,510
just let it come back around me. I
push and I keep it on that trajectory of

814
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
push and I keep it on that trajectory of
 

815
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,909
push and I keep it on that trajectory of
the power line as we mentioned the

816
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
the power line as we mentioned the
 

817
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,710
the power line as we mentioned the
previous video. Okay. So, it's

818
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:25,720
previous video. Okay. So, it's
 

819
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,110
previous video. Okay. So, it's
effortless. Boom. Pop. make him fall and

820
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
effortless. Boom. Pop. make him fall and
 

821
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,149
effortless. Boom. Pop. make him fall and
aim him as he's

822
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:35,159

 

823
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:37,950

falling. When you have a

824
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:37,960
falling. When you have a
 

825
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,190
falling. When you have a
beginner, you kind of do it because he's

826
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
beginner, you kind of do it because he's
 

827
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,350
beginner, you kind of do it because he's
going to

828
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,360
going to
 

829
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,669
going to
fall. There's no there's no and you

830
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
fall. There's no there's no and you
 

831
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,270
fall. There's no there's no and you
know, I've said this many times in the

832
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
know, I've said this many times in the
 

833
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,230
know, I've said this many times in the
rest. My kids always laugh about how you

834
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
rest. My kids always laugh about how you
 

835
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,909
rest. My kids always laugh about how you
tell them how great they are at their

836
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
tell them how great they are at their
 

837
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,590
tell them how great they are at their
chem. They're they're just getting

838
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
chem. They're they're just getting
 

839
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,909
chem. They're they're just getting
thrown. I mean, they're good at keeping

840
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
thrown. I mean, they're good at keeping
 

841
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,830
thrown. I mean, they're good at keeping
their head off the mat, but they don't

842
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
their head off the mat, but they don't
 

843
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,390
their head off the mat, but they don't
have to do all the acrobatics that you

844
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
have to do all the acrobatics that you
 

845
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,390
have to do all the acrobatics that you
see all around, which, you

846
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,400
see all around, which, you
 

847
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,230
see all around, which, you
know, those people are. Those acrobatics

848
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
know, those people are. Those acrobatics
 

849
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,390
know, those people are. Those acrobatics
are impressive, but it's not iikido. My

850
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
are impressive, but it's not iikido. My
 

851
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,750
are impressive, but it's not iikido. My
people don't do that. They just get

852
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
people don't do that. They just get
 

853
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,669
people don't do that. They just get
thrown and they learn how not to die

854
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
thrown and they learn how not to die
 

855
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,350
thrown and they learn how not to die
when they hit the mat. There is talent

856
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
when they hit the mat. There is talent
 

857
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,029
when they hit the mat. There is talent
in that, okay? But it's not the

858
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,039
in that, okay? But it's not the
 

859
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:21,029
in that, okay? But it's not the
same as like Shiraava or those people

860
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
same as like Shiraava or those people
 

861
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,549
same as like Shiraava or those people
you know that have to know all this

862
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
you know that have to know all this
 

863
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,950
you know that have to know all this
choreography and be very gymnastic.

864
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:25,960
choreography and be very gymnastic.
 

865
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,549
choreography and be very gymnastic.
Okay.

866
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:27,559
Okay.
 

867
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,789
Okay.
So the

868
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:29,799
So the
 

869
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,430
So the
beginner doesn't need to know

870
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:32,440
beginner doesn't need to know
 

871
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,310
beginner doesn't need to know
anything for me to do this even slowly.

872
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
anything for me to do this even slowly.
 

873
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,990
anything for me to do this even slowly.
I just slow.

874
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000

 

875
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,549

What if you mention my my beginners are

876
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
What if you mention my my beginners are
 

877
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,070
What if you mention my my beginners are
too afraid of it? Well, don't send them

878
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
too afraid of it? Well, don't send them
 

879
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,310
too afraid of it? Well, don't send them
flying. Just do the

880
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,320
flying. Just do the
 

881
00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:05,310
flying. Just do the
geometry.

882
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,320

 

883
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,230

Boom. It looks pretty gentle. Okay. Um,

884
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
Boom. It looks pretty gentle. Okay. Um,
 

885
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,390
Boom. It looks pretty gentle. Okay. Um,
we're going to let everyone try this and

886
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
we're going to let everyone try this and
 

887
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,149
we're going to let everyone try this and
see if they have questions here and see

888
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
see if they have questions here and see
 

889
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,350
see if they have questions here and see
if we need to film another

890
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,360
if we need to film another
 

891
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,990
if we need to film another
clip. All right. So, when people see the

892
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
clip. All right. So, when people see the
 

893
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,230
clip. All right. So, when people see the
X

894
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,240
X
 

895
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,909
X
pattern, they will think of it through

896
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
pattern, they will think of it through
 

897
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,590
pattern, they will think of it through
the ego tripartite mind and they don't

898
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
the ego tripartite mind and they don't
 

899
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,029
the ego tripartite mind and they don't
understand the centripal energy is at

900
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
understand the centripal energy is at
 

901
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,070
understand the centripal energy is at
work. The centrifugal energy is at work

902
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
work. The centrifugal energy is at work
 

903
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,190
work. The centrifugal energy is at work
and the initial inertia of the spinal

904
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
and the initial inertia of the spinal
 

905
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,110
and the initial inertia of the spinal
displacement. It's these forces that are

906
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
displacement. It's these forces that are
 

907
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,669
displacement. It's these forces that are
at play and then it's a tiny

908
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:44,679
at play and then it's a tiny
 

909
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,789
at play and then it's a tiny
little bump. That's all it is. Okay. You

910
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
little bump. That's all it is. Okay. You
 

911
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,549
little bump. That's all it is. Okay. You
see the UK go flying boom, right? Boom.

912
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
see the UK go flying boom, right? Boom.
 

913
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,590
see the UK go flying boom, right? Boom.
Up high and you'll you'll go like I have

914
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
Up high and you'll you'll go like I have
 

915
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,990
Up high and you'll you'll go like I have
to do something big and it has to be uh

916
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,000
to do something big and it has to be uh
 

917
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,110
to do something big and it has to be uh
materialbased, matter based. It's not

918
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
materialbased, matter based. It's not
 

919
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,190
materialbased, matter based. It's not
matter based, it's energetic. Okay. Uh

920
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
matter based, it's energetic. Okay. Uh
 

921
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,870
matter based, it's energetic. Okay. Uh
those things have to be in place. So,

922
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
those things have to be in place. So,
 

923
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,909
those things have to be in place. So,
it's not uncommon when you now are able

924
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
it's not uncommon when you now are able
 

925
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,390
it's not uncommon when you now are able
to enter because you're not pushing them

926
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
to enter because you're not pushing them
 

927
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,230
to enter because you're not pushing them
away. You're now able to get into I like

928
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,240
away. You're now able to get into I like
 

929
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,149
away. You're now able to get into I like
to call this like a wave. So, I grew up

930
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
to call this like a wave. So, I grew up
 

931
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,190
to call this like a wave. So, I grew up
in Huntington Beach and we used to uh

932
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
in Huntington Beach and we used to uh
 

933
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,510
in Huntington Beach and we used to uh
shoot the tube all the time. And so,

934
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
shoot the tube all the time. And so,
 

935
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,909
shoot the tube all the time. And so,
there's a wave here. This hip is up

936
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
there's a wave here. This hip is up
 

937
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,590
there's a wave here. This hip is up
higher than the other hip. And that is

938
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:28,600
higher than the other hip. And that is
 

939
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,029
higher than the other hip. And that is
where my uh lead hip fits. Okay? And

940
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
where my uh lead hip fits. Okay? And
 

941
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,909
where my uh lead hip fits. Okay? And
then as I'm just entering, that's what

942
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
then as I'm just entering, that's what
 

943
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,070
then as I'm just entering, that's what
does the

944
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,080
does the
 

945
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,390
does the
displacement. Okay. You're now going to

946
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
displacement. Okay. You're now going to
 

947
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,710
displacement. Okay. You're now going to
not close the wave off because when you

948
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
not close the wave off because when you
 

949
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,110
not close the wave off because when you
when you push them, this hip is now

950
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
when you push them, this hip is now
 

951
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,029
when you push them, this hip is now
parallel to the other one and it's about

952
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
parallel to the other one and it's about
 

953
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,750
parallel to the other one and it's about
to get lower as you're going. The wave

954
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
to get lower as you're going. The wave
 

955
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,230
to get lower as you're going. The wave
closed on you. So like a new surfer,

956
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
closed on you. So like a new surfer,
 

957
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,750
closed on you. So like a new surfer,
you're like, "Dude, you missed the tube

958
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
you're like, "Dude, you missed the tube
 

959
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,750
you're like, "Dude, you missed the tube
because it it already closed on you."

960
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
because it it already closed on you."
 

961
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,669
because it it already closed on you."
Okay? There's a time and place for it,

962
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
Okay? There's a time and place for it,
 

963
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,950
Okay? There's a time and place for it,
and you have to be in the right time and

964
00:23:59,950 --> 00:23:59,960
and you have to be in the right time and
 

965
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,350
and you have to be in the right time and
place with your arm. now coming back

966
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
place with your arm. now coming back
 

967
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,950
place with your arm. now coming back
towards you. It's going to probably be

968
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:05,960
towards you. It's going to probably be
 

969
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,870
towards you. It's going to probably be
there. You're going to return to your

970
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
there. You're going to return to your
 

971
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,430
there. You're going to return to your
material thinking and you're going to

972
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
material thinking and you're going to
 

973
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,029
material thinking and you're going to
try to trip this leg underneath where

974
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
try to trip this leg underneath where
 

975
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,669
try to trip this leg underneath where
you're doing something like that. I'm

976
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
you're doing something like that. I'm
 

977
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,669
you're doing something like that. I'm
not doing

978
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:18,679
not doing
 

979
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,269
not doing
that. Or you're going to do this over

980
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
that. Or you're going to do this over
 

981
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,990
that. Or you're going to do this over
rotate. I didn't do that either. Okay.

982
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
rotate. I didn't do that either. Okay.
 

983
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,630
rotate. I didn't do that either. Okay.
All I'm doing is fitting the yang koshi

984
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
All I'm doing is fitting the yang koshi
 

985
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,430
All I'm doing is fitting the yang koshi
into this yin spot that's here. It's

986
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
into this yin spot that's here. It's
 

987
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,470
into this yin spot that's here. It's
going in. Boom. Now, you have to

988
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
going in. Boom. Now, you have to
 

989
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,310
going in. Boom. Now, you have to
remember I don't do the federite

990
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,320
remember I don't do the federite
 

991
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,830
remember I don't do the federite
koshi. I don't I'm not in the stance

992
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
koshi. I don't I'm not in the stance
 

993
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,350
koshi. I don't I'm not in the stance
where this is not very long. It stays

994
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,360
where this is not very long. It stays
 

995
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,110
where this is not very long. It stays
yin. So, when we're

996
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,120
yin. So, when we're
 

997
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,110
yin. So, when we're
here, if you enter with that stance, you

998
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
here, if you enter with that stance, you
 

999
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,510
here, if you enter with that stance, you
don't get

1000
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:54,520
don't get
 

1001
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,549
don't get
it. Remember my admi enters on the

1002
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
it. Remember my admi enters on the
 

1003
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,909
it. Remember my admi enters on the
straight and then turns in. So you have

1004
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
straight and then turns in. So you have
 

1005
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,149
straight and then turns in. So you have
that foot slightly in and that's what

1006
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
that foot slightly in and that's what
 

1007
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,549
that foot slightly in and that's what
brings it. You don't have to go past

1008
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:07,559
brings it. You don't have to go past
 

1009
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,390
brings it. You don't have to go past
that. You don't need to do a hip bump or

1010
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
that. You don't need to do a hip bump or

out they don't know what's happening and
 

1027
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,110
out they don't know what's happening and
because they feel So offbalance, it's

1028
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
because they feel So offbalance, it's
 

1029
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,350
because they feel So offbalance, it's
very common that they're going to try to

1030
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
very common that they're going to try to
 

1031
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,149
very common that they're going to try to
roll on

1032
00:25:59,149 --> 00:25:59,159
roll on
 

1033
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,750
roll on
you.

1034
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:00,760
you.
 

1035
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,029
you.
Meaning you came out and you do a roll

1036
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
Meaning you came out and you do a roll
 

1037
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,110
Meaning you came out and you do a roll
that way. Okay? And they do something

1038
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
that way. Okay? And they do something
 

1039
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,310
that way. Okay? And they do something
like

1040
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,320
like
 

1041
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,510
like
that. You're going to do a

1042
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,520

 

1043
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,230

roll. Okay?

1044
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
roll. Okay?
 

1045
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,110
roll. Okay?
First, some of you already had that

1046
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,120
First, some of you already had that
 

1047
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,710
First, some of you already had that
experience, but it was exacerbated by

1048
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
experience, but it was exacerbated by
 

1049
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,310
experience, but it was exacerbated by
you were pushing the elbow as you were

1050
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
you were pushing the elbow as you were
 

1051
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,350
you were pushing the elbow as you were
trying to do the X

1052
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,360
trying to do the X
 

1053
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,870
trying to do the X
power.

1054
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:27,880
power.
 

1055
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,269
power.
Okay? You won't get as bad roll, but you

1056
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
Okay? You won't get as bad roll, but you
 

1057
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,630
Okay? You won't get as bad roll, but you
may feel their upward pressure as they

1058
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
may feel their upward pressure as they
 

1059
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,390
may feel their upward pressure as they
try to basically resist your technique.

1060
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
try to basically resist your technique.
 

1061
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,070
try to basically resist your technique.
That's what that is. They're not letting

1062
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
That's what that is. They're not letting
 

1063
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,830
That's what that is. They're not letting
you do

1064
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
you do
 

1065
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,230
you do
uh the technique. They're violating the

1066
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
uh the technique. They're violating the
 

1067
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,070
uh the technique. They're violating the
rule of neither assisting nor resisting.

1068
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,080
rule of neither assisting nor resisting.
 

1069
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,710
rule of neither assisting nor resisting.
Okay? So, all you got to do is keep

1070
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
Okay? So, all you got to do is keep
 

1071
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,549
Okay? So, all you got to do is keep
control of the

1072
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:53,559

 

1073
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,230

elbow constantly 90° fluctuation that

1074
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,240
elbow constantly 90° fluctuation that
 

1075
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,750
elbow constantly 90° fluctuation that
energy. You would feel it in your hand

1076
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
energy. You would feel it in your hand
 

1077
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,590
energy. You would feel it in your hand
because you had to fluctuate, but no one

1078
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
because you had to fluctuate, but no one
 

1079
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,190
because you had to fluctuate, but no one
else would know that they were trying to

1080
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
else would know that they were trying to
 

1081
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,909
else would know that they were trying to
roll out. Okay? That's the ideal. So, if

1082
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919
roll out. Okay? That's the ideal. So, if
 

1083
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,390
roll out. Okay? That's the ideal. So, if
they roll out, it's not their fault. you

1084
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
they roll out, it's not their fault. you
 

1085
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,870
they roll out, it's not their fault. you
didn't 90 degree fluctuate that upward

1086
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
didn't 90 degree fluctuate that upward
 

1087
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,110
didn't 90 degree fluctuate that upward
lift into where you need them to go.

1088
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,120
lift into where you need them to go.
 

1089
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,269
lift into where you need them to go.
Okay. All right. Here I I told Sean and

1090
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
Okay. All right. Here I I told Sean and
 

1091
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,669
Okay. All right. Here I I told Sean and
Virginia to purposely try to roll out of

1092
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
Virginia to purposely try to roll out of
 

1093
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,549
Virginia to purposely try to roll out of
it. And we're going to watch

1094
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:23,559
it. And we're going to watch
 

1095
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:43,770

Ronin go ahead and 90° fluctuate.

1096

energy in them trying to do it, but it

1104
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
energy in them trying to do it, but it
 

1105
