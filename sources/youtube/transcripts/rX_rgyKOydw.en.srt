I'm Christopher Hine and this week we're
talking about HUD again so how do

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,740
literally means belly power which sounds
kind of like a weird way to describe

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:21,750
kind of like a weird way to describe
 

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,150
kind of like a weird way to describe
something but in general it has to do

something but in general it has to do
 

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,920
something but in general it has to do
with the alignments and the way I used

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:24,930
with the alignments and the way I used
 

15
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,420
with the alignments and the way I used
my body usually we're talking about

16
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,430
my body usually we're talking about
 

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,730
my body usually we're talking about
creating strength so what makes me very

18
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:28,740
creating strength so what makes me very
 

19
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,410
creating strength so what makes me very
strong and either when I'm resisting

20
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,420
strong and either when I'm resisting
 

21
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,599
strong and either when I'm resisting
force or making force how can I use this

22
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,609
force or making force how can I use this

how to get in a special way so but how

24
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,440
how to get in a special way so but how
 

25
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,410
how to get in a special way so but how
do you get kind of a blanket term so how

26
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:36,420
do you get kind of a blanket term so how
 

27
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,029
do you get kind of a blanket term so how
do you could literally be translated as

28
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:38,039
do you could literally be translated as
 

29
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,829
do you could literally be translated as
belly power or the power that comes from

30
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:39,839
belly power or the power that comes from
 

31
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,169
belly power or the power that comes from
being in front of my belly and that is

32
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:42,179
being in front of my belly and that is
 

33
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,209
being in front of my belly and that is
to say that my hands work strongest

34
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:44,219
to say that my hands work strongest
 

35
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,009
to say that my hands work strongest
right here so my hands are in front of

36
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:46,019
right here so my hands are in front of
 

37
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,450
right here so my hands are in front of
me that's where they work the strongest

38
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,460
me that's where they work the strongest
 

39
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,579
me that's where they work the strongest
and with the most Xterra t as my hands

40
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:49,589
and with the most Xterra t as my hands
 

41
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:50,899
and with the most Xterra t as my hands
start to get away from my Center I

42
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:50,909
start to get away from my Center I
 

43
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,149
start to get away from my Center I
become weaker and also much less

44
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:53,159
become weaker and also much less
 

45
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,459
become weaker and also much less
dexterous so in order to have the

46
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,469
dexterous so in order to have the
 

47
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,289
dexterous so in order to have the
strongest body alignment I should always

48
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:57,299
strongest body alignment I should always
 

49
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,849
strongest body alignment I should always
have my hands in front of my Center in

50
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:58,859
have my hands in front of my Center in
 

51
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,799
have my hands in front of my Center in
addition to that idea of just my hands

52
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:00,809
addition to that idea of just my hands
 

53
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,599
addition to that idea of just my hands
being stronger here and giving me more

54
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:02,609
being stronger here and giving me more
 

55
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,090
being stronger here and giving me more
dexterity the shorter my arm levers can

56
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,100
dexterity the shorter my arm levers can
 

57
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,130
dexterity the shorter my arm levers can
be then the stronger I'll be I'm going

58
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,140
be then the stronger I'll be I'm going
 

59
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,480
be then the stronger I'll be I'm going
to give you an example of that with

60
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,490
to give you an example of that with
 

61
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,370
to give you an example of that with
Sasha here all right so let me bring

62
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,380
Sasha here all right so let me bring
 

63
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,320
Sasha here all right so let me bring
Sasha my arm and I want you to grab

64
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,330
Sasha my arm and I want you to grab
 

65
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,030
Sasha my arm and I want you to grab
ahold of my wrist and push my arm down

66
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,040
ahold of my wrist and push my arm down
 

67
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,140
ahold of my wrist and push my arm down
so I'm gonna hold my arm out I'm gonna

68
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,150
so I'm gonna hold my arm out I'm gonna
 

69
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,820
so I'm gonna hold my arm out I'm gonna
resist you strongly as I possibly can

70
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:22,830
resist you strongly as I possibly can
 

71
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,560
resist you strongly as I possibly can
and go ahead and push my arm down and

72
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,570
and go ahead and push my arm down and
 

73
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,240
and go ahead and push my arm down and
I'm persisting as hard as I can okay so

74
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,250
I'm persisting as hard as I can okay so
 

75
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,210
I'm persisting as hard as I can okay so
at this lever link right so with this

76
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,220
at this lever link right so with this
 

77
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,860
at this lever link right so with this
lever right here sausage the burying of

78
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:30,870
lever right here sausage the burying of
 

79
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,240
lever right here sausage the burying of
that lever and so I'm someone weighs a

80
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,250
that lever and so I'm someone weighs a
 

81
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,830
that lever and so I'm someone weighs a
hundred pounds I weigh twice that right

82
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
hundred pounds I weigh twice that right
 

83
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,510
hundred pounds I weigh twice that right
it's hard for me to keep her from

84
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
it's hard for me to keep her from
 

85
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,740
it's hard for me to keep her from
pushing my hand out she has enough

86
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:36,750
pushing my hand out she has enough
 

87
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,630
pushing my hand out she has enough
strength to push my hand in if I were to

88
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
strength to push my hand in if I were to
 

89
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,100
strength to push my hand in if I were to
move in here and she were to do the same

90
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,110
move in here and she were to do the same
 

91
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,690
move in here and she were to do the same
thing at my shoulder when she pushes

92
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,700
thing at my shoulder when she pushes
 

93
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,250
thing at my shoulder when she pushes
down you can see that she can almost

94
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,260
down you can see that she can almost
 

95
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,350
down you can see that she can almost
lift herself up on me because I have

96
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
lift herself up on me because I have
 

97
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,670
lift herself up on me because I have
enough strength to hold her up like that

98
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
enough strength to hold her up like that
 

99
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,190
enough strength to hold her up like that
right so when she's on the close side of

100
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
right so when she's on the close side of
 

101
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
right so when she's on the close side of
the lever I'm much stronger apparently

102
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:51,810
the lever I'm much stronger apparently
 

103
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,480
the lever I'm much stronger apparently
than when she set the long side lever so

104
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,490
than when she set the long side lever so
 

105
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,740
than when she set the long side lever so
this is just basically the principle of

106
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:54,750
this is just basically the principle of
 

107
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,480
this is just basically the principle of
leverage so if sausage sticks your arm

108
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,490
leverage so if sausage sticks your arm
 

109
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,590
leverage so if sausage sticks your arm
out here like this go ahead oh is this

110
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
out here like this go ahead oh is this
 

111
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
out here like this go ahead oh is this
as hard as I can I'm gonna push your

112
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:58,890
as hard as I can I'm gonna push your
 

113
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,030
as hard as I can I'm gonna push your
hand down not very hard okay if I try to

114
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040
hand down not very hard okay if I try to
 

115
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,160
hand down not very hard okay if I try to
push up here when I push down this is

116
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,170
push up here when I push down this is
 

117
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,590
push up here when I push down this is
much harder and that's because this her

118
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
much harder and that's because this her
 

119
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,960
much harder and that's because this her
arm is working as a lever arm and that

120
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:08,970
arm is working as a lever arm and that
 

121
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,639
arm is working as a lever arm and that
means anything at a clip down here is

122
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:10,649
means anything at a clip down here is
 

123
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,910
means anything at a clip down here is
gonna be a lot more

124
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
gonna be a lot more
 

125
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,199
gonna be a lot more
for her muscle sort against than

126
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,209
for her muscle sort against than
 

127
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,210
for her muscle sort against than
anything I put here the closer I am to

128
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,220
anything I put here the closer I am to
 

129
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,860
anything I put here the closer I am to
the fulcrum of the lever then the

130
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:16,870
the fulcrum of the lever then the
 

131
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,140
the fulcrum of the lever then the
stronger she will appear to be if when

132
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,150
stronger she will appear to be if when
 

133
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,610
stronger she will appear to be if when
we bring a device in here so if Josh

134
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:20,620
we bring a device in here so if Josh
 

135
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,350
we bring a device in here so if Josh
brings that pedal down all right so we

136
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
brings that pedal down all right so we
 

137
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
brings that pedal down all right so we
have a 35 pound kettlebell here

138
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,090
have a 35 pound kettlebell here
 

139
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,130
have a 35 pound kettlebell here
what's also gonna do is hold it right

140
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,140
what's also gonna do is hold it right
 

141
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,900
what's also gonna do is hold it right
here in front of her body like this now

142
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:30,910
here in front of her body like this now
 

143
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,309
here in front of her body like this now
if Sasha were to move it off to either

144
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
if Sasha were to move it off to either
 

145
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,890
if Sasha were to move it off to either
the right or left you can see she

146
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:34,900
the right or left you can see she
 

147
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,330
the right or left you can see she
started to have a really hard time

148
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,340
started to have a really hard time
 

149
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,440
started to have a really hard time
holding it up she doesn't want to hold

150
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,450
holding it up she doesn't want to hold
 

151
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,120
holding it up she doesn't want to hold
it there very long because it's so heavy

152
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,130
it there very long because it's so heavy
 

153
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,280
it there very long because it's so heavy
but by making these levers short like

154
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,290
but by making these levers short like
 

155
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,630
but by making these levers short like
this and holding it right in the center

156
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
this and holding it right in the center
 

157
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,340
this and holding it right in the center
of her body she's able to hold a much

158
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,350
of her body she's able to hold a much
 

159
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,660
of her body she's able to hold a much
heavier weight than she would be able to

160
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:45,670
heavier weight than she would be able to
 

161
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,170

working and also shortens my lever arms
then of course I'm having if my arms out

184
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:09,489
then of course I'm having if my arms out

here like this I'm trying to do

186
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:10,630
here like this I'm trying to do
 

187
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,910
here like this I'm trying to do
something way out here that it's gonna

188
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
something way out here that it's gonna
 

189
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,410
something way out here that it's gonna
be way harder than it would be if I keep

190
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,420
be way harder than it would be if I keep
 

191
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,880
be way harder than it would be if I keep
my hands in here and that's just simply

192
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:14,890
my hands in here and that's just simply
 

193
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,590
my hands in here and that's just simply
where I'm putting the load in relation

194
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,600
where I'm putting the load in relation
 

195
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,270
where I'm putting the load in relation
to the fulcrum so if I'm lifting from my

196
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,280
to the fulcrum so if I'm lifting from my
 

197
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,250
to the fulcrum so if I'm lifting from my
shoulder here anything that's in here

198
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,260
shoulder here anything that's in here
 

199
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,140
shoulder here anything that's in here
that's closer to my shoulder will be

200
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,150
that's closer to my shoulder will be
 

201
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,090
that's closer to my shoulder will be
easier for me to live anytime that

202
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,100
easier for me to live anytime that
 

203
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,530
easier for me to live anytime that
weight starts to get away from my

204

weight starts to get away from my
 

205
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,789
weight starts to get away from my
shoulder which is where the fulcrum is

206
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
shoulder which is where the fulcrum is
 

207
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,470
shoulder which is where the fulcrum is
it's gonna be harder and harder for me

208
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
it's gonna be harder and harder for me
 

209
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,390
it's gonna be harder and harder for me
to hold so this basic concept of

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
to hold so this basic concept of
 

211
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,949
to hold so this basic concept of
leverage is key to when we're talking

212
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:31,959
leverage is key to when we're talking
 

213
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,680
leverage is key to when we're talking
about how to eat
