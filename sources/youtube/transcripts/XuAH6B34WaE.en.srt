00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,069
okay but what's his balance
do okay so when you're like this it

386
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079

 

387
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,230

goate

388
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240

[Music]

392
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680

 

393
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,389

is he got his color tie and let's look

394
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
is he got his color tie and let's look
 

395
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,990
is he got his color tie and let's look
at it come closer see he's going to

396
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,000
at it come closer see he's going to
 

397
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,829
at it come closer see he's going to
Anchor his elbow so that he can't

398
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:36,839
Anchor his elbow so that he can't
 

399
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,430
Anchor his elbow so that he can't
control my penetration range and then

400
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
control my penetration range and then
 

401
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,710
control my penetration range and then
he's hooking on the back here then he

402
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:41,720
he's hooking on the back here then he
 

403
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,230
he's hooking on the back here then he
controls that range too you got it okay

404
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,240
controls that range too you got it okay
 

405
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,750
controls that range too you got it okay
so you have to deal with that anchored

406
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
so you have to deal with that anchored
 

407
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,030
so you have to deal with that anchored
elbow all right so he he got it I'm

to try to pull and I'm ground vectory on
 

425
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,189
to try to pull and I'm ground vectory on
the front leg you see ground vectory on

426
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:22,199
the front leg you see ground vectory on
 

427
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,230
the front leg you see ground vectory on
the front leg done it okay I can't be

428
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,240
the front leg done it okay I can't be
 

429
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,990
the front leg done it okay I can't be
here you're going to going to get me

430
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000

 

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,590

and I can't just be athletic cuz that's

432
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:32,600
and I can't just be athletic cuz that's
 

433
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,230
and I can't just be athletic cuz that's
where you can move me around and stuff

434
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
where you can move me around and stuff
 

435
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,069
where you can move me around and stuff
so I have to ground Vector right and

436
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:37,079
so I have to ground Vector right and
 

437
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,949
so I have to ground Vector right and
move him off the front

438
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:39,959
move him off the front
 

439
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,350
move him off the front
foot okay so we'll start static I'm

440
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
foot okay so we'll start static I'm
 

441
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,230
foot okay so we'll start static I'm
going here and let's just do a

442
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,240
going here and let's just do a
 

443
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,590
going here and let's just do a
progression so you're just going to have

444
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
progression so you're just going to have
 

445
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,870
progression so you're just going to have
them try to pull and you're on the front

446
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
them try to pull and you're on the front
 

447
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,230
them try to pull and you're on the front
foot you're just pulling into the front

448
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
foot you're just pulling into the front
 

449
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,069
foot you're just pulling into the front
foot next progression go ahead and just

450
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:55,079
foot next progression go ahead and just
 

451
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,990
foot next progression go ahead and just
move him off the front foot okay we'll

452
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
move him off the front foot okay we'll
 

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:15,389
move him off the front foot okay we'll
try that then we'll build

454
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:15,399

 

455
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,430

as he going the deeper he is into that

456
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:18,440
as he going the deeper he is into that
 

457
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,949
as he going the deeper he is into that
the harder this is going to be the

458
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:19,959
the harder this is going to be the
 

459
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,870
the harder this is going to be the
harder this is going to be okay so you

460
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:21,880
harder this is going to be okay so you
 

461
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,310
harder this is going to be okay so you
do the same thing on the mod you see

462
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
do the same thing on the mod you see
 

463
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,069
do the same thing on the mod you see
where I where I got it it's not it's not

464
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
where I where I got it it's not it's not
 

465
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,030
where I where I got it it's not it's not
as anchored okay so same on the pull and

466
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,040
as anchored okay so same on the pull and
 

467
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,470
as anchored okay so same on the pull and
find that center it's much easier to do

468
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480
find that center it's much easier to do
 

469
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,670
find that center it's much easier to do
okay so get to there and you're doing

470
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:36,680
okay so get to there and you're doing
 

471
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,470
okay so get to there and you're doing
the

472
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,480
the
 

473
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,629
the
same you can do it on the

474
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
same you can do it on the
 

475
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:50,829
same you can do it on the
turn get him to move okay let's

476
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:50,839

 

477
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:59,030

try keep
