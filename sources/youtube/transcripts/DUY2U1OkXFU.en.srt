1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:22,550

so

2
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560

 

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:37,590

so

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600

 

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,750

okay so my

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
okay so my
 

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,430
okay so my
my center

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
my center
 

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,190
my center
is dependent upon

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
is dependent upon
 

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,350
is dependent upon
the periphery right

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
the periphery right
 

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,430
the periphery right
and in this case what makes up the

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
and in this case what makes up the
 

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,750
and in this case what makes up the
periphery

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
periphery
 

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,029
periphery
my head and my feet hence our rule

18
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
my head and my feet hence our rule
 

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,830
my head and my feet hence our rule
if my head goes down

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
if my head goes down
 

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,069
if my head goes down
at least one foot has to come up this is

22
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
at least one foot has to come up this is
 

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,229
at least one foot has to come up this is
a breaking a center

24
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
a breaking a center
 

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,310
a breaking a center
okay yes i still have a center of

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
okay yes i still have a center of
 

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,469
okay yes i still have a center of
gravity but in terms of the spiraling

28
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
gravity but in terms of the spiraling
 

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,070
gravity but in terms of the spiraling
rotating cross

30
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
rotating cross
 

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,109
rotating cross
i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay

32
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay
 

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,710
i'm not doing it in my body anymore okay
so my

34
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
so my
 

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,710
so my
body stays locked

36
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
body stays locked
 

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,350
body stays locked
and i do that same thing

38
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
and i do that same thing
 

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,469
and i do that same thing
this whole thing is going to rotate

40
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
this whole thing is going to rotate
 

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,550
this whole thing is going to rotate
not on a circle

42
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
not on a circle
 

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,630
not on a circle
has to go on a spiral

44
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
has to go on a spiral
 

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,590
has to go on a spiral
okay

46
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
okay
 

47
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,350
okay
which means it must seek some sort of

48
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
which means it must seek some sort of
 

49
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,630
which means it must seek some sort of
traversing vector it must have some sort

50
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
traversing vector it must have some sort
 

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,230
traversing vector it must have some sort
of depth okay

52
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
of depth okay
 

53
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,429
of depth okay
so

54
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
so
 

55
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,789
so
my

56
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
my
 

57
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,030
my
body's going to go this way my body's

58
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
body's going to go this way my body's
 

59
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,870
body's going to go this way my body's
going to go that way my body's not going

60
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
going to go that way my body's not going
 

61
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,350
going to go that way my body's not going
to go this way okay i think that's part

62
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
to go this way okay i think that's part
 

63
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,030
to go this way okay i think that's part
of the problem

64
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
of the problem
 

65
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,550
of the problem
um

66
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
um
 

67
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,389
um
is is why you have to disengage that

68
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
is is why you have to disengage that
 

69
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,550
is is why you have to disengage that
tail bone at the end because there's no

70
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
tail bone at the end because there's no
 

71
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,710
tail bone at the end because there's no
room for it you have to get your legs

72
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
room for it you have to get your legs
 

73
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,590
room for it you have to get your legs
back under you you understand so you

74
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
back under you you understand so you
 

75
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,910
back under you you understand so you
start you roll in this way

76
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
start you roll in this way
 

77
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,749
start you roll in this way
and there's no

78
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
and there's no
 

79
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,749
and there's no
there's no room for your legs so you're

80
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
there's no room for your legs so you're
 

81
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,870
there's no room for your legs so you're
going to bend your knees a lot

82
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
going to bend your knees a lot
 

83
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,630
going to bend your knees a lot
and disengage the tailbone

84
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
and disengage the tailbone
 

85
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,270
and disengage the tailbone
this kind of thing but i don't do that

86
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
this kind of thing but i don't do that
 

87
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,389
this kind of thing but i don't do that
because

88
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
because
 

89
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,150
because
i have depth

90
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
i have depth
 

91
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,150
i have depth
my legs are out my legs are at home

92
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
my legs are out my legs are at home
 

93
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,070
my legs are out my legs are at home
you see how my legs are out

94
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
you see how my legs are out
 

95
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,270
you see how my legs are out
watch my legs again lock my body lock my

96
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
watch my legs again lock my body lock my
 

97
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,600
watch my legs again lock my body lock my
body boom

98
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,610

 

99
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,070

[Music]

100
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
[Music]
 

101
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,630
[Music]
okay let's try it again

102
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
okay let's try it again
 

103
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,070
okay let's try it again
so again if i go straight

104
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
so again if i go straight
 

105
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,790
so again if i go straight
then his forward roll any forward roll

106
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
then his forward roll any forward roll
 

107
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,430
then his forward roll any forward roll
kind of works any forward over okay

108
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440

 

109
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,550

but if i am trying to do the spiraling

110
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
but if i am trying to do the spiraling
 

111
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,710
but if i am trying to do the spiraling
cross geometry

112
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
cross geometry
 

113
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,949
cross geometry
it doesn't go on a circle it's going to

114
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
it doesn't go on a circle it's going to
 

115
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,430
it doesn't go on a circle it's going to
go on a spiral it's going to

116
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
go on a spiral it's going to
 

117
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,630
go on a spiral it's going to
seek depth

118
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640

 

119
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,309

and then come around

120
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
and then come around
 

121
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,589
and then come around
it's not going to go straight it's not

122
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
it's not going to go straight it's not
 

123
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,190
it's not going to go straight it's not
going to get straight i'm going to go

124
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
going to get straight i'm going to go
 

125
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,710
going to get straight i'm going to go
straight

126
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
straight
 

127
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:32,710
straight
it's one big spiraling rock

128
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720

 

129
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,229

he's feeling

130
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
he's feeling
 

131
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,390
he's feeling
a young young

132
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
a young young
 

133
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,229
a young young
clap so to speak

134
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
clap so to speak
 

135
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,550
clap so to speak
on your part his projection

136
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
on your part his projection
 

137
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,229
on your part his projection
okay

138
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
okay
 

139
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,430
okay
so

140
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
so
 

141
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,430
so
we come around

142
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
we come around
 

143
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,710
we come around
and if he goes straight

144
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
and if he goes straight
 

145
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,910
and if he goes straight
i could do whatever

146
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920

 

147
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,190

but when he does that spiral

148
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
but when he does that spiral
 

149
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,589
but when he does that spiral
i have to seek

150
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
i have to seek
 

151
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,750
i have to seek
that depth

152
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
that depth
 

153
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,030
that depth
and

154
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
and
 

155
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,869
and
a yang yin yin yang reconciliation

156
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
a yang yin yin yang reconciliation
 

157
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,750
a yang yin yin yang reconciliation
okay

158
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
okay
 

159
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,990
okay
so instead of going here

160
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
so instead of going here
 

161
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,030
so instead of going here
and going

162
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040

 

163
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,270

i would look at why did i feel your

164
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
i would look at why did i feel your
 

165
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,990
i would look at why did i feel your
elbow

166
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000

 

167
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,390

and you felt my elbow too

168
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
and you felt my elbow too
 

169
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,469
and you felt my elbow too
so we'll go so you can see it slow so

170
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
so we'll go so you can see it slow so
 

171
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,150
so we'll go so you can see it slow so
you can feel it

172
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
you can feel it
 

173
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,830
you can feel it
it's right there you

174
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
it's right there you
 

175
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,469
it's right there you
see

176
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
see
 

177
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,430
see
but watch me go around

178
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440

um if i
 

279
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,749
um if i
establish a relationship to my head feet

280
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
establish a relationship to my head feet
 

281
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,990
establish a relationship to my head feet
then i establish a center you see the

282
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
then i establish a center you see the
 

283
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,710
then i establish a center you see the
periphery is related to each other

284
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
periphery is related to each other
 

285
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,029
periphery is related to each other
then the center is established that

286
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
then the center is established that
 

287
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,070
then the center is established that
means

288
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
means
 

289
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,550
means
that's as heavy as i'm going to get

290
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560

when i walk around
 

295
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,749
when i walk around
or i break center

296
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
or i break center
 

297
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,270
or i break center
i'm very light

298
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
i'm very light
 

299
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,350

about is that she has my whole magazine
 

311
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,710
about is that she has my whole magazine
as my whole mass jacked her up okay

312
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
as my whole mass jacked her up okay
 

313
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,629
as my whole mass jacked her up okay
whereas if i would lose

314
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
whereas if i would lose
 

315
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,710
whereas if i would lose
and lose she can do it

316
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
and lose she can do it
 

317
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,230
and lose she can do it
incrementally

318
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
incrementally
 

319
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,710
incrementally
but if i have my

320
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
but if i have my
 

321
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,870
but if i have my
periphery related

322
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
periphery related
 

323
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,510
periphery related
and center this is very

324
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520

 

325
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,150

and it starts to expose things

326
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
and it starts to expose things
 

327
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,670
and it starts to expose things
in her technique

328
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
in her technique
 

329
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,070
in her technique
now all i do is maintain center

330
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080

 

331
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,710

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
um
 

359
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,720
um
watch my face

360
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:12,730

um
 

367
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,749
um
let's try it again

368
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
let's try it again
 

369
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,830
let's try it again
okay so the question is

370
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
okay so the question is
 

371
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,270
okay so the question is
what is the growth stimulus training

372
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
what is the growth stimulus training
 

373
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,909
what is the growth stimulus training
your uk or you came at mine and you guys

374
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
your uk or you came at mine and you guys
 

375
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,469
your uk or you came at mine and you guys
nailed it it's way faster and now the

376
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
nailed it it's way faster and now the
 

377
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,430
nailed it it's way faster and now the
question is why is it faster

378
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
question is why is it faster
 

379
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,750
question is why is it faster
and you said

380
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
and you said
 

381
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,750
and you said
we usually are having energy right okay

382
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
we usually are having energy right okay
 

383
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,149
we usually are having energy right okay
you're adding energy to it so

384
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
you're adding energy to it so
 

385
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,550
you're adding energy to it so
diagnose how is the energy being added

386
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
diagnose how is the energy being added
 

387
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,710
diagnose how is the energy being added
to it

388
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720

 

389
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,790

we're not just taking vagus growth we

390
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
we're not just taking vagus growth we
 

391
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,550
we're not just taking vagus growth we
are putting ourselves towards them i

392
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
are putting ourselves towards them i
 

393
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,949
are putting ourselves towards them i
would say no you are being accelerated

394
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
would say no you are being accelerated
 

395
00:08:50,959 --> 00:09:00,949
would say no you are being accelerated
where is your acceleration point

396
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959

 

397
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,110

set the elbow

398
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
set the elbow
 

399
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,870
set the elbow
your elbows being accelerated into the

400
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
your elbows being accelerated into the
 

401
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,630
your elbows being accelerated into the
technique

402
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
technique
 

403
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,190
technique
how is that doable if you're resisting

404
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
how is that doable if you're resisting
 

405
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,949
how is that doable if you're resisting
with the elbow yeah you have a young

406
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
with the elbow yeah you have a young
 

407
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,990
with the elbow yeah you have a young
young contact point there you get it so

408
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
young contact point there you get it so
 

409
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,150
young contact point there you get it so
you'll you'll feel you'll feel it as we

410
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
you'll you'll feel you'll feel it as we
 

411
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,910
you'll you'll feel you'll feel it as we
go right here

412
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920

 

413
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,389

feel when it goes off here it's on on

414
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
feel when it goes off here it's on on
 

415
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,150
feel when it goes off here it's on on
and off

416
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
and off
 

417
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,630
and off
and i just do that from the start

418
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
and i just do that from the start
 

419
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,710
and i just do that from the start
this goes boom

420
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720

 

421
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,110

so my roll

422
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
so my roll
 

423
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,389
so my roll
is not accelerating

424
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
is not accelerating
 

425
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,389
is not accelerating
i don't get projected

426
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
i don't get projected
 

427
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,910
i don't get projected
my roll

428
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
my roll
 

429
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,590
my roll
if we go slow

430
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
if we go slow
 

431
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,030
if we go slow
slower

432
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
slower
 

433
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,550
slower
you see
