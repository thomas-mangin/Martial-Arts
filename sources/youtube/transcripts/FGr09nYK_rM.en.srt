1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:15,490

foreign

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:15,500

 

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,349

is trying to stop him right do you see

4
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
is trying to stop him right do you see
 

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:27,589
is trying to stop him right do you see
that

6
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599

 

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,030

stopping stopping

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,040

 

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,410

So eventually he's going to get through

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:33,420
So eventually he's going to get through
 

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,790
So eventually he's going to get through
like that

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:37,800

 

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,670

so as I said

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
so as I said
 

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,090
so as I said
if if I have to stop him and he wants to

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
if if I have to stop him and he wants to
 

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,950
if if I have to stop him and he wants to
come forward

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
come forward
 

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,069
come forward
so rather than stop him it's it's as

20
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
so rather than stop him it's it's as
 

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,549
so rather than stop him it's it's as
he's pushing that angle you take him to

22
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
he's pushing that angle you take him to
 

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,790
he's pushing that angle you take him to
the tilt

24
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:55,800

 

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,990

not here but take it into the tilt

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000

 

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,329

if this is an easy one is just take it

28
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:05,339
if this is an easy one is just take it
 

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,969
if this is an easy one is just take it
into a tilt

30
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:07,979
into a tilt
 

31
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,590
into a tilt
now you can do different things with

32
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
now you can do different things with
 

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,850
now you can do different things with
this hat

34
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:10,860
this hat
 

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,230
this hat
you see

36
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
you see
 

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,649
you see
so he's in it till he'll respond to it

38
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
so he's in it till he'll respond to it
 

39
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,969
so he's in it till he'll respond to it
into the other two

40
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:19,979

 

41
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,530

he pushes tilt

42
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:24,540

 

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,890

push his tilt

44
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:27,900

 

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,230

push his tilt

46
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240

 

47
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,910

not here

48
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
not here
 

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,730
not here
eventually he's gonna get me

50
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:37,740
eventually he's gonna get me
 

51
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,649
eventually he's gonna get me
so he pushes tilts tilts

52
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:42,659

 

53
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,929

so if you look at this hand I came

54
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:44,939
so if you look at this hand I came
 

55
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,910
so if you look at this hand I came
around this way he went around the

56
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:46,920
around this way he went around the
 

57
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,069
around this way he went around the
outside and then I just stayed on the

58
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
outside and then I just stayed on the
 

59
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,270
outside and then I just stayed on the
inside

60
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
inside
 

61
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,730
inside
but the difference was that as he did

62
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:52,740
but the difference was that as he did
 

63
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,069
but the difference was that as he did
that this time I brought into the Tilt

64
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
that this time I brought into the Tilt
 

65
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,270
that this time I brought into the Tilt
do you see

66
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,280
do you see
 

67
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,609
do you see
and then I can use his hand now

68
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:01,619

 

69
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,209

so again he was pushing

70
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:05,219
so again he was pushing
 

71
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,630
so again he was pushing
so I just pushed that hand there his

72
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
so I just pushed that hand there his
 

73
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,210
so I just pushed that hand there his
hand attempted to counter I stay on the

74
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
hand attempted to counter I stay on the
 

75
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,030
hand attempted to counter I stay on the
inside out it goes

76
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
inside out it goes
 

77
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,930
inside out it goes
so if you look you push I just went and

78
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:17,940
so if you look you push I just went and
 

79
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,210
so if you look you push I just went and
took it in but it's kind of stuck do you

80
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,220
took it in but it's kind of stuck do you
 

81
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,250
took it in but it's kind of stuck do you
feel it it's kind of stuck are you

82
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,260
feel it it's kind of stuck are you
 

83
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,970
feel it it's kind of stuck are you
pushing push it gets stuck

84
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:25,980
pushing push it gets stuck
 

85
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,930
pushing push it gets stuck
on the other one right I'm trying to

86
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:29,940
on the other one right I'm trying to
 

87
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,750
on the other one right I'm trying to
take it he goes around the outside I

88
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
take it he goes around the outside I
 

89
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,010
take it he goes around the outside I
don't care I'll figure it out it doesn't

90
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,020
don't care I'll figure it out it doesn't
 

91
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,809
don't care I'll figure it out it doesn't
matter if you change it okay so this

92
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
matter if you change it okay so this
 

93
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,610
matter if you change it okay so this
time it went on this way I'd come around

94
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:37,620
time it went on this way I'd come around
 

95
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,130
time it went on this way I'd come around
this way

96
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,140

 

97
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,350

pushing

98
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
pushing
 

99
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,690
pushing
I'm on the inside

100
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm on the inside
 

101
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,490
I'm on the inside
John came this way he went around the

102
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,500
John came this way he went around the
 

103
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,309
John came this way he went around the
outside I stayed on the inside okay do

104
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
outside I stayed on the inside okay do
 

105
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,150
outside I stayed on the inside okay do
you feel the same friction

106
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,160

 

107
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,970

so yeah but not here

108
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
so yeah but not here
 

109
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,350
so yeah but not here
so let's look at it he is coming around

110
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
so let's look at it he is coming around
 

111
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,190
so let's look at it he is coming around
I'm here

112
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm here
 

113
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,990
I'm here
so let's look at that little circle

114
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,000
so let's look at that little circle
 

115
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,050
so let's look at that little circle
there's my yield but it's taking him

116
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,060
there's my yield but it's taking him
 

117
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,630
there's my yield but it's taking him
into that tilt do you see and once you

118
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
into that tilt do you see and once you
 

119
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,910
into that tilt do you see and once you
have one part of the Tilt here's where

120
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
have one part of the Tilt here's where
 

121
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,890
have one part of the Tilt here's where
the Coq on the x pattern works

122
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:15,900

 

123
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,589

now imagine I did that same one I'll

124
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:18,599
now imagine I did that same one I'll
 

125
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,970
now imagine I did that same one I'll
figure I don't know if I'm doing the

126
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:19,980
figure I don't know if I'm doing the
 

127
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,610
figure I don't know if I'm doing the
same thing here but I don't do this hand

128
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:22,620
same thing here but I don't do this hand
 

129
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,550
same thing here but I don't do this hand
into the tail I don't know I hold him up

130
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,560
into the tail I don't know I hold him up
 

131
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,009
into the tail I don't know I hold him up
and he's trying to go around this hand

132
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:28,019
and he's trying to go around this hand
 

133
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,750
and he's trying to go around this hand
you're trying to go around this hand

134
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
you're trying to go around this hand
 

135
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,030
you're trying to go around this hand
you're pushing on this hand I'm holding

136
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040
you're pushing on this hand I'm holding
 

137
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,470
you're pushing on this hand I'm holding
you there look

138
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
you there look
 

139
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,830
you there look
he goes around this hand it won't be the

140
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
he goes around this hand it won't be the
 

141
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,350
he goes around this hand it won't be the
same thing you see that it will not be

142
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
same thing you see that it will not be
 

143
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,289
same thing you see that it will not be
the same thing it's this part that made

144
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:42,299
the same thing it's this part that made
 

145
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,330
the same thing it's this part that made
it work okay

146
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,340
it work okay
 

147
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,050
it work okay
so again as he goes I don't push I don't

148
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
so again as he goes I don't push I don't
 

149
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,570
so again as he goes I don't push I don't
stop him where does he want to go I can

150
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,580
stop him where does he want to go I can
 

151
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,330
stop him where does he want to go I can
feel him you see I can feel him go that

152
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:53,340
feel him you see I can feel him go that
 

153
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,850
feel him you see I can feel him go that
way so I let him go that way this is

154
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:55,860
way so I let him go that way this is
 

155
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:03,949
way so I let him go that way this is
letting him go that way

156
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959

 

157
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,750

I don't know why you put yourself in a

158
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
I don't know why you put yourself in a
 

159
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,449
I don't know why you put yourself in a
wrist lock but okay

160
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:11,459

 

161
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,789

no tilt you see

162
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:13,799
no tilt you see
 

163
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,050
no tilt you see
same thing till

164
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,060

 

165
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,469

okay so you gotta hit that tilt can't be

166
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:21,479
okay so you gotta hit that tilt can't be
 

167
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,050
okay so you gotta hit that tilt can't be
sit sitting up right he's up right here

168
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,060
sit sitting up right he's up right here
 

169
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,290
sit sitting up right he's up right here
kind of just moving his arms around okay

170
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,300
kind of just moving his arms around okay
 

171
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,990
kind of just moving his arms around okay

Maneuvers all all day long okay

226
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,060

 

227
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,990

all right so Andrew I would say what's

228
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
all right so Andrew I would say what's
 

229
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,510
all right so Andrew I would say what's
happening is is you have an external

230
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
happening is is you have an external
 

231
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,990
happening is is you have an external
yield but you have to be your yield

232
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
yield but you have to be your yield
 

233
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,210
yield but you have to be your yield
remember has to be in the center do you

234
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,220
remember has to be in the center do you
 

235
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,430

feel that do you see
I'm not going he pushes I go like that

238
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm not going he pushes I go like that
 

239
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,469
I'm not going he pushes I go like that
not just getting out of the way I

240
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:27,479
not just getting out of the way I
 

241
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,110
not just getting out of the way I
immediately touch his Center so when he

242
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,120
immediately touch his Center so when he
 

243
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,430
immediately touch his Center so when he
counters

244
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
counters
 

245
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,469
counters
you can keep touching anything

246
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:33,479
you can keep touching anything
 

247
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,809
you can keep touching anything
okay

248
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:34,819
okay
 

249
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,430
okay
oh touch his Center

250
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
oh touch his Center
 

251
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,770
oh touch his Center
then it'll work

252
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
then it'll work
 

253
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,290
then it'll work
just here won't work because he starts

254
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,300
just here won't work because he starts
 

255
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,969
just here won't work because he starts
leaning on you

256
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:43,979
leaning on you
 

257
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,249
leaning on you
which is what you want because that

258
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:46,259
which is what you want because that
 

259
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,650
which is what you want because that
makes his Center but if you're external

260
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,660
makes his Center but if you're external
 

261
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,110
makes his Center but if you're external
he's leaning on you he's actually going

262
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
he's leaning on you he's actually going
 

263
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,129
he's leaning on you he's actually going
to push push on you externally okay but

264
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,139
to push push on you externally okay but
 

265
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,290
to push push on you externally okay but
you do want

266
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,300
you do want
 

267
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,450
you do want
because what the UK does is they feel

268
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,460
because what the UK does is they feel
 

269
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,969
because what the UK does is they feel
that and then he starts using me for

270
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:01,979
that and then he starts using me for
 

271
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,249
that and then he starts using me for
balance and that's good because you can

272
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:04,259
balance and that's good because you can
 

273
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,770
balance and that's good because you can
just stop you see that that's what I

274
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:06,780
just stop you see that that's what I
 

275
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,490
just stop you see that that's what I
mean like I don't I don't my goal is not

276
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,500
mean like I don't I don't my goal is not
 

277
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,029
mean like I don't I don't my goal is not
to overpower him so I wouldn't want to

278
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,039
to overpower him so I wouldn't want to
 

279
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,210
to overpower him so I wouldn't want to
push him out of his fall

280
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,220
push him out of his fall
 

281
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,850
push him out of his fall
so when he's totally leading on you he's

282
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:19,860
so when he's totally leading on you he's
 

283
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,730
so when he's totally leading on you he's
falling you just take away the handrail

284
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:22,740
falling you just take away the handrail
 

285
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,430
falling you just take away the handrail
and they'll fall okay

286
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
and they'll fall okay
 

287
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,629
and they'll fall okay
so

288
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
so
 

289
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,909
so
same thing there's the push there's the

290
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
same thing there's the push there's the
 

291
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:46,070
same thing there's the push there's the
center

292
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080

 

293
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,650

always in the center you see that never

294
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660
always in the center you see that never
 

295
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,990
always in the center you see that never
out on his arms never out on his arms

296
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,000
out on his arms never out on his arms
 

297
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,670
out on his arms never out on his arms
and then I pull the arm and eventually

298
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:52,680
and then I pull the arm and eventually
 

299
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,589
and then I pull the arm and eventually
his shoulder and then eventually the

300
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:54,599
his shoulder and then eventually the
 

301
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,330
his shoulder and then eventually the
center that's not it

302
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:56,340
center that's not it
 

303
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,309
center that's not it
always in the center always

304
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
always in the center always
 

305
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,730
always in the center always
in the center

306
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:07,740

 

307
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,550

okay let's try it again

308
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
okay let's try it again
 

309
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,390
okay let's try it again
foreign

310
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:17,400

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,020
of leaning forward do you see that and
 

331
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,870
of leaning forward do you see that and
is he resists and tries to keep his

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,870
you could have someone I guess who is
like driving and you get out of the way

502
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:41,880
like driving and you get out of the way
 

503
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,290
like driving and you get out of the way
do you see and then I fall into it

504
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:45,300
do you see and then I fall into it
 

505
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,110
do you see and then I fall into it
yes okay but it's probably not going to

506
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,120
yes okay but it's probably not going to
 

507
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,290
yes okay but it's probably not going to
be Tristan okay

508
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,300
be Tristan okay
 

509
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,069
be Tristan okay
um

510
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
um
 

511
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,490
um
so that's where that adhesion is gonna

512
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,500
so that's where that adhesion is gonna
 

513
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,310
so that's where that adhesion is gonna
come in okay and because I need the

514
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
come in okay and because I need the
 

515
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,430
come in okay and because I need the
friction I need that the

516
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
friction I need that the
 

517
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,150
friction I need that the
the stuckness okay so as you're trying

518
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,160
the stuckness okay so as you're trying
 

519
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,670
the stuckness okay so as you're trying
to touch me uh I am sticky you see

520
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:10,680
to touch me uh I am sticky you see
 

521
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,810
to touch me uh I am sticky you see
sticky and so uh with the stickiness

522
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:14,820
sticky and so uh with the stickiness
 

523
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,949
sticky and so uh with the stickiness
then the person who's maybe I'm holding

524
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
then the person who's maybe I'm holding
 

525
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,310
then the person who's maybe I'm holding
up do you think or the person who's not

526
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
up do you think or the person who's not
 

527
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,069
up do you think or the person who's not
going to give that much opening I can

528
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:25,079
going to give that much opening I can
 

529
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,990
going to give that much opening I can
get just an inch

530
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,000
get just an inch
 

531
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,170
get just an inch
using and this is literally a game of

532
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,180
using and this is literally a game of
 

533
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,269
using and this is literally a game of
inches all right

534
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
inches all right
 

535
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,550
inches all right
so if I push I'll be over young and I

536
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,560
so if I push I'll be over young and I
 

537
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,710
so if I push I'll be over young and I
won't be sticky except at the right

538
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,720
won't be sticky except at the right
 

539
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,530
won't be sticky except at the right
angles so as soon as he tried you try to

540
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,540
angles so as soon as he tried you try to
 

541
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,870
angles so as soon as he tried you try to
get off of that right angle you see I I

542
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
get off of that right angle you see I I
 

543
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,750
get off of that right angle you see I I
you felt that little slip there okay uh

544
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
you felt that little slip there okay uh
 

545
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,550
you felt that little slip there okay uh
and then what happened we'll do that one

546
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:49,560
and then what happened we'll do that one
 

547
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,590
and then what happened we'll do that one
again so on the right angle of course

548
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
again so on the right angle of course
 

549
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,569
again so on the right angle of course
I'm stuck but once you get off the right

550
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:53,579
I'm stuck but once you get off the right
 

551
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,670
I'm stuck but once you get off the right
angle look where I ended up okay do you

552
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
angle look where I ended up okay do you
 

553
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,750
angle look where I ended up okay do you
see and that was what was happening a

554
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:56,760
see and that was what was happening a
 

555
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,389
see and that was what was happening a
lot to you okay and remember in this

556
00:13:59,389 --> 00:13:59,399
lot to you okay and remember in this
 

557
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,730
lot to you okay and remember in this
game because I want to understand the

game because I want to understand the
 

559
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,889
game because I want to understand the
keyho noaza testabaki I want to float
