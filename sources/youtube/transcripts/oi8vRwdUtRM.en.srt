00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
dichotomy and what happens in every
 

503
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,870
dichotomy and what happens in every
single valid viable religious system is

504
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:01,880
single valid viable religious system is
 

505
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,110
single valid viable religious system is
they play with

506
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,120
they play with
 

507
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,350
they play with
dichotomy so outside will act like

508
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
dichotomy so outside will act like
 

509
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,470
dichotomy so outside will act like
inside down will act like up okay there

510
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,480
inside down will act like up okay there
 

511
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,590
inside down will act like up okay there
that this is why your greatest

512
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:14,600
that this is why your greatest
 

513
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,990
that this is why your greatest
religious um figures are always

514
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,000
religious um figures are always
 

515
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,069
religious um figures are always
subversive to the institution the

516
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:19,079
subversive to the institution the
 

517
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,790
subversive to the institution the
institution can't take that kind of

518
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
institution can't take that kind of
 

519
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,470
institution can't take that kind of
stuff okay so we have Shag in this

520
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,480
stuff okay so we have Shag in this
 

521
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,910
stuff okay so we have Shag in this
technique and as I watched uh all those

522
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:28,920
technique and as I watched uh all those
 

523
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,949
technique and as I watched uh all those
high ranking people do Shon they

524
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:31,959
high ranking people do Shon they
 

525
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,030
high ranking people do Shon they
actually did standard

526
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,040
actually did standard
 

527
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,030
actually did standard
Shon okay and in this technique you're

528
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
Shon okay and in this technique you're
 

529
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,749
Shon okay and in this technique you're
not going to do standard Shon you're

530
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:39,759
not going to do standard Shon you're
 

531
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,470
not going to do standard Shon you're
going to have the external aspect of

532
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:43,480
going to have the external aspect of
 

533
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,150
going to have the external aspect of
shon but you're using it more to throw

534
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
shon but you're using it more to throw
 

535
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,990
shon but you're using it more to throw
them backwards okay

536
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
them backwards okay
 

537
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,430
them backwards okay
not turn and do an angle cancellation

538
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
not turn and do an angle cancellation
 

539
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,710
not turn and do an angle cancellation
going forward and that's where the

540
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:55,720
going forward and that's where the
 

541
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,389
going forward and that's where the
biggest mistake is that I saw as people

542
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
biggest mistake is that I saw as people
 

543
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,870
biggest mistake is that I saw as people
did did standard

544
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
did did standard
 

545
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,870
did did standard
shag they brought themselves between the

546
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:03,880
shag they brought themselves between the
 

547
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,269
shag they brought themselves between the
two UK and then they remain in front of

548
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
two UK and then they remain in front of
 

549
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,150
two UK and then they remain in front of
the two and they have to push them okay

550
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
the two and they have to push them okay
 

551
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,670
the two and they have to push them okay
so if we

552
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
so if we
 

553
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,189
so if we
look

554
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
look
 

555
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,829
look
martially you have two people here come

556
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
martially you have two people here come
 

557
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,990
martially you have two people here come
grab okay they stay there now without

558
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,000
grab okay they stay there now without
 

559
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,150
grab okay they stay there now without
the grab okay so here I

560
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,160
the grab okay so here I
 

561
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,470
the grab okay so here I
am and as they move into standard shag

562
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:31,480
am and as they move into standard shag
 

563
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,990
am and as they move into standard shag
so you have you're you're going to see

564
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
so you have you're you're going to see
 

565
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,829
so you have you're you're going to see
that

566
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
that
 

567
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,949
that
okay back in that X

568
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
okay back in that X
 

569
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,269
okay back in that X
Vector so it makes no sense martially to

570
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:44,279
Vector so it makes no sense martially to
 

571
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,990
Vector so it makes no sense martially to
enter here in the middle of them you

572
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,000
enter here in the middle of them you
 

573
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,430
enter here in the middle of them you
would you would never do that even

574
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
would you would never do that even
 

575
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,389
would you would never do that even
though it looks like you got through on

576
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,399
though it looks like you got through on
 

577
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,430
though it looks like you got through on
that

578
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
that
 

579
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,990
that
side

580
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,000
side
 

581
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,150
side
but if you make one guy go here your

582
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,160
but if you make one guy go here your
 

583
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,550
but if you make one guy go here your
initial Emi is now not in the middle of

584
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
initial Emi is now not in the middle of
 

585
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,629
initial Emi is now not in the middle of
them and when you ten con you can see

586
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:05,639
them and when you ten con you can see
 

587
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,790
them and when you ten con you can see
that they're lined up now you guys see

588
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800

 

589
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,710

that so I have to figure some way of not

590
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:15,720
that so I have to figure some way of not
 

591
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,629
that so I have to figure some way of not
putting myself in the middle which is

592
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:17,639
putting myself in the middle which is
 

593
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,309
putting myself in the middle which is
never right

594
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:20,319
never right
 

595
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,230
never right
okay and now we'll reverse engineer the

596
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,240
okay and now we'll reverse engineer the
 

597
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,350
okay and now we'll reverse engineer the
technique so I know he's going to go

598
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,360
technique so I know he's going to go
 

599
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,430
technique so I know he's going to go
this way and I know he's going to turn

600
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
this way and I know he's going to turn
 

601
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,910
this way and I know he's going to turn
this way

602
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:32,920

 

603
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,670

okay and I know that they're going to be

604
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:36,680
okay and I know that they're going to be
 

605
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,269
okay and I know that they're going to be
this

606
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:38,279
this
 

607
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,389
this
way and I know they're going to do a

608
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
way and I know they're going to do a
 

609
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,150
way and I know they're going to do a
back

610
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,160
back
 

611
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,509
back
rall so in order to do a back

612
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:44,519
rall so in order to do a back
 

613
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,470
rall so in order to do a back
breakfall I am not going to push them

614
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
breakfall I am not going to push them
 

615
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,069
breakfall I am not going to push them
got that I know they have to be falling

616
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,079
got that I know they have to be falling
 

617
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:57,110
got that I know they have to be falling
that way when I in does that make sense

618
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
that way when I in does that make sense
 

619
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,030
that way when I in does that make sense
so that is is more reason why I'm not

620
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
so that is is more reason why I'm not
 

621
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,269
so that is is more reason why I'm not
going to go

622
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
going to go
 

623
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,150
going to go
here do

624
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,160
here do
 

625
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,720
here do
this because now I'm pushing

626
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:07,730
this because now I'm pushing
 

627
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,750
this because now I'm pushing

I am going to take sh and not take him

634
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
I am going to take sh and not take him
 

635
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,350
I am going to take sh and not take him
forward I'm going to take sh Naga and

636
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
forward I'm going to take sh Naga and
 

637
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,190
forward I'm going to take sh Naga and
bring him backward

638
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,200

 

639
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,669

that's immediately going to

640
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
that's immediately going to

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,950
that's immediately going to

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:41,960

 

643
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,029

my I'll do it again and so you can make

644
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
my I'll do it again and so you can make
 

645
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,310
my I'll do it again and so you can make
sure you see it so I'm going to make him

646
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
sure you see it so I'm going to make him
 

647
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,549
sure you see it so I'm going to make him
move past me which is always what you do

648
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:51,559
move past me which is always what you do
 

649
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,590
move past me which is always what you do
in

650
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,600
in
 

651
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,669
in
EDI martially for you to edem me he has

652
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:56,679
EDI martially for you to edem me he has
 

653
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,669
EDI martially for you to edem me he has
to be moving forward

654
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:00,679

 

655
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,230

so I make him go forward around me and

656
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
so I make him go forward around me and
 

657
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,990
so I make him go forward around me and
they hit each

658
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
they hit each
 

659
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,789
they hit each
other so different for what I've seen

660
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
other so different for what I've seen
 

661
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,230
other so different for what I've seen
I'm using him to hit

662
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm using him to hit
 

663
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,630
I'm using him to hit
him instead of I go here come around and

664
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
him instead of I go here come around and
 

665
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,430
him instead of I go here come around and
then pull on him to hit Ron that's not

666
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
then pull on him to hit Ron that's not

is if he pushes into

1006
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
is if he pushes into
 

1007
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,190
is if he pushes into
me that is how weak it is for me to

1008
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
me that is how weak it is for me to
 

1009
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,070
me that is how weak it is for me to
torque him as as much as it is unstable

1010
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,080
torque him as as much as it is unstable
 

1011
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,909
torque him as as much as it is unstable
against his push it is unstable for me

1012
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
against his push it is unstable for me
 

1013
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,029
against his push it is unstable for me
to

1014
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
to
 

1015
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,750
to
torque so

1016
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
torque so
 

1017
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,029
torque so
mine go

1018
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:18,039
mine go
 

1019
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,590
mine go
e ten con and I'm

1211
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,109
find cuz my people here found that it's
very difficult to do and the reason that

1212
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:50,119
very difficult to do and the reason that
 

1213
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,270

I am detecting is that you smell the

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
I am detecting is that you smell the
 

1215
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,670
I am detecting is that you smell the
propulsion engine okay and then you go

1216
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:56,680
propulsion engine okay and then you go
 

1217
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,910

for it so let me first note the

1218

for it so let me first note the
 

1219
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,670
