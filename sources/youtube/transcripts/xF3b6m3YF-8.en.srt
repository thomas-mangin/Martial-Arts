tension go away and then he will be

76
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,470
tension go away and then he will be
 

77
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,800
tension go away and then he will be
affected by that and he stops pushing

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:20,810
affected by that and he stops pushing
 

79
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,250

like to see of course those that need
this integrity but the other ones you

152
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:42,990
this integrity but the other ones you
 

153
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,200
this integrity but the other ones you
need to try to relax his it's all of
