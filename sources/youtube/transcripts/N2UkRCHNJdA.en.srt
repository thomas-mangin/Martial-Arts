1
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:12,999
How did you start Aikido?

2
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:21,334
I used to practice judo quite regularly at the Kodokan.

3
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:26,167
My house was in front of Yasukuni Shrine in the Chiyoda district,

4
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:30,999
so it was very close to Suidobashi, where the Kodokan was.

5
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,999
So I started going there when I was a child.

6
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:44,999
When I was in high school, I became friends with the son of the late Mr. Danzaki,

7
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:56,999
the president of Iaido Federation, who had also been a Sumo fighter.

8
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,999
So because he was a sumo fighter,

9
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:07,000
I heard that Ueshiba Sensei could throw Tenryu, a Sumo wrestler who used to go to Hombu Dojo.

10
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:14,999
So via that connection, I was introduced and invited to visit the dojo.

11
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,999
I think it was 5 or 6 p.m.

12
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:24,792
Tada Sensei was teaching, he was 3rd Dan at the time.

13
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:29,999
There were 5 or 6 people training.

14
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:42,999
It was still the time where refugees from the war were living in the dojo,

15
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:50,167
one third of the dojo served as their living quarters.

16
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,209
Aikido was not well known.

17
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,250
It was during the fall in my last year of high school.

18
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,250
As I was about to leave, Tada Sensei told me to join the dojo if I liked it.

19
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,292
So I did it at the end of April, after I started university.

20
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:17,292
This is how I got to know about Aikido.

21
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:22,999
Aikido and Daito-ryu were not well known then...

22
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:28,999
Most people didn’t know such thing as koryu jujutsu

23
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:33,999
however, jukendo, and karate were widely known.

24
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:40,999
Western wrestling was also popular,

25
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:47,959
but koryu jujutsu was not a thing at that time.

26
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,083
Aikido wasn't known either.

27
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:58,999
I joined the dojo in April 1955,

28
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:03,501
and Aikido was first shown to the public in September that same year

29
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:08,000
on the roof of the Takashimaya department store.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,999
I was a newcomer then so I just helped with carrying tatami,

31
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:17,999
but that was the first time aikido was performed in public.

32
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:23,209
Isoyama Sensei told me that the term "Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu", not "Aikido" was written on his Iwama registration documents.

33
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:29,999
At Hombu Dojo, people registered the same way as they do now.

34
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:35,999
They didn’t keep records.

35
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:48,999
Well, I joined in 1955.

36
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:56,876
There were usually 5 to 10 people during the classes at the Hombu Dojo.

37
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:01,999
Kisshomaru Sensei was still working at a security firm.

38
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:06,999
Tada Sensei was the subsitute teacher.

39
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:19,999
Two years later, around 1957,

40
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,999
Kisshomaru Sensei started to run Aikido full time.

41
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:32,999
We started to have more training sessions after that.

42
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:43,751
Practice used to be in the mornings at 6:30, as well as during the evenings.

43
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:50,999
We adopted the current 5-classes schedule after Kisshomaru Sensei quit his job.

44
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:55,999
What made you decide to become a deshi at Hombu?

45
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:04,999
Well, Hombu was close to my house,

46
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,999
I did Judo,

47
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:19,999
the Kodokan was a big organization so there were no interactions between its members.

48
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:28,999
Hombu wasn't like this, and we would have tea before or after training

49
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,250
we would do calligraphy together,

50
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,999
and we would go out drinking at night.

51
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,999
It was interesting to hang out with people.

52
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,999
The uchideshi all came from the countryside

53
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,999
so they were different and they thought completely differently,

54
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,292
even at the same age.

55
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,999
It was interesting.

56
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:55,999
That was the main reason why I quit the Kodokai and opted for Aikido.

57
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,000
Human interactions and friendship among uchi deshi.

58
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,999
It was chaotic.

59
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:15,751
When there was no training, we were free to do anything, like drinking at night.

60
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:22,999
Of course we would clean up and do grocery shopping

61
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:26,999
but there was no space to practice during off hours

62
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,667
because people were still there, hanging around.

63
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:35,000
They would do sumo and arm wrestling

64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,999
and go out for a drink at night as it was close to Shinjuku.

65
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:47,209
We had senpai-kohai relationships

66
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:53,999
and those who had money, usually senpais, would pay.

67
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,999
When some of us received money from their parents, we would go drinking.

68
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:15,999
At some point we were living and eating with Ueshiba Sensei.

69
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:21,999
We didn’t have to worry about anything but getting food to eat.

70
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,999
How was the practice among uchi deshi?

71
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,999
It was rough because everyone was young.

72
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,999
We were testing each other, saying that techniques were not working, or that they didn't hurt.

73
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:44,999
I wasn't not big so I did circular motions to get my opponents tired.

74
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:50,459
I would also get up quickly after being thrown.

75
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,999
But I guess that was good for training.

76
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:00,999
Which teachers influenced you the most?

77
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,999
Different teachers had different ways of thinking.

78
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:14,999
There were some aspects that I found excellent, and others that I didn’t quite agree with.

79
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:28,999
Those different teachers helped me become who I am now.

80
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,999
Also, there wasn't a uniform set of techniques.

81
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:39,999
I think that’s why Aikido developed.

82
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:47,999
Well I was an assistant for Tohei Koichi Sensei for more than 10 years,

83
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,709
in different places,

84
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,999
so I was influenced by him too.

85
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:57,999
I found his way of thinking wonderful.

86
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:03,417
But there was one thing that I didn’t quite agree with.

87
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:09,999
My parents had a business

88
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:20,834
and they taught me to respect my origins,

89
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,999
that’s why I remained at Hombu.

90
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:38,999
Tohei Sensei left the dojo on March 31st.

91
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:44,999
I was sitting in the office when they left,

92
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,999
and Kisshomaru Sensei looked at me and said: “Oh you are still here Kobayashi?”

93
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:53,125
I guess he though that  I would leave too since I was Tohei Sensei's assistant.

94
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,999
But yeah, I thank my parents for teaching me.

95
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:07,999
I think we have to respect our origins.

96
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:12,999
Were there Dan examinations at the time?

97
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:16,999
No there was no such thing.

98
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,999
We didn't have tests.

99
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,999
Once per year, during kagamibiraki,

100
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,250
new Dan promotions were put up on the walls.

101
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,999
But when more people came,

102
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:40,999
we established a certification system.

103
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:46,999
If O Sensei no longer gave grades himself, what does it take to call oneself a student of O Sensei?

104
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,999
Well, it was informal in my time

105
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,999
and I think one could be considered the student of a sensei if they respected him.

106
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:59,999
In terms of training, there are different ideologies.

107
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:07,999
As far as how many years, there’s no fixed period.

108
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:12,999
Some people would only meet him during seminars, especially in the countryside.

109
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,999
O Sensei would tour the regions.

110
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,999
Travelling was not as convenient as it is now too.

111
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:24,999
There used to be a seminar once a year in March.

112
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,000
We had a week off from training at Hombu,

113
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,167
and there was only O Sensei's training.

114
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:40,999
There were teachers who only came during those times.

115
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:44,417
So I don’t know.

116
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:51,999
I think it’s enough to say that one was a follower of Ueshiba.

117
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:02,999
Did you meet the pioneers of European Aikido such as Mochizuki Minoru or Abe Tadashi?

118
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:11,999
Mochizuki Minoru Sensei was the uncle of the friend, with whom I started an Aikido club at Meiji University.

119
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:19,999
He was one or two years below me.

120
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:23,999
So we went to university camps together.

121
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,125
I have a picture of it over there.

122
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:36,999
We did two university training camps at Mochizuki Sensei's dojo in Shizuoka.

123
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:42,999
When Mochizuki Sensei came to Hombu Dojo, nobody else knew him personally

124
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:47,209
so I got to talk to him a lot.

125
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:55,417
Mochizuki Sensei had been sent to Ueshiba Sensei by Kano Sensei.

126
00:16:55,417 --> 00:17:04,999
Kano Sensei couldn't invite Ueshiba Sensei to the Kodokan so he sent Mochizuki Sensei.

127
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:16,999
I think Mochizuki Sensei had some conflicting ideas with Ueshiba Sensei

128
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:29,709
regarding how to perform Aikido when he went abroad.

129
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:36,417
Abe Sensei had a short temper and would easily get into fights.

130
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:43,999
Apparently there were some incidents abroad as well.

131
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,999
But that's because of this that they could go to whole new places and promote Aikido.

132
00:17:47,999 --> 00:18:03,501
I knew them both personally though not for so long,

133
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:10,999
and I respect them as the people who created paths to the new world.

134
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:16,417
Did you ever consider going abroad like they or some of your peers did?

135
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:29,999
People before me went abroad, like America and Europe, but I didn't.

136
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,999
I liked the practice of Aikido as it was and Iwas just doing that.

137
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:39,999
Then one day I was called by the head teacher, Tohei Koichi

138
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:47,876
and he talked about Burma, nowadays' Myanmar.

139
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,999
Yamaguchi Sensei was already there.

140
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:58,999
Because Japan had caused troubles in South East Asia during the world war two,

141
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:05,999
we were compensating them since we lost.

142
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:14,999
As part of that, Yamaguchi Sensei was staying there for two years,

143
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:18,999
and I was asked if I would go there as an assistant.

144
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,999
I said: "Whatever" and Tohei Sensei said: "Whatever is not an answer!!"

145
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,334
"Are you going or not!?”

146
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,999
So I said: "OK, I'm going."

147
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,999
But I didn’t want to go

148
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,999
so I kept procrastinating going to the embassy.

149
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,999
Three months later, there was a coup d'état

150
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:43,999
and the country went under the military regime,

151
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,999
so they stopped inviting foreign teachers.

152
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:56,626
Conversely they sent five soldiers to Japan to learn judo and aikido

153
00:19:56,626 --> 00:20:00,999
and I was in charge of taking care of them.

154
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:12,999
Perhaps I was meant to stay in Japan to practice.

155
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:20,999
I liked the practice itself.

156
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:26,751
Actually, I didn’t think of teaching until I opened the dojo.

157
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:34,999
Now that I think of it, it worked out fine and we have this place for communication.

158
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,999
To be honest,

159
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:44,999
most of the people who went abroad hadn't been training for that long.

160
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:49,999
They went abroad when they were in their 30's so they had trained for about 10 years.

161
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:55,209
But the fact that they promoted aikido that much,

162
00:20:55,209 --> 00:21:00,999
they must have had some intense training in such a short period.

163
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:08,083
I think that’s what made it possible, with everyone’s talent.

164
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,999
Interestingly,

165
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,999
they developped different characteristics according to the country that went to.

166
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:25,501
Those who went to France were more social and those who went to Germany like Asai liked order.

167
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:36,999
Those who went to the country that didn’t suit them were rejected and came back, or went somewhere else.

168
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:41,999
So the shihans who stayed there, and there are many of them,

169
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:50,999
are the ones that could adapt themselves to the country or the place they went to.

170
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:55,459
But there are also many that couldn’t adjust and who came back.

171
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,459
Talking about pioneers, do you remember Andre Nocquet?

172
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:06,999
Mr. Nocquet was the first foreigner to become an uchi deshi.

173
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,999
He ate and slept in the Dojo with the rest of us.

174
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:16,999
He was much older than us, I think he was over 40 then.

175
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:19,999
He was admirable, he worked hard for 2 years.

176
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:26,999
It was at a time when we didn’t have many foreigners in Japan

177
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:35,999
but he stayed with us at the dojo for 2 years.
