00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,849
okay so just just using this heel toe
knee step heel toe knee step okay and as

you get better at it once you get deeper
and deeper anything I want you to remain

8
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
and deeper anything I want you to remain

on the other leg
 

169
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,950
on the other leg
that's key so sometimes you get too high

170
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:45,960
that's key so sometimes you get too high
 

171
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,310
that's key so sometimes you get too high
on the glute area and you start to dry

172
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
on the glute area and you start to dry
 

173
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,650
on the glute area and you start to dry
well you can step out widen your base

174
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,660
well you can step out widen your base
 

175
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,110
well you can step out widen your base
you see

176
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,120
you see
 

177
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,930
you see
the goal there is that I don't let him

178
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
the goal there is that I don't let him
 

179
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,290
the goal there is that I don't let him
put his face of support back under his

180
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,300
put his face of support back under his
 

181
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,370
put his face of support back under his
line of gravity so it can't be on the

182
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,380
line of gravity so it can't be on the
 

183
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,890
line of gravity so it can't be on the
glute or especially for a static eye or

184
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:06,900
glute or especially for a static eye or
 

185
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,749
glute or especially for a static eye or
just under the glute because he can

186
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:08,759
just under the glute because he can
 

187
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,990
just under the glute because he can
still widen his face so I kind of go

188
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
still widen his face so I kind of go
 

189
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,430
still widen his face so I kind of go
here and I monitor what he's doing so as

190
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
here and I monitor what he's doing so as
 

191
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,370
here and I monitor what he's doing so as
I push and I feel him step it says I'm

192
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:19,380

here I just do this cap and I keep
 

197
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,290
here I just do this cap and I keep
driving

198
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:27,300

 

199
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,790

without kicking his legs up

200
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800

 

201
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,090

dry

202
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,100

pop and drop so I pop drop walk in
everything's the same

218
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,280

 

219
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,330

walk

220
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,340

 

221
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,390

clear

222
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400

 

223
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,510

pop

224
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520

 

225
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:41,600

let's go

226
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,610

229
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,689

so he drives this time when I take the

230
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
so he drives this time when I take the
 

231
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,150
so he drives this time when I take the
wind and turns right and maybe I'm

232
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
wind and turns right and maybe I'm
 

233
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,249
wind and turns right and maybe I'm
trying to shove him down to a knee so he

234
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:07,259
trying to shove him down to a knee so he
 

235
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,129

245
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,570

he pushes I turn that's the key right

246
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:29,580
he pushes I turn that's the key right
 

247
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,529
he pushes I turn that's the key right
there

248
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:33,539

vapor lock you'll get the knee kick in
 

271
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,330
vapor lock you'll get the knee kick in
there so go slow today remember I'll try

272
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:02,340
there so go slow today remember I'll try
