00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,390
how
okay so um you got to keep your

52
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
okay so um you got to keep your
 

53
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,590
okay so um you got to keep your
handshake and we've defined things so I

54
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
handshake and we've defined things so I
 

55
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,590
handshake and we've defined things so I
have we've already defined that and we

56
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:30,600
have we've already defined that and we
 

57
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,230
have we've already defined that and we
know we have the inward spiral and we

58
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
know we have the inward spiral and we
 

59
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,630
know we have the inward spiral and we
have the outer spiral and we gave you

60
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
have the outer spiral and we gave you
 

61
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,950
have the outer spiral and we gave you
clear markers on it which is that the on

62
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:39,960
clear markers on it which is that the on
 

63
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,870
clear markers on it which is that the on
the in spiral the

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
wrist and the elbow are in a different
 

67
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,389
wrist and the elbow are in a different
part of the Spiral meaning they're not

68
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
part of the Spiral meaning they're not
 

69
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,389
part of the Spiral meaning they're not
on a circle where they make a

70
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399
on a circle where they make a
 

71
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,149
on a circle where they make a
curvature at the same

72
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
curvature at the same
 

73
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,190

time the RIS go go first the elbow

74
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
time the RIS go go first the elbow
 

75
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,029
time the RIS go go first the elbow
starts it afterwards inward spiral on

76
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:05,039
starts it afterwards inward spiral on
 

77
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,630
starts it afterwards inward spiral on
the outward spiral the elbow goes first

78
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:07,640
the outward spiral the elbow goes first
 

79
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,350
the outward spiral the elbow goes first
the wrist per second okay so hence we

80
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,360
the wrist per second okay so hence we
 

81
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,350
the wrist per second okay so hence we
don't have these shapes we don't have

82
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
don't have these shapes we don't have
 

83
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,150
don't have these shapes we don't have
that

84
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
that
 

85
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,830
that
shape we don't have this

86
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:18,840
shape we don't have this
 

87
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,030
shape we don't have this
shape okay got the

88
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
shape okay got the
 

89
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,270
shape okay got the
idea um we don't have this

90
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
idea um we don't have this
 

91
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,670
idea um we don't have this
shape those aren't the shapes we

shape those aren't the shapes we
 

93
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,550

though you smell them you got them you
 

151
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,149
though you smell them you got them you
smell it you still are going to do elbow

152

smell it you still are going to do elbow
 

153
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,350
smell it you still are going to do elbow
in elbow in wrist in you're still going

that do you guys understand
 

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,829
that do you guys understand
that what I did not okay so his grip is

234
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
that what I did not okay so his grip is
 

235
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,710
that what I did not okay so his grip is
a hole

236
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:29,720
a hole
 

237
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,389
a hole
you

238
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
you
 

239
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,910
you
see and then you're going to try to push

240
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
see and then you're going to try to push
 

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,030
see and then you're going to try to push
through this

242
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
through this
 

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,069
through this
scrip that doesn't make sense cuz he can

244
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
scrip that doesn't make sense cuz he can
 

245
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,350
scrip that doesn't make sense cuz he can
let

246
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
let
 

247
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,590
let
go and I don't get anything or I slip

248
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,600
go and I don't get anything or I slip
 

249
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,190
go and I don't get anything or I slip
through and I lose energy do you get

250
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
through and I lose energy do you get
 

251
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,870
through and I lose energy do you get
that so I

252
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:49,880
that so I
 

253
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,150
that so I
get that there it

254
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
get that there it
 

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,150
get that there it
is and you want to push you want to push

256
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
is and you want to push you want to push
 

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,710
is and you want to push you want to push
through this do you see that

258
00:09:59,710 --> 00:09:59,720
through this do you see that
 

259
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,630
through this do you see that
but that's where you're going to make

260
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,640
but that's where you're going to make
 

261
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,230
but that's where you're going to make
your UK

262
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,240
your UK
 

263
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,870
your UK
Aquabat you right he's got to make sure

264
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:05,880
Aquabat you right he's got to make sure
 

265
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,389
Aquabat you right he's got to make sure
I don't push through cuz he's going to

266
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
I don't push through cuz he's going to
 

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,990
I don't push through cuz he's going to
ride it and bounce and put his head

268
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
ride it and bounce and put his head
 

269
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,470
ride it and bounce and put his head
upside down do you understand do you get

270
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:13,480
upside down do you understand do you get
 

271
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,350
upside down do you understand do you get
that that if your Uka has to be acrobat

272
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,360
that that if your Uka has to be acrobat
 

273
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,069
that that if your Uka has to be acrobat
then the attacker is not going

274
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
then the attacker is not going
 

275
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,310
then the attacker is not going
to be

276
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
to be
 

277
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,230
to be
there okay

278
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
there okay
 

279
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,990
there okay
so then that's actually what we do to

280
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000
so then that's actually what we do to
 

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,550
so then that's actually what we do to
get out of the technique we actually are

282
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:29,560
get out of the technique we actually are
 

283
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,790
get out of the technique we actually are
relying on that so when you're doing

284
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
relying on that so when you're doing
 

285
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,190
relying on that so when you're doing
this thing you're

286
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
this thing you're
 

287
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,150
this thing you're
not shoving through the grip and then he

288
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
not shoving through the grip and then he
 

289
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,310
not shoving through the grip and then he
held on you're changing you're changing

290
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,320
held on you're changing you're changing
 

291
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,990
held on you're changing you're changing
what you're doing in the

292
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
what you're doing in the
 

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,150
what you're doing in the
spiral you are going to

294
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,160
spiral you are going to
 

295
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,030
spiral you are going to
load the

296
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
load the
 

297
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,430
load the
elbow I'm going to exaggerate what it's

298
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
elbow I'm going to exaggerate what it's
 

299
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,710
elbow I'm going to exaggerate what it's
like so you see this this is what it's

300
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:55,720
like so you see this this is what it's
 

301
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,910
like so you see this this is what it's
like that and that happens

302
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
like that and that happens
 

303
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,670
like that and that happens
that happens in the grip if I stop here

304
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
that happens in the grip if I stop here
 

305
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,110
that happens in the grip if I stop here
I'm in the grip I have to keep turning

306
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
I'm in the grip I have to keep turning
 

307
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,829
I'm in the grip I have to keep turning
the wrist and the elbow into the

308
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
the wrist and the elbow into the
 

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:20,190
the wrist and the elbow into the
technique till I get akin to

310
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,200

 

311
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,350

that through the

312
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,360
that through the
 

313
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,509
that through the
grip energy

314
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:24,519
grip energy
 

315
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,430

321
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,180

again you feel the push

322
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,190
