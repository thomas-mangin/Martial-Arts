uh on the chico okay

6
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:08,099
uh on the chico okay
 

7
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,390
uh on the chico okay
so in Chico

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,400
so in Chico
 

9
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,610
so in Chico
um

10
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:13,620

 

11
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,770

you're you don't want to roll your

12
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:15,780
you're you don't want to roll your
 

13
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,970
you're you don't want to roll your
patella

14
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:16,980
patella
 

15
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,710
patella
you don't want to roll it

16
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
you don't want to roll it
 

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,990
you don't want to roll it
do you see that you don't you don't want

18
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,000
do you see that you don't you don't want
 

19
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,429
do you see that you don't you don't want
your patella to go like that

20
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439

 

21
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,130

and so most of the

22
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
and so most of the
 

23
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,009
and so most of the
the distance that you think you need to

24
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:31,019
the distance that you think you need to
 

25
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,269
the distance that you think you need to
move

27
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,690
move
is not achieved on straight lines okay

28
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,700
is not achieved on straight lines okay
 

29
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,729
is not achieved on straight lines okay
so first point don't roll your patella

30
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:37,739
so first point don't roll your patella
 

31
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,250
so first point don't roll your patella
second point the distance that you think

32
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,260
second point the distance that you think
 

33
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,930
second point the distance that you think
you need to move

34
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:41,940
you need to move
 

35
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,709
you need to move
is not done on straight lines

36
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
is not done on straight lines
 

37
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,430
is not done on straight lines
if you CR if you generate the distance

38
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
if you CR if you generate the distance
 

39
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,110
if you CR if you generate the distance
in straight lines you're going to roll

40
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
in straight lines you're going to roll
 

41
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,670
in straight lines you're going to roll
your patella this is no way okay

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
your patella this is no way okay
 

43
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,630
your patella this is no way okay
um so you can you can rotate on your

44
00:00:59,630 --> 00:00:59,640
um so you can you can rotate on your
 

45
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,130
um so you can you can rotate on your
patella

46
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,140
patella
 

47
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,329
patella
you can't linearly go

48
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:04,339
you can't linearly go
 

49
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,830
you can't linearly go

as Naga is to start it rotating so you
 

59
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,929
as Naga is to start it rotating so you
should never Traverse across the mat

60
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:23,939

you rotated your patella you see that

72
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
you rotated your patella you see that
 

73
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,230
you rotated your patella you see that
and now it's scraping

and I would in shorts I'd be getting a

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,180
and I would in shorts I'd be getting a
 

77
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,569
and I would in shorts I'd be getting a
rope burn or a map burn okay but you

rope burn or a map burn okay but you
 

79
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,609
rope burn or a map burn okay but you
rolled your patellas

80
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:52,619
rolled your patellas
 

81
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,270

so what you can do instead is you bring

82
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,280
so what you can do instead is you bring
 

83
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,410
so what you can do instead is you bring
him over there and you can rotate on

patella down and you can rotate on that
 

91
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,130
patella down and you can rotate on that
other one
