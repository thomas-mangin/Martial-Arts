1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,110

so there's always levels to training so

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,120
so there's always levels to training so
 

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,749
so there's always levels to training so
maybe at first you kind of just learned

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
maybe at first you kind of just learned
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,150
maybe at first you kind of just learned
the hand pass

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
the hand pass
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,870
the hand pass
and the tsukiyashi

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
and the tsukiyashi
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,350
and the tsukiyashi
okay

10
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360

 

11
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,710

and you have to get that stuff but

12
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
and you have to get that stuff but
 

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,550
and you have to get that stuff but
if you stay there

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
if you stay there
 

15
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,150
if you stay there
then

16
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
then
 

17
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,510
then
that's not good

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
that's not good
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,910
that's not good
okay you only have one level that means

20
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
okay you only have one level that means
 

21
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,910
okay you only have one level that means
no levels okay

22
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
no levels okay
 

23
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,870
no levels okay
so

24
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
so
 

25
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,390
so
um

26
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
um
 

27
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,550
um
what i'm trying to do for those that

28
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
what i'm trying to do for those that
 

29
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,389
what i'm trying to do for those that
have done this for a while

30
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
have done this for a while
 

31
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,350
have done this for a while
is

32
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
is
 

33
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,750
is
right right from the start

34
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
right right from the start
 

35
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,709
right right from the start
you have that center connection uh so

36
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
you have that center connection uh so
 

37
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,310
you have that center connection uh so
you can see

38
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
you can see
 

39
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,190
you can see
you're already in the center okay

40
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
you're already in the center okay
 

41
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,389
you're already in the center okay
but i i'm yielding

42
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
but i i'm yielding
 

43
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,029
but i i'm yielding
as i'm doing it so at

44
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
as i'm doing it so at
 

45
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,189
as i'm doing it so at
any point you still have

46
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
any point you still have
 

47
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,830
any point you still have
that center connection okay i'm not

48
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
that center connection okay i'm not
 

49
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,590
that center connection okay i'm not
going like this

50
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600

 

51
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,349

so i don't come back this way and lose

52
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
so i don't come back this way and lose
 

53
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,430
so i don't come back this way and lose
that center connection and i'm just

54
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
that center connection and i'm just
 

55
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,509
that center connection and i'm just
doing the arm pass okay

56
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
doing the arm pass okay
 

57
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,750
doing the arm pass okay
so you're you're in that body

58
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
so you're you're in that body
 

59
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,350
so you're you're in that body
up to this point and then guess what

60
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
up to this point and then guess what
 

61
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,789
up to this point and then guess what
this arm is in that body too

62
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
this arm is in that body too
 

63
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,789
this arm is in that body too
okay

64
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
okay
 

65
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,630
okay
not here here

not here here
 

67
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,630
not here here
and you're just moving to the side of

68
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
and you're just moving to the side of
 

69
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,429
and you're just moving to the side of
that

so of course when you first start yes
 

75
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,270
so of course when you first start yes
just learn the arm pass and then just

76
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
just learn the arm pass and then just
 

77
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,910
just learn the arm pass and then just
learn to speak up that's gonna be fine

78
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
learn to speak up that's gonna be fine
 

79
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,789

okay

80
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
okay
 

81
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,510
okay
but advanced whole you want to feel his

82

but advanced whole you want to feel his
 

83
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,830
but advanced whole you want to feel his
body feeling his body

here if you see the same projection
 

91
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,149
here if you see the same projection
point

and same thing going all the way around
 

95
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,749
and same thing going all the way around
you still have that same projection

you still have that same projection
 

97
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,950
you still have that same projection
ability

98
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
ability
 

99

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
both arms are in his body and then
 

157
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,030
both arms are in his body and then
you're going to pass all control over to

158
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
you're going to pass all control over to
 

159
