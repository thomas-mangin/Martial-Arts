so you turn them right here into the

42
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,470
so you turn them right here into the
 

43
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,320
so you turn them right here into the
technique but this is structurally

how much of it before I hit on the line
 

59
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,690
how much of it before I hit on the line
okay so I pointed this way

60
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:57,700
okay so I pointed this way
 

61
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,390

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,530
line off the line and then I finally get
 

65
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,340
line off the line and then I finally get
back on whereas when I come in this way
