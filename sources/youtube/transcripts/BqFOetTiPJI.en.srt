project but
 

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,749

that's training to to advance

so he's going to
 

151
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,029
so he's going to
move around not one line you're going to

152

so he's his energy is being taken to the

254
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
so he's his energy is being taken to the
 

255
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,909
so he's his energy is being taken to the
ground

256
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
ground
 

257
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,390
ground
and now i have his center so i can move

258
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
and now i have his center so i can move
 

259
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,430
and now i have his center so i can move
his center

260
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
his center
 

261
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,550
his center
and i can project his center so

i'm going to have the ik adhesion i have
 

265
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,629
i'm going to have the ik adhesion i have
a cochlea projection

266
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
a cochlea projection
 

267
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,790
a cochlea projection
but he feels he feels the center so he

268
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
but he feels he feels the center so he
 

269
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,790

279
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,190
no i don't want to show first you can
see ikey adhesion

280
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
see ikey adhesion
 

281
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,070
see ikey adhesion
coking projection he doesn't want his

282
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
coking projection he doesn't want his
 

283
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,509
coking projection he doesn't want his
center manipulated

284
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
center manipulated
 

285
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,110
center manipulated
so he's going to try to free it and

286
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
so he's going to try to free it and

i'm a little tight here you see that
 

397
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,389
i'm a little tight here you see that
okay so uh

398
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
okay so uh
 

399
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,710
okay so uh
if i i get it but it's time you see the

400
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
if i i get it but it's time you see the
 

401
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,230

lag did you see the lag
 

403
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,550

okay so what i can do instead is bring

404
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
okay so what i can do instead is bring
 

405
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,230
okay so what i can do instead is bring
it to my shoulder and then there's no
