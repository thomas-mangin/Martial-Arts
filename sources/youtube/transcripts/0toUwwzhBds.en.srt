00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320

 

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,350

So when you're mounted concepts,

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
So when you're mounted concepts,
 

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,349
So when you're mounted concepts,
uh the first concept is just how to det

6
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
uh the first concept is just how to det
 

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,470
uh the first concept is just how to det
him. So he's got a four-point stance now

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
him. So he's got a four-point stance now
 

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,750
him. So he's got a four-point stance now
with between his hands and legs. Okay.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
with between his hands and legs. Okay.
 

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,150
with between his hands and legs. Okay.
So, we want to take away two legs of the

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
So, we want to take away two legs of the
 

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,390
So, we want to take away two legs of the
table and then take his balance that

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
table and then take his balance that
 

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,310
table and then take his balance that
way. So, we'll just start in this admin

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
way. So, we'll just start in this admin
 

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,389
way. So, we'll just start in this admin
mount here. And uh we're going to come

18
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
mount here. And uh we're going to come
 

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,750
mount here. And uh we're going to come
let's come under. So, we'll come under

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
let's come under. So, we'll come under
 

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,389
let's come under. So, we'll come under
two hands. Bump his hand with your

22
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
two hands. Bump his hand with your
 

23

Transition tricep and forearm. Trap the
 

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,510
Transition tricep and forearm. Trap the
same side leg. And then bridge his head

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
same side leg. And then bridge his head
 

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,670

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,590
come up and we'll already go right into
the um closed guard escapes. So check

34
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
the um closed guard escapes. So check
 

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:20,630
the um closed guard escapes. So check

00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
all right let's try okay again from the
 

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,870
all right let's try okay again from the
admin mount the variation is I'll come

40
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
admin mount the variation is I'll come
 

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,990
admin mount the variation is I'll come
through this time

42
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
through this time
 

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,590
through this time
and that over hook trap that arm. Trap

44
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
and that over hook trap that arm. Trap
 

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,390
and that over hook trap that arm. Trap
that same side leg for this one. Make

46
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
that same side leg for this one. Make
 

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,789
that same side leg for this one. Make
sure that you're going to turn your palm

48
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
sure that you're going to turn your palm
 

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,429
sure that you're going to turn your palm
up. Maybe even hug the guy's shoulder

50
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
up. Maybe even hug the guy's shoulder
 

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,390
up. Maybe even hug the guy's shoulder
just so you don't get your hand broken.

52
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
just so you don't get your hand broken.
 

53
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,190
just so you don't get your hand broken.
And then if necessary, you can use this

54
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
And then if necessary, you can use this
 

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,310
And then if necessary, you can use this
on the hip to push here. But you should

56
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
on the hip to push here. But you should
 

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,109
on the hip to push here. But you should
probably keep that guard hand up. I come

58
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
probably keep that guard hand up. I come
 

59
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,710
probably keep that guard hand up. I come
up.

60
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
up.
 

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,630
up.
I do the same thing. Come up out the

62
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
I do the same thing. Come up out the
 

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:10,710
I do the same thing. Come up out the
same way and into the force option.

64
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720

 

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,790

Okay, try me. This time we're going to

66
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay, try me. This time we're going to
 

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,070
Okay, try me. This time we're going to
have him just sitting up. Okay. And we

68
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
have him just sitting up. Okay. And we
 

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,630
have him just sitting up. Okay. And we
want to know how to get to that first

70
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
want to know how to get to that first
 

71
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,869
want to know how to get to that first
concept where he's got a hand on the

72
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
concept where he's got a hand on the
 

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,550
concept where he's got a hand on the
mat. Okay. That's the one we're going to

74
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
mat. Okay. That's the one we're going to
 

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,150
mat. Okay. That's the one we're going to
attack. So on this one, I'm gonna do

76
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
attack. So on this one, I'm gonna do
 

77
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,190
attack. So on this one, I'm gonna do
several things at once. I can grab up

78
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
several things at once. I can grab up
 

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,589
several things at once. I can grab up
and pull him so his hands get on the

80
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
and pull him so his hands get on the
 

81
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,750
and pull him so his hands get on the
mat. I'm going to knee bump him so his

82
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
mat. I'm going to knee bump him so his
 

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,229
mat. I'm going to knee bump him so his
hands get on the mat. And I'm going to

84
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
hands get on the mat. And I'm going to
 

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,430
hands get on the mat. And I'm going to
bridge so his hands get on the mat. So I

86
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
bridge so his hands get on the mat. So I
 

87
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,630
bridge so his hands get on the mat. So I
kind of do all that at once.

88
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
kind of do all that at once.
 

89
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,790
kind of do all that at once.
I'm going to push myself up with my

90
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm going to push myself up with my
 

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,470
I'm going to push myself up with my
legs.

92
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
legs.
 

93
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,630
legs.
I can go here

94
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
I can go here
 

95
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,430
I can go here
or here. Either one doesn't matter. And

96
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
or here. Either one doesn't matter. And
 

97
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,830
or here. Either one doesn't matter. And
then

98
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
then
 

99
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,309
then
the traps the same, the escapees the

100
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
the traps the same, the escapees the
 

101
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,910
the traps the same, the escapees the
same, and the force option is the same.

102
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
same, and the force option is the same.
 

103
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:11,830
same, and the force option is the same.
Saying it's seated up. Boom.

104
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840

 

105
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,390

All right, let's try. Really, for me, I

106
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
All right, let's try. Really, for me, I
 

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,830
All right, let's try. Really, for me, I
need to have my feet near my glutes, my

108
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
need to have my feet near my glutes, my
 

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,470
need to have my feet near my glutes, my
elbows anchored, kind of like I'm in

110
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
elbows anchored, kind of like I'm in
 

111
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,030
elbows anchored, kind of like I'm in
that boxing stance. My elbows will stop

112
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
that boxing stance. My elbows will stop
 

113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,070
that boxing stance. My elbows will stop
him from doing a high mount. Okay, but

114
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
him from doing a high mount. Okay, but
 

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,309
him from doing a high mount. Okay, but
sometimes it happens.

116
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
sometimes it happens.
 

117
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,550
sometimes it happens.
It's much harder. If I bridge here, I

118
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
It's much harder. If I bridge here, I
 

119
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,550
It's much harder. If I bridge here, I
won't affect him at all. I can't reach

120
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
won't affect him at all. I can't reach
 

121
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,190
won't affect him at all. I can't reach
it with my knee. So, we're just going to

122
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
it with my knee. So, we're just going to
 

123
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,589
it with my knee. So, we're just going to
push him down my stomach with my two

124
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
push him down my stomach with my two
 

125
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,949
push him down my stomach with my two
hands here. And now you're right back

126
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
hands here. And now you're right back
 

127
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,390
hands here. And now you're right back
where you start.

128
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400

 

129
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,270

Got the high mount. None of that works.

130
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
Got the high mount. None of that works.
 

131
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,509
Got the high mount. None of that works.
Take your two hands, push the center

132
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
Take your two hands, push the center
 

133
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,630
Take your two hands, push the center
down,

134
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640

 

135
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,110

you're out. Use that concept of

136
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
you're out. Use that concept of
 

137
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,429
you're out. Use that concept of
deposting the one hand, attacking both

138
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
deposting the one hand, attacking both
 

139
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,190
deposting the one hand, attacking both
sides of the table um

140
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
sides of the table um
 

141
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,070
sides of the table um
more broadly. Okay. So often times when

142
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
more broadly. Okay. So often times when
 

143
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,910
more broadly. Okay. So often times when
people are trying to secure their mouth,

144
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
people are trying to secure their mouth,
 

145
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,509
people are trying to secure their mouth,
they'll go ahead and hook on their on

146
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
they'll go ahead and hook on their on
 

147
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,189
they'll go ahead and hook on their on
your head. Okay? And you're like, I

148
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
your head. Okay? And you're like, I
 

149
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,469
your head. Okay? And you're like, I
can't get him off because he's hooking

150
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
can't get him off because he's hooking
 

151
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,590
can't get him off because he's hooking
on my head. But this arm is trapped. So

152
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
on my head. But this arm is trapped. So
 

153
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,230
on my head. But this arm is trapped. So
we're going to come around,

154
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
we're going to come around,
 

155
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,070
we're going to come around,
hug the side of my head, the back of my

156
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
hug the side of my head, the back of my
 

157
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,950
hug the side of my head, the back of my
head. I do the same thing. I can use

158
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
head. I do the same thing. I can use
 

159
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,830
head. I do the same thing. I can use
this other hand on his hip or his

160

257
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,029
this arm is not currently posting. So I

274
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
the force. So he's occupied his hand
 

275
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,749
the force. So he's occupied his hand
trying to control my Let's say he's

276
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
trying to control my Let's say he's
 

277
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,029

279
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,270
down. Okay. down and he's all based out
here. So, there's no point trying trying

280
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
here. So, there's no point trying trying
 

281
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,629
here. So, there's no point trying trying
it. Okay, I'm not going to be strong

282
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
it. Okay, I'm not going to be strong
 

283
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,110
it. Okay, I'm not going to be strong
enough here to get that. But, let's say

284
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
enough here to get that. But, let's say
 

285
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,230
enough here to get that. But, let's say
he goes up to uh try to punch. So, he's

286
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
he goes up to uh try to punch. So, he's
 

287
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,270
he goes up to uh try to punch. So, he's
going to go up to try to drive that

288
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
going to go up to try to drive that
 

289
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,270
going to go up to try to drive that
punch in. Okay. So, as he goes up again,

290
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
punch in. Okay. So, as he goes up again,
 

291
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,070
punch in. Okay. So, as he goes up again,
that hand is now not posting. Okay. So,

292
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
that hand is now not posting. Okay. So,
 

293
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,110
that hand is now not posting. Okay. So,
he's occupying the hand again. So, as he

294
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
he's occupying the hand again. So, as he
 

295
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,029
he's occupying the hand again. So, as he
goes up, he comes down. I pass it over

296
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
goes up, he comes down. I pass it over
 

297
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,670
goes up, he comes down. I pass it over
like this. And I'm going to do something

298
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
like this. And I'm going to do something
 

299
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,950
like this. And I'm going to do something
a little different now. Okay. I'm just

300
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
a little different now. Okay. I'm just
 

301
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,909
a little different now. Okay. I'm just
going to push in that way.

302
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
going to push in that way.
 

303
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,189
going to push in that way.
As he tries to come back,

304
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
As he tries to come back,
 

305
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,510
As he tries to come back,
that's where I can get it.

306
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520

 

307
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,589

And he's going up. He punches. I move it

308
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
And he's going up. He punches. I move it
 

309
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,469
And he's going up. He punches. I move it
over. Let him come around and I trap.

310
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
over. Let him come around and I trap.
 

311
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,469

313
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,869
And I'm on that side. Boom. Up and up.
So, there's any number of reasons why I

314
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
So, there's any number of reasons why I
 

315
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,029
So, there's any number of reasons why I
can get this arm on the other side. We

316
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
can get this arm on the other side. We
 

317
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,029
can get this arm on the other side. We
just had one example. He came to punch

318
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
just had one example. He came to punch
 

319
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,990
just had one example. He came to punch
and I moved it over.

320
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
and I moved it over.
 

321
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,750
and I moved it over.
And what I'm going to do is keep that

322
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
And what I'm going to do is keep that
 

323
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,870
And what I'm going to do is keep that
over there. So, there's a lot of

324
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
over there. So, there's a lot of
 

325
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,670
over there. So, there's a lot of
structural integrity here. I'll move

326
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
structural integrity here. I'll move
 

327
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,750
structural integrity here. I'll move
myself up and come up and start seeking

328
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
myself up and come up and start seeking
 

329
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,550
myself up and come up and start seeking
height. Don't give up. So, you Okay.

330
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560

structural integrity of my right hand on

336
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
structural integrity of my right hand on
 

337
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,389
structural integrity of my right hand on

you're trying not to have all this
stuff. He's going to try not to let me

404
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
stuff. He's going to try not to let me
 

405
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,030

again in his defense, the arm is
 

411
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,550
again in his defense, the arm is
deposed. Okay. So let's say he's even

412
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
deposed. Okay. So let's say he's even
 

413
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,910
deposed. Okay. So let's say he's even
low with weight on me. Okay. And same

414
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
low with weight on me. Okay. And same
 

415
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,910
low with weight on me. Okay. And same
thing, I'm going here. He defends and

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
thing, I'm going here. He defends and
 

417
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,110
thing, I'm going here. He defends and
I'm just going to keep it tight on him.

418
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm just going to keep it tight on him.
 

419
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm just going to keep it tight on him.
And I do the same thing. And I'm off and

420
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
And I do the same thing. And I'm off and
 

421
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,230

It doesn't matter which way he goes to

424
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
It doesn't matter which way he goes to
 

425
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,350
It doesn't matter which way he goes to
defend. I keep it off the ground. Boom.

426
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
defend. I keep it off the ground. Boom.
 

427
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,910
defend. I keep it off the ground. Boom.
Boom. And we're off and going.

428
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
Boom. And we're off and going.
 

429
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,269
Boom. And we're off and going.
So, just because you don't succeed,

430
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
So, just because you don't succeed,
 

431
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,630
So, just because you don't succeed,
he deeposted his hand. Okay. In one

432
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:52,640
he deeposted his hand. Okay. In one
 

433
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,670
he deeposted his hand. Okay. In one
case, I was able to grab it, but in

434
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
case, I was able to grab it, but in
 

435
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,269
case, I was able to grab it, but in
another case, let's say he's making

436
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
another case, let's say he's making
 

437
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,910
another case, let's say he's making
multiple circles. I'm just keeping it

438
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
multiple circles. I'm just keeping it
 

439
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,430
multiple circles. I'm just keeping it
off the ground. And in that time,

440
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
off the ground. And in that time,
 

441
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,910
off the ground. And in that time,
I'm prepping the foot and going.

442
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920

 

443
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,550

Okay. So, we'll do that one.

444
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560

 

445
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,430

So, in my attempt to get whatever and my

446
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
So, in my attempt to get whatever and my
 

447
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,110
So, in my attempt to get whatever and my
backup against his defense that I'm

448
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
backup against his defense that I'm
 

449
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,590
backup against his defense that I'm
trying to keep it off the mat, he's

450
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
trying to keep it off the mat, he's
 

451
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,990
trying to keep it off the mat, he's
trying to get it back on the mat. I can

452
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
trying to get it back on the mat. I can
 

453
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,790
trying to get it back on the mat. I can
start to take his balance. You see, even

454
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
start to take his balance. You see, even
 

455
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,150
start to take his balance. You see, even
as even though it's occupied. So, let's

456
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
as even though it's occupied. So, let's
 

457
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,590
as even though it's occupied. So, let's
say I'm taking his balance. He gets it

458
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
say I'm taking his balance. He gets it
 

459
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,629
say I'm taking his balance. He gets it
off and back on the mat. You see? Well,

460
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
off and back on the mat. You see? Well,
 

461
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,190
off and back on the mat. You see? Well,
it's back on the mat

462
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
it's back on the mat
 

463
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,110
it's back on the mat
and the knee gets light. If I can, I'll

464
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
and the knee gets light. If I can, I'll
 

465
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,069
and the knee gets light. If I can, I'll
go to the octopus.

466
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
go to the octopus.
 

467
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,870
go to the octopus.
If I can't, I go to elbow knee. Okay?

this stuff, there's that. And then I

558
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
this stuff, there's that. And then I
 

559
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,550
this stuff, there's that. And then I
have to use angle of deflection

560
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
have to use angle of deflection
 

561
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,829
have to use angle of deflection
with angle deviation. Same thing. Let's

562
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
with angle deviation. Same thing. Let's
 

563
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,150
with angle deviation. Same thing. Let's
say we're going here. He's tries for the

564
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
say we're going here. He's tries for the
 

565
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,389
say we're going here. He's tries for the

weight forward.
 

571
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,629
weight forward.
Then the arm that is pinned, which in

572
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
Then the arm that is pinned, which in
 

573
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,870
Then the arm that is pinned, which in
this case is the left arm, that's the

574
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
this case is the left arm, that's the
 

575
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,710
this case is the left arm, that's the
side I go out on. So he can't grab me as

576
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
side I go out on. So he can't grab me as
 

577
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,360
side I go out on. So he can't grab me as
I'm getting up.
