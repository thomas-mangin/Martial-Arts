390
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919

 

391
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,909

you would see

392
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
you would see
 

393
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,710
you would see
flying in my frame so i'll just give you

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
a little close up for anybody who hasn't
 

397
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,510
a little close up for anybody who hasn't
seen the books

398
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
seen the books
 

399
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,350
seen the books
okay

400
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
okay
 

401
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,070
okay
so

402
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080

 

403
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,070

what he hadn't realized at the time was

404
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
what he hadn't realized at the time was
 

405
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,189
what he hadn't realized at the time was
to make a book you put it in photographs

406
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
to make a book you put it in photographs
 

407
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,550
to make a book you put it in photographs
and you put in a small amount of words

408
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
and you put in a small amount of words
 

409
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,949
and you put in a small amount of words
and people were copying the books so

410
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
and people were copying the books so
 

411
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,870
and people were copying the books so
they would go from one

412
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
they would go from one
 

413
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,389
they would go from one
to perhaps another

414
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
to perhaps another
 

415
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,589
to perhaps another
angle

416
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599

 

417
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,310

and because the photos in the book was

418
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
and because the photos in the book was
 

419
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,430
and because the photos in the book was
cut from

420
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
cut from
 

421
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,070
cut from
the frames on the film

422
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
the frames on the film
 

423
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,030
the frames on the film
you might have one frame where sense is

424
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
you might have one frame where sense is
 

425
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,509
you might have one frame where sense is
doing the ski part

426
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
doing the ski part
 

427
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,070
doing the ski part
but the next frame might be five or ten

428
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
but the next frame might be five or ten
 

429
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,310
but the next frame might be five or ten
frames on

430
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
frames on
 

431
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,030
frames on
and

432
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
and
 

433
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,670
and
it might be a block but it doesn't show

434
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
it might be a block but it doesn't show
 

435
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,829
it might be a block but it doesn't show
you how he actually moved from the ski

436
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
you how he actually moved from the ski
 

437
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,509
you how he actually moved from the ski
to the block

438
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
to the block
 

439
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,670
to the block
and this is why people

440
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
and this is why people
 

441
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,949
and this is why people
got it so wrong

442
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
got it so wrong
 

443
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,990
got it so wrong
and he said that they they've

444
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
and he said that they they've
 

445
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,030
and he said that they they've
not destroyed the 31 carter but what

446
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
not destroyed the 31 carter but what
 

447
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,070
not destroyed the 31 carter but what
he's seeing he was horrified with

448
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080

 

449
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,430

so

450
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
so
 

451
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,670
so
i wouldn't normally

452
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
i wouldn't normally
 

453
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,310
i wouldn't normally
ever take on trying to explain

454
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
ever take on trying to explain
 

455
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,630
ever take on trying to explain
psychosenses books

456
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
psychosenses books
 

457
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,670
psychosenses books
because

458
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
because
 

459
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,949
because
to me

460
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
to me
 

461
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,590
to me
i will never ever reach if i lived a bit

462
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
i will never ever reach if i lived a bit
 

463
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,949
i will never ever reach if i lived a bit
150

464
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
150
 

465
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,509
150
would be nice i might reach his level

466
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
would be nice i might reach his level
 

467
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,389
would be nice i might reach his level
then

468
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
then
 

469
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,150
then
but he was so

470
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
but he was so
 

471
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,190
but he was so
knowledgeable

472
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200

 

473
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,150

but

474
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
but
 

475
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,790
but
my student said the books need

476
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
my student said the books need
 

477
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,230
my student said the books need
explaining

478
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
explaining
 

479
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,230
explaining
and so that's what i'm going to do so

480
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
and so that's what i'm going to do so
 

481
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,030
and so that's what i'm going to do so
this introductory is a bit long

482
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
this introductory is a bit long
 

483
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,509
this introductory is a bit long
but it's about

484
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
but it's about
 

485
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,630
but it's about
trying to

486
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
trying to
 

487
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,389
trying to
explain while making the films and how

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
instead of
 

493
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,550
instead of
frame by frame now with all this

494
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
frame by frame now with all this
