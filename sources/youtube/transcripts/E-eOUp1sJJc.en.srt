00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,630

so I think even in the patreon

4
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
so I think even in the patreon
 

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,549
so I think even in the patreon
group which is fine you're you are where

6
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:41,559
group which is fine you're you are where
 

7
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,150
group which is fine you're you are where
you are but of course here you are where

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
you are but of course here you are where
 

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,549
you are but of course here you are where
you

you
are and

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
are and
 

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
are and
um we're so used to in

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,130
um we're so used to in

iido understanding the techniques are

18
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:56,199
iido understanding the techniques are
 

19
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,189
iido understanding the techniques are
like mechanical sequences I just learned

20
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
like mechanical sequences I just learned
 

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,509
like mechanical sequences I just learned
the sequence

22
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:00,519
the sequence
 

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,910
the sequence
and I'm going to be good to

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
and I'm going to be good to
 

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,830
and I'm going to be good to
go of course that's all ego tripartite

26
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
go of course that's all ego tripartite
 

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,230
go of course that's all ego tripartite
mind right and so we're so used to

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
mind right and so we're so used to
 

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,870
mind right and so we're so used to
working with it we just think it's

30
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
working with it we just think it's
 

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,590
working with it we just think it's
mechanical it's sequential I learn the

32
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,600
mechanical it's sequential I learn the
 

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,950
mechanical it's sequential I learn the
moves and I go

34
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
moves and I go
 

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,670
moves and I go
okay

36
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
okay
 

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,230
okay
um but I would say no behind everything

38
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
um but I would say no behind everything
 

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,550
um but I would say no behind everything
I'm doing is an

40
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm doing is an
 

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm doing is an
internal aspect by which without you

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
internal aspect by which without you
 

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,390
internal aspect by which without you
can't do what I'm doing you can't in a

44
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
can't do what I'm doing you can't in a
 

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,109
can't do what I'm doing you can't in a
way what what I'm doing

46
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,119

 

47
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,270

externally is like

48
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
externally is like
 

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,469
externally is like
a it it's a technology to develop what

50
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
a it it's a technology to develop what
 

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,590
a it it's a technology to develop what
I'm doing internally okay but because

52
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm doing internally okay but because
 

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,149
I'm doing internally okay but because
you can't do what I'm doing externally

54
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
you can't do what I'm doing externally
 

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,510
you can't do what I'm doing externally
without doing what I'm doing

56
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
without doing what I'm doing
 

57
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,230
without doing what I'm doing
internally so for example we're doing

58
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
internally so for example we're doing
 

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,870
internally so for example we're doing
this technique and he comes around okay

60
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,880
this technique and he comes around okay
 

61
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,389
this technique and he comes around okay
and it looks okay I go down and then I

62
00:01:59,389 --> 00:01:59,399
and it looks okay I go down and then I
 

63
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,670
and it looks okay I go down and then I
go up oh stop him you see and if you

64
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
go up oh stop him you see and if you
 

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,190
go up oh stop him you see and if you
start paying

66
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,200
start paying
 

67
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,750
start paying
attention uh the angle here don't

68
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760

 

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,869

move is that an angle of incidence to

70
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
move is that an angle of incidence to
 

71
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,990
move is that an angle of incidence to
what he's doing so if you come around

72
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
what he's doing so if you come around
 

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,229
what he's doing so if you come around
camera go move where you can see it

74
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
camera go move where you can see it
 

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,670
camera go move where you can see it
okay and I'm basically on the top on the

76
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,680
okay and I'm basically on the top on the
 

77
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,270
okay and I'm basically on the top on the
front of his bone you feel that trist so

78
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,280
front of his bone you feel that trist so
 

79
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,470
front of his bone you feel that trist so
basically I'm just stopping that like

80
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,480
basically I'm just stopping that like
 

81
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,630
basically I'm just stopping that like
that you see that's a bracing angle

82
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
that you see that's a bracing angle
 

83
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,270
that you see that's a bracing angle
there

84
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,280
there
 

85
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,110
there
okay my Joe is not there my Joe is not

86
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,120
okay my Joe is not there my Joe is not
 

87
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,949
okay my Joe is not there my Joe is not
there my my Joe is

88
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
there my my Joe is
 

89
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,270
there my my Joe is
here you see

90
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
here you see
 

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,430
here you see
that okay so here's that bone where he

92
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
that okay so here's that bone where he
 

93
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,830
that okay so here's that bone where he
was where I was before do you see that

94
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
was where I was before do you see that
 

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,830
was where I was before do you see that
and now I'm here and this this will

96
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840
and now I'm here and this this will
 

97
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,750
and now I'm here and this this will
stick I can stop and of course if I

98
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
stick I can stop and of course if I
 

99
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,270
stick I can stop and of course if I
could stop I could Project without it

100
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
could stop I could Project without it
 

101
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,710
could stop I could Project without it
slipping

102
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:07,720
slipping
 

103
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,070
slipping
off without it having to be here you see

104
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
off without it having to be here you see
 

105
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,149
off without it having to be here you see
and just blocking

106
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
and just blocking
 

107
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,990
and just blocking
okay so I have to know how to make an

108
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,000
okay so I have to know how to make an
 

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,630
okay so I have to know how to make an
inate object stick in order to do that I

110
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,640
inate object stick in order to do that I
 

111
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,110
inate object stick in order to do that I
have to know how to make my my touch

112
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,120
have to know how to make my my touch
 

113
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,630
have to know how to make my my touch
stick you

114
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
stick you
 

115
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,309
stick you
see okay and if I can't stick I can't do

116
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
see okay and if I can't stick I can't do
 

117
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,070
see okay and if I can't stick I can't do
the move I got to change the

118
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
the move I got to change the
 

119
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,229
the move I got to change the
move

120
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
move
 

121
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,949
move
okay also as we're coming

122
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959

 

123
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,509

around when I go ahead and make that

124
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
around when I go ahead and make that
 

125
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,910
around when I go ahead and make that
stick I don't have to

126
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
stick I don't have to
 

127
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,949
stick I don't have to
stop okay I don't have to be on two

128
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
stop okay I don't have to be on two
 

129
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,069
stop okay I don't have to be on two
feet I don't have to have good

130
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:58,079

 

131
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,990

posture still stick

132
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000

 

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,789

if on the other

134
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
if on the other
 

135
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,229
if on the other
hand I have to have a stopping angle

136
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,239
hand I have to have a stopping angle
 

137
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,309
hand I have to have a stopping angle
here I probably have to have a bracing

138
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:11,319
here I probably have to have a bracing
 

139
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,750
here I probably have to have a bracing
angle on my feet and I got to

140
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760
angle on my feet and I got to
 

141
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,390
angle on my feet and I got to
stop get everything in place and then I

142
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
stop get everything in place and then I
 

143
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,509
stop get everything in place and then I
do a secondary move where I just push

144
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
do a secondary move where I just push
 

145
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,030
do a secondary move where I just push
him

146
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,040

 

147
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,350

away but if my move is internalized or

148
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,360
away but if my move is internalized or
 

149
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,790
away but if my move is internalized or
his I'm sorry his energy is internalized

150
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
his I'm sorry his energy is internalized
 

151
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,469
his I'm sorry his energy is internalized
and it's passing through me the same way

152
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
and it's passing through me the same way
 

153
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,870
and it's passing through me the same way
I don't need to have a good base you

154
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
I don't need to have a good base you
 

155
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,310
I don't need to have a good base you
can't push me over and likewise I can

156
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,320
can't push me over and likewise I can
 

157
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,270
can't push me over and likewise I can
project him without me falling I could

158
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,280
project him without me falling I could
 

159
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,390
project him without me falling I could
also move through that

160
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
also move through that
 

161
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,590
also move through that
energy so I don't have to

162
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
energy so I don't have to
 

163
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,070
energy so I don't have to
wait okay and I get some benefits from

164
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,080
wait okay and I get some benefits from
 

165
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,510
wait okay and I get some benefits from
that if he's doing the last

166
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520

 

167
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,310

move that's a lot of weight he's already

168
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,320
move that's a lot of weight he's already
 

169
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,469
move that's a lot of weight he's already
Sol and he's got a bracing angle you see

170
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:03,479
Sol and he's got a bracing angle you see
 

171
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,870
Sol and he's got a bracing angle you see
he goes

172
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
he goes
 

173
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,790
he goes
back he has

174
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:07,800
back he has
 

175
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,590
back he has
stance and he's coming around and boom

176
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
stance and he's coming around and boom
 

177
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,670
stance and he's coming around and boom
is when I hit him do you see when that

178
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
is when I hit him do you see when that
 

179
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,270
is when I hit him do you see when that
foot's in flight and it's not so good as

180
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
foot's in flight and it's not so good as
 

181
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,230
foot's in flight and it's not so good as
opposed to Foot In Front back foot in

182
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
opposed to Foot In Front back foot in
 

183
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,309
opposed to Foot In Front back foot in
back and weight shifted forward

184
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:26,319
back and weight shifted forward
 

185
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,590
back and weight shifted forward
okay so I'm doing the move

186
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
okay so I'm doing the move
 

187
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,430
okay so I'm doing the move
and I go and I keep

188
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
and I go and I keep
 

189
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,870
and I go and I keep
moving you can see he never gets onto

190
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
moving you can see he never gets onto
 

191
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,350
moving you can see he never gets onto
the front foot and

192
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
the front foot and
 

193
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,710
the front foot and
then it's much easier even mechanically

194
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:43,720
then it's much easier even mechanically
 

195
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,629
then it's much easier even mechanically
to just stop him mid step with the foot

196
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:47,639
to just stop him mid step with the foot
 

197
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,309
to just stop him mid step with the foot
in the back okay he goes and you stop

198
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,319
in the back okay he goes and you stop
 

199
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,230
in the back okay he goes and you stop
mid step you understand it's much easier

200
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
mid step you understand it's much easier
 

201
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,990
mid step you understand it's much easier
and he

202
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
and he
 

203
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,390
and he
goes and he's here and he's weighted

204
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
goes and he's here and he's weighted
 

205
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,469
goes and he's here and he's weighted
with that back foot that's

206
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
with that back foot that's
 

207
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,670
with that back foot that's
it's not that I can't project him I can

208
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
it's not that I can't project him I can
 

209
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,309
it's not that I can't project him I can
but it's much harder if I can't project

210
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
but it's much harder if I can't project
 

211
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,950
but it's much harder if I can't project
him to get in so

212
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
him to get in so
 

213
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,150
him to get in so
likewise that that that's a skill that I

214
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
likewise that that that's a skill that I
 

215
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,710
likewise that that that's a skill that I
that I have as I'm going

216
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
that I have as I'm going
 

217
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,430
that I have as I'm going
here I can be on one

218
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
here I can be on one
 

219
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,309
here I can be on one
leg because this energy is not really

220
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
leg because this energy is not really
 

221
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,670
leg because this energy is not really
stopping

222
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:24,680

223
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,550

me well I'm moving towards

224
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
me well I'm moving towards
 

225
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,550
me well I'm moving towards
him let me exaggerating that part for

226
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,560
him let me exaggerating that part for
 

227
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,070
him let me exaggerating that part for
you there's the little

228
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
you there's the little
 

229
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,550
you there's the little
stick okay and then

230
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:39,560
stick okay and then
 

231
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,550
stick okay and then
likewise even if he was in that last

232
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
likewise even if he was in that last
 

233
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,990
likewise even if he was in that last
stance you see you kind still take this

234
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
stance you see you kind still take this
 

235
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,870
stance you see you kind still take this
energy that he has and internalize it

236
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:51,880
energy that he has and internalize it
 

237
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,469
energy that he has and internalize it
and you can project even on the back

238
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:55,479
and you can project even on the back
 

239
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,510
and you can project even on the back
foot it's

240
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
foot it's
 

241
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,869
foot it's
doable okay that just makes it more

242
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:00,879
doable okay that just makes it more
 

243
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,270
doable okay that just makes it more
easier when he's he's not based and I'm

244
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
easier when he's he's not based and I'm
 

245
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,469
easier when he's he's not based and I'm
still going to project so as I come

246
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
still going to project so as I come
 

247
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,909
still going to project so as I come
around easy peasy okay so let's look at

248
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:14,919
around easy peasy okay so let's look at
 

249
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,749
around easy peasy okay so let's look at
some of the internal things that I have

250
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:18,759
some of the internal things that I have
 

251
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,990
some of the internal things that I have
one is I had an

252
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
one is I had an
 

253
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,309
one is I had an
adhesion

254
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
adhesion
 

255
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,589
adhesion
here this requires more

256
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
here this requires more
 

257
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,070
here this requires more
movement okay two

258
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
movement okay two
 

259
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,629
movement okay two
I'm moving at him when he's moving at me

260
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
I'm moving at him when he's moving at me
 

261
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,150
I'm moving at him when he's moving at me
without losing the

262
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
without losing the
 

263
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,749
without losing the
adhesion so that when I

264
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:36,759
adhesion so that when I
 

265
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,110
adhesion so that when I
project I'm projecting

266
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,120
project I'm projecting
 

267
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,909
project I'm projecting
that okay because I don't get pinned as

268
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
that okay because I don't get pinned as
 

269
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,869
that okay because I don't get pinned as
I'm walking forward do you you guys

aspect of him is not passing through me

292
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
aspect of him is not passing through me
 

293
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,510

it's not being internalized
 

295
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,469
it's not being internalized
okay so let's try

296
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
okay so let's try
 

297
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,790
okay so let's try
this let's focus in on the problem of

298
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
this let's focus in on the problem of
 

299
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,070
this let's focus in on the problem of
waiting okay don't wait

300
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
waiting okay don't wait
 

301
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,949
waiting okay don't wait
so he goes and I'm not going to wait for

302
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
so he goes and I'm not going to wait for
 

303
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,630
so he goes and I'm not going to wait for
him I'm moving

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
him I'm moving
 

305
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,750
him I'm moving
in right

306
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:38,760
in right
 

307
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,870
in right
away so first you move your left

308
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
away so first you move your left
 

309
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,750
away so first you move your left
foot in and the right foot goes and I

310
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:46,760

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,430
it's going to work but it doesn't it
doesn't work okay there's an interal

336
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,440
doesn't work okay there's an interal
 

337
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,190
doesn't work okay there's an interal
aspect and we can't do it so we take it

338
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,200
aspect and we can't do it so we take it
 

339
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,310
aspect and we can't do it so we take it
out and now the moves different from

340
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
out and now the moves different from
 

341
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,910
out and now the moves different from
what I did and the difference really is

342
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:48,920
what I did and the difference really is
 

343
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,790
what I did and the difference really is
between does it work or does it not work

344
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:51,800
between does it work or does it not work
 

345
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,630
between does it work or does it not work

483
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:17,150

here

484
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,160

 

485
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,629

okay right hey this one's not like

486
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:19,639
okay right hey this one's not like
 

487
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,790
okay right hey this one's not like
you're thinking now so H as I come in I

488
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:23,800
you're thinking now so H as I come in I
 

489
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,949
you're thinking now so H as I come in I
move off the line you see and I I create

490
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
move off the line you see and I I create
 

491
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,670
move off the line you see and I I create
that stal made

492
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
that stal made
 

493
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,590
that stal made
but it's the same ground Vector push he

494
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
but it's the same ground Vector push he
 

495
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,509
but it's the same ground Vector push he
tries to push down he's not going to do

496
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:36,519
tries to push down he's not going to do
 

497
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,910
tries to push down he's not going to do
it push it's not going to do it push

498
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:40,920
it push it's not going to do it push
 

499
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,629
it push it's not going to do it push
it's not going to do it so that's when I

500
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:43,639
it's not going to do it so that's when I
 

501
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,030
it's not going to do it so that's when I
go and I create that sailmate and I grab

502
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
go and I create that sailmate and I grab
 

503
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,790
go and I create that sailmate and I grab
