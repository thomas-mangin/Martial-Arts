00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,190
in then ba Center then get ready so you
 

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,369
in then ba Center then get ready so you
have to run sometimes you have to take

organization that doesn't let you
 

31
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,720
organization that doesn't let you
isolate the deltoid okay that's what

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:31,730
isolate the deltoid okay that's what
 

33
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,729
isolate the deltoid okay that's what
you're trying to find but if you keep

34
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:33,739
you're trying to find but if you keep
 

35
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,449
you're trying to find but if you keep
doing if you open too much you're gonna

36
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:37,459
doing if you open too much you're gonna
 

37
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,030
doing if you open too much you're gonna
have isolate the Internet's later okay

38
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,040
have isolate the Internet's later okay
 

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,069
have isolate the Internet's later okay
and same thing if you put your arm like

40
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:42,079
and same thing if you put your arm like
 

41
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,610
and same thing if you put your arm like
that if you let it get behind you

42
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:44,620
that if you let it get behind you
 

43
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,160
that if you let it get behind you
so if this dish stays pretty much where

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,170
so if this dish stays pretty much where
 

45
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:55,479
so if this dish stays pretty much where
it is is you open like that you should

46
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:55,489
it is is you open like that you should
 

47
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:24,120
it is is you open like that you should
have inserted come back around

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
clash so I changing her geometry
 

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,310
clash so I changing her geometry
I'm kidding on the other side of her

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm kidding on the other side of her
 

63

and I move my face and then I just drop
 

67
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,640
and I move my face and then I just drop
the way but that's the geometry of the

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:12,650
the way but that's the geometry of the
 

69
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,550
the way but that's the geometry of the
take down the geometry to take that is

70
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,560
take down the geometry to take that is
 

71
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,820
take down the geometry to take that is
not this

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:21,830

 

73
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,350

so I'm hittin position

74
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,360
so I'm hittin position
 

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,589
so I'm hittin position
then there's the opening and I'm going

76
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:27,599
then there's the opening and I'm going
 

77
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,010
then there's the opening and I'm going
to step in right and then I'll go over

78
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,020
to step in right and then I'll go over
 

79
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,100
to step in right and then I'll go over
my way that's what I'm doing was eating

a wool so if you look if you look I'm
 

83
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,200
a wool so if you look if you look I'm
not here I'm not shoving her down

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,210
not here I'm not shoving her down
 

85
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:52,359
not here I'm not shoving her down
backward oh then I move into that

86
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:52,369
backward oh then I move into that
 

87
00:05:52,369 --> 00:06:08,689
backward oh then I move into that
opening no this is more reason why our

88
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:08,699
opening no this is more reason why our
 

89
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,320
opening no this is more reason why our
mats

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,330
mats
 

91
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,339
mats
keep turning even if it turns if it

92
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:13,349
keep turning even if it turns if it
 

93
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:16,519
keep turning even if it turns if it
turns this way you're going to push on

94
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:16,529
turns this way you're going to push on
 

95
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,790
turns this way you're going to push on
him you have to keep turning the other

96
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:19,800
him you have to keep turning the other
 

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,360
him you have to keep turning the other
way so you should throw like this

98
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,370
way so you should throw like this
 

99
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,679
way so you should throw like this
some of you start out like you're going

100
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:27,689
some of you start out like you're going
 

101
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:52,480
some of you start out like you're going
to do it and then you go like that

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,490

 

103
00:06:52,490 --> 00:07:03,600

this way two hands

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,610

 

105

and watch your back foot hey don't let
your back good brother like that so you

108
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,200
your back good brother like that so you
 

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,550
your back good brother like that so you
come here yeah I have X amount of

110
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:27,560
come here yeah I have X amount of
 

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,850
come here yeah I have X amount of
penetration right and I move in this

112
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:30,860
penetration right and I move in this
 

113
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,090
penetration right and I move in this
back foot of the circle I started to get

114
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,100
back foot of the circle I started to get
 

115
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,450
back foot of the circle I started to get
disjointed you see that money

116
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,460
disjointed you see that money
 

117
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,200
disjointed you see that money
penetration angle that way but I'm

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,210
penetration angle that way but I'm
 

119
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,780
penetration angle that way but I'm
actually operating this way so make sure

120
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,790
actually operating this way so make sure
 

121
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:51,880
actually operating this way so make sure
you don't runner yourself and there's no

122
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:51,890
you don't runner yourself and there's no
 

123
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,520
you don't runner yourself and there's no
need in this technique to even pick up

124
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,530
need in this technique to even pick up
 

125
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,890
need in this technique to even pick up
that other foot you're shifting your

126
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:56,900
that other foot you're shifting your
 

127
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,800
that other foot you're shifting your
weight so that foot has to be stable

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:01,810
weight so that foot has to be stable
 

129
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,260
weight so that foot has to be stable
boom don't let this foot blood down

130
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,270

 

131
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,260

just boom and then you're shifting your

132
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,270
just boom and then you're shifting your
 

133
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:21,159
just boom and then you're shifting your
weight that back foot driving you into

134
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:21,169
weight that back foot driving you into
 

135
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:51,640
weight that back foot driving you into
the technique

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,650

 

137
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,460

have any anyone think that I bring my

138
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,470
have any anyone think that I bring my
 

139
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,960
have any anyone think that I bring my
arm like that he's gonna stop me okay

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,970
arm like that he's gonna stop me okay
 

141
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:18,309
arm like that he's gonna stop me okay
arm has to stay in front

142
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:18,319

 

143
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:21,799

so I'm gonna now I accentuate something

144
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:21,809
so I'm gonna now I accentuate something
 

145
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,299
so I'm gonna now I accentuate something
good okay

146
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:23,309
good okay
 

147
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:28,039
good okay
I'm not just doing a letting go why you

148
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,049
I'm not just doing a letting go why you
 

149
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:32,799
I'm not just doing a letting go why you
guys are so with my Senate contracts

150
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:32,809
guys are so with my Senate contracts
 

151
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,650
guys are so with my Senate contracts
you're bringing them into you okay so

152
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:36,660
you're bringing them into you okay so
 

153
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,960
you're bringing them into you okay so
when you go back go to Memphis like that

154
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:41,970
when you go back go to Memphis like that
 

155
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,039
when you go back go to Memphis like that
first part in the same way that we were

156
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,049
first part in the same way that we were
 

157
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:48,949
first part in the same way that we were
doing the street round in the same way

158
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
doing the street round in the same way
 

159
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,159
doing the street round in the same way
that we were doing that or you picked

160
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,169
that we were doing that or you picked
 

161
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,530
that we were doing that or you picked
them up right there doing the same thing

162
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,540
them up right there doing the same thing
 

163
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:03,889
them up right there doing the same thing
now with iheanyi it's going down so it

164
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:03,899
now with iheanyi it's going down so it
 

165
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,519
now with iheanyi it's going down so it
should be able to so you know when you

166

216
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:04,829
doesn't isolate the deltoid move you're
 

217
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,960
doesn't isolate the deltoid move you're
going to get this parry on the elbow you

218

going to get this parry on the elbow you
 

219
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:22,879
going to get this parry on the elbow you
don't have to move back as much right so

220
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:22,889
don't have to move back as much right so
 

221
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,400
don't have to move back as much right so
if you look at my footwork we'll do this

222
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,410
if you look at my footwork we'll do this
 

223
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,430
if you look at my footwork we'll do this
next time I'm out and I'm entering okay

224
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:30,440
next time I'm out and I'm entering okay
 

225
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,009
next time I'm out and I'm entering okay
triangle step this hand is doing the

226
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:34,019
triangle step this hand is doing the
 

227
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:40,280
triangle step this hand is doing the
parry boom but it's not just my arm my

228
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,290
parry boom but it's not just my arm my
 

229
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,639
parry boom but it's not just my arm my
spinner has to drop otherwise their arm

spinner has to drop otherwise their arm
 

231
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,530
spinner has to drop otherwise their arm
is just there you don't get my mic check

232
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:48,540
is just there you don't get my mic check
 

233
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,650
is just there you don't get my mic check
so the first move here boom is that

234
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:51,660
so the first move here boom is that
 

235

version you understand alright dive
 

243
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:30,500
version you understand alright dive
under so you see how you look what we're

244
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,510
under so you see how you look what we're
 

245
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,930
under so you see how you look what we're
making contact I'm going on do the right

see where I'm touching you
 

249
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:44,250
see where I'm touching you
okay I'm on top outside yeah and that's

250
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,260
okay I'm on top outside yeah and that's
 

251
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,470
okay I'm on top outside yeah and that's
push it all down got it okay don't be on

252
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,480
push it all down got it okay don't be on
 

253
00:14:49,480 --> 00:15:22,590
push it all down got it okay don't be on
the outside like that very quick it's

254
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:22,600
the outside like that very quick it's
 

255
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,150
the outside like that very quick it's
just trying to like structurally its

256
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
just trying to like structurally its
 

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,600
just trying to like structurally its
we're utilizing the technique okay but

258
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,610
we're utilizing the technique okay but
 

259
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,090
we're utilizing the technique okay but
if you look at my hands positioning

260
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,100
if you look at my hands positioning
 

261
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,240

right look my hand dropped right if I
 

263
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,819
right look my hand dropped right if I
did that on the punch I'm going to get

264
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:38,829
did that on the punch I'm going to get
 

265
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:47,970
did that on the punch I'm going to get
that but if you look here I'm trying to

266
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:47,980
that but if you look here I'm trying to
 

267
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:56,090
that but if you look here I'm trying to
keep that elbow so also my footwork was

268
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,100
keep that elbow so also my footwork was
 

269
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,360
keep that elbow so also my footwork was
more fading right we go to the strike

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,370
more fading right we go to the strike
 

271
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,310
more fading right we go to the strike
the footwork is lured forward so not

272
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:05,320
the footwork is lured forward so not
 

273
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,710
the footwork is lured forward so not
everything is exactly the same but

274
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:07,720
everything is exactly the same but
 

275
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,430
everything is exactly the same but
structurally it is okay

276
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,440
structurally it is okay
 

277
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,840
structurally it is okay
timing is obviously different right

278
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:12,850
timing is obviously different right
 

279
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,930
timing is obviously different right
between a ballistic and

280
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:14,940
between a ballistic and
 

281
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,910
between a ballistic and
obviously different so but in principle

282
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
obviously different so but in principle
 

283
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,300
obviously different so but in principle
the my is the same the space-time

284
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,310
the my is the same the space-time
 

285
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,580
the my is the same the space-time
harmony remains the same got it okay so

286
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,590
harmony remains the same got it okay so
 

287
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,130
harmony remains the same got it okay so
we had we have this correction right

288
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,140
we had we have this correction right
 

289
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,820
we had we have this correction right
