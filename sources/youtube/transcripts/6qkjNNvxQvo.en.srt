okay so this video will look at

4
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
okay so this video will look at
 

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,950
okay so this video will look at
seven older uh style sore prop practices

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
seven older uh style sore prop practices
 

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,990
seven older uh style sore prop practices
that maybe not seen so frequently uh go

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
that maybe not seen so frequently uh go
 

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,189
that maybe not seen so frequently uh go
through and

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
through and
 

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,830
through and
explain how they're done and demonstrate

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840

 

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,509

okay

14
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
okay
 

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,630
okay
this first uh practice is

16
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
this first uh practice is
 

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,110
this first uh practice is
pretty much what turned into the first

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
pretty much what turned into the first
 

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,630
pretty much what turned into the first
of what

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
of what
 

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,910
of what
uh so it's various ways of doing it

22
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
uh so it's various ways of doing it
 

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,990
uh so it's various ways of doing it
uh it was it was originally i think done

24
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
uh it was it was originally i think done
 

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,830
uh it was it was originally i think done
up very close striking to the head and

26
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
up very close striking to the head and
 

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,430
up very close striking to the head and
it moved to strike the head into the

28
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
it moved to strike the head into the
 

29
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,869
it moved to strike the head into the
hands and then

30
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
hands and then
 

31
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,790
hands and then
striking to the wrist and then sort of

32
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
striking to the wrist and then sort of
 

33
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,869
striking to the wrist and then sort of
striking so you're missing the wrist

34
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
striking so you're missing the wrist
 

35
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,790
striking so you're missing the wrist
so if you're looking at it from uh

36
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
so if you're looking at it from uh
 

37
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,910
so if you're looking at it from uh
sort of benefits uh practice to benefit

38
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
sort of benefits uh practice to benefit
 

39
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,110
sort of benefits uh practice to benefit
perspective you really

40
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
perspective you really
 

41
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,709
perspective you really
want to be doing a full strike you don't

42
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
want to be doing a full strike you don't
 

43
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,950
want to be doing a full strike you don't
want to be pulling it straight

44
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
want to be pulling it straight
 

45
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,870
want to be pulling it straight
uh so probably the most beneficial way

46
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
uh so probably the most beneficial way
 

47
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,670
uh so probably the most beneficial way
of practicing this

48
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
of practicing this
 

49
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,750
of practicing this
is just strike to clear the wrist and

50
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
is just strike to clear the wrist and
 

51
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,510
is just strike to clear the wrist and
then anything else is

52
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
then anything else is
 

53
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,030
then anything else is
to uh it's just an adjustment

54
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
to uh it's just an adjustment
 

55
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,749
to uh it's just an adjustment
uh i think if you train where you're

56
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
uh i think if you train where you're
 

57
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,590
uh i think if you train where you're
constantly stopping and strike halfway

58
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
constantly stopping and strike halfway
 

59
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,710
constantly stopping and strike halfway
through it's probably not

60
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
through it's probably not
 

61
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,630
through it's probably not
the best way of doing things but i'll

62
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
the best way of doing things but i'll
 

63
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,310
the best way of doing things but i'll
just show you striking the head

64
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
just show you striking the head
 

65
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,510
just show you striking the head
first and then we'll strike to to miss

66
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
first and then we'll strike to to miss
 

67
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,630
first and then we'll strike to to miss
the wrist so he

68
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
the wrist so he
 

69
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,749
the wrist so he
basically raises that follow-up

70
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
basically raises that follow-up
 

71
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,069
basically raises that follow-up
and he's straight to there

72
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
and he's straight to there
 

73
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,230
and he's straight to there
striking to miss the wrist

74

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
just talk through it first so
 

93
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,309

onto his wrist so he's exposing himself

so but he needs to then just move back

112
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
so but he needs to then just move back
 

113
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,869

out of the way
 

115
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,790
out of the way
and cover this position

116
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
and cover this position
 

117
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,550
and cover this position
so as i start this strike again you get

118
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
so as i start this strike again you get
 

119
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,470
so as i start this strike again you get
to cover it and i step forward and

to cover it and i step forward and
 

121
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,270
to cover it and i step forward and
strike the head

122
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
strike the head
 

123
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,030
strike the head
so i'm just starting the strike holding

124
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
so i'm just starting the strike holding
 

125
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,630
so i'm just starting the strike holding
back the posture and then

back the posture and then
 

127
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,910
back the posture and then
stepping it's a little bit tricky

gonna

266

gonna
 

267
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,790

controlling from the defending side you
 

273
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,070
controlling from the defending side you
can do it

274
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
can do it
 

275
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,950
can do it
in a more blending way at the end if he

276
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
in a more blending way at the end if he
 

277
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,790
in a more blending way at the end if he
steps back i prefer to have

278
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
steps back i prefer to have
 

279
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,230
steps back i prefer to have
the feel of the finish so he starts like

280
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
the feel of the finish so he starts like
 

281
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,070
the feel of the finish so he starts like
the further i say

282
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
the further i say
 

283
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,510
the further i say
goes for the strike yeah that's

284
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
goes for the strike yeah that's
 

285
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,029
goes for the strike yeah that's
important he does actually go for the

286
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
important he does actually go for the
 

287
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,469

strike not
 

289
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,110
strike not
just lifts and sort of becomes a passive

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
just lifts and sort of becomes a passive
 

291
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,110
just lifts and sort of becomes a passive
punch so he lifts the strike

292
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
punch so he lifts the strike
 

293
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,950
punch so he lifts the strike
he kind of gets an unpleasant jolting

he kind of gets an unpleasant jolting
 

295
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,430
