00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
it's not limp
 

183
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,469
it's not limp
like this and then you have to come from

184
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
like this and then you have to come from
 

185
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,310
like this and then you have to come from
a cold start into dynamics

186
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
a cold start into dynamics
 

187
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,270
a cold start into dynamics
so they power you up they motorize you

188
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280

 

189
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,070

this is what you want me on this feeling

190
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

191
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,990

now i'm going to talk about the elbow

192
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
now i'm going to talk about the elbow
 

193
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,310
now i'm going to talk about the elbow
you take it down there

194
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320

 

195
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,790

this one is very complex because it

196
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
this one is very complex because it
 

197
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,430
this one is very complex because it
looks like this

198
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440

 

199
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,310

a step behind

200
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
a step behind
 

201
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,870
a step behind
a straightening of the front leg

202
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
a straightening of the front leg
 

203
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,189
a straightening of the front leg
the turning of the hips

204
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
the turning of the hips
 

205
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,510
the turning of the hips
the turning of the torso

206
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
the turning of the torso
 

207
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,830
the turning of the torso
and you only put your hands out

208
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
and you only put your hands out
 

209
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,590
and you only put your hands out
for no other reason

210
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
for no other reason
 

211
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,670
for no other reason
than to save you getting kicked in the

212
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
than to save you getting kicked in the
 

213
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,430
than to save you getting kicked in the
face and this is why you look the other

214
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
face and this is why you look the other
 

215
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,790
face and this is why you look the other
way

216
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
way
 

217
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,029
way
no other reason the arms do not

218
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
no other reason the arms do not
 

219
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,590
no other reason the arms do not
absolutely nothing everybody thinks that

220
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
absolutely nothing everybody thinks that
 

221
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,350
absolutely nothing everybody thinks that
they they have to

222
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
they they have to
 

223
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,310
they they have to
throw

224
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
throw
 

225
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,430
throw
the person with their arms you don't

226
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
the person with their arms you don't
 

227
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,710
the person with their arms you don't
you should be able to do this straighten

228
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
you should be able to do this straighten
 

229
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,150
you should be able to do this straighten
the leg turn the hips torso and if this

230
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
the leg turn the hips torso and if this
 

231
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,670
the leg turn the hips torso and if this
is all correct this leg is all correct

232
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
is all correct this leg is all correct
 

233
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,710
is all correct this leg is all correct
they will just fall over

234
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
they will just fall over
 

235
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,990
they will just fall over
over that

236
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
over that
 

237
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,029
over that
leg you don't need to do anything with

238
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
leg you don't need to do anything with
 

239
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,790
leg you don't need to do anything with
the arms if you can do that then you

240
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
the arms if you can do that then you
 

241
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,510
the arms if you can do that then you
know

242
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
know
 

243
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,510
know
you're doing it without

244
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
you're doing it without
 

245
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,990
you're doing it without
the strength of your upper body

246
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000

 

247
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,670

now here's a contradiction

248
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680

 

249
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,150

it looks like

250
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

251
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,790

i'm coming into them

252
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800

 

253
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,950

into them

254
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
into them
 

255
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,270
into them
turning my hips

256
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
turning my hips
 

257
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,070
turning my hips
stepping behind them

258
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
stepping behind them
 

259
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,790
stepping behind them
straighten the front leg turn

260
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
straighten the front leg turn
 

261
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,670
straighten the front leg turn
the

262
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
the
 

263
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,590
the
the hips the upper body comes out

264
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
the hips the upper body comes out
 

265
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,590
the hips the upper body comes out
he's not the foot my turn

266
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
he's not the foot my turn
 

267
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,189
he's not the foot my turn
it may not

268
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199

 

269
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,110

sometimes we

270
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
sometimes we
 

271
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,870
sometimes we
we offer it here

272
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
we offer it here
 

273
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,670
we offer it here
and they just take it

274
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
and they just take it
 

275
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,070
and they just take it
there but this is the basic

276
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
there but this is the basic
 

277
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,029
there but this is the basic
take down

278
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039

 

279
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,510

elbow now

280
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
elbow now
 

281
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,469
elbow now
same

282
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
same
 

283
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,790
same
as the tana anchor has a little

284
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
as the tana anchor has a little
 

285
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,469
as the tana anchor has a little
subtleness of going off at two o'clock

286
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479

 

287
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,469

remembering the turner hanger i said you

288
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
remembering the turner hanger i said you
 

289
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:20,150
remembering the turner hanger i said you
can move the feet

290
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160

 

291
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,309

you can move

292
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
you can move
 

293
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,710
you can move
the feed if you wish

294
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720

 

295
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,950

okay

296
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960

 

297
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,589

or you don't need to move the feet

298
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
or you don't need to move the feet
 

299
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,629
or you don't need to move the feet
okay

300
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
okay
 

301
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,950
okay
each time you do it will be have a

302
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
each time you do it will be have a
 

303
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,710
each time you do it will be have a
different result

304
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
different result
 

305
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,189
different result
it will be depending on where you are

306
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
it will be depending on where you are
 

307
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,510
it will be depending on where you are
you can't say exactly every time with

308
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
you can't say exactly every time with
 

309
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,070
you can't say exactly every time with
each person you're going to do repeat

310
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
each person you're going to do repeat
 

311
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,869
each person you're going to do repeat
the same we're trying to repeat the same

312
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
the same we're trying to repeat the same
 

313
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,029
the same we're trying to repeat the same
but sometimes there'll be a little foot

314
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
but sometimes there'll be a little foot
 

315
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,550
but sometimes there'll be a little foot
need moving or or something will need

316
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
need moving or or something will need
 

317
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,150
need moving or or something will need
just adding

318
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
just adding
 

319
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,469
just adding
to make you comfortable it's not so much

320
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
to make you comfortable it's not so much
 

321
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,749
to make you comfortable it's not so much
the technique you need to be natural and

322
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
the technique you need to be natural and
 

323
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,950
the technique you need to be natural and
comfortable

324
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
comfortable
 

325
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,430
comfortable
you don't want to go too far outside the

326
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
you don't want to go too far outside the
 

327
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,150
you don't want to go too far outside the
parameters of the technique by being

328
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
parameters of the technique by being
 

329
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,270
parameters of the technique by being
yourself you do need to also look for

330
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
yourself you do need to also look for
 

331
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,390
yourself you do need to also look for
what works for you

332
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400

 

333
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,270

this is a complete contradiction now to

334
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
this is a complete contradiction now to
 

335
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,510
this is a complete contradiction now to
what you think is going on

336
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
what you think is going on
 

337
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,070
what you think is going on
remember about the yoga

338
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
remember about the yoga
 

339
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,550
remember about the yoga
so they take you down

340
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560

 

341
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,269

my arm now

342
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
my arm now
 

343
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,709
my arm now
is as if they were holding a bokken but

344
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
is as if they were holding a bokken but
 

345
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,430
is as if they were holding a bokken but
upside down so if you can watch the

346
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
upside down so if you can watch the
 

347
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,990
upside down so if you can watch the
curve the balkan would be that way up

348
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
curve the balkan would be that way up
 

349
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,670
curve the balkan would be that way up
normally wouldn't it

350
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
normally wouldn't it
 

351
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,829
normally wouldn't it
they were holding it

352
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
they were holding it
 

353
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,990
they were holding it
and i'm turning it so i've turned the

354
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
and i'm turning it so i've turned the
 

355
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,949
and i'm turning it so i've turned the
bottom over

356
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
bottom over
 

357
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,230
bottom over

00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
since you used to show this with a
 

361
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,310
since you used to show this with a
bottom you used to push it and say you

362
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
bottom you used to push it and say you
 

363
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,150
bottom you used to push it and say you
can't go this way

364
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
can't go this way
 

365
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,590
can't go this way
because it's

366
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
because it's
 

367
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,590
because it's
you know their strength

368
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
you know their strength
 

369
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,829

but he used it with one finger get the

but he used it with one finger get the
 

371
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,070
but he used it with one finger get the
bokken and go that way

372
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
bokken and go that way
 

373
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,829
bokken and go that way
that way i'm going to show you from this

374
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
that way i'm going to show you from this
 

375
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,470
that way i'm going to show you from this
angle so since he would get

376
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
angle so since he would get
 

377
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,430
angle so since he would get
the bokken and he would push it and show

378
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
the bokken and he would push it and show
 

379
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,230
the bokken and he would push it and show
you how strong the person would hold it

380
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
you how strong the person would hold it
 

381
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,389
you how strong the person would hold it
and he would get the tip of the bokken

382
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
and he would get the tip of the bokken
 

383
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,110
and he would get the tip of the bokken
and he would go this way

384
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
and he would go this way
 

385
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,670
and he would go this way
it's at right angles

386
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
it's at right angles
 

387
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,310
it's at right angles
and he would then hold it and tip them

388
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
and he would then hold it and tip them
 

389
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,550
and he would then hold it and tip them
over and throw them down

390
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
over and throw them down
 

391
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,310
over and throw them down
so with right angles

392
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320

this and once this is broken
then you can power in

562
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
