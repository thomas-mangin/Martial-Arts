1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,910

so same non-cons non-contest station

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
so same non-cons non-contest station
 

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,749
so same non-cons non-contest station
same yield

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
same yield
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,430
same yield
see the circle

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
see the circle
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,470
see the circle
see the circle

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480

 

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,390

and then step into this circle we're

10
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
and then step into this circle we're
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,150
and then step into this circle we're
going to step into the circle but then

12
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
going to step into the circle but then
 

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,230
going to step into the circle but then
i'm going to come back

14
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
i'm going to come back
 

15
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,150
i'm going to come back
and show it

16
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160

 

17
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,189

i'm going to attack that thought

18
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
i'm going to attack that thought
 

19
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,429
i'm going to attack that thought
with my db so

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
with my db so
 

21
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,710
with my db so
it will be

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
it will be
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,549
it will be
a displacing

24
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559

 

25
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,869

i'm not tripping him i'm not putting my

26
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
i'm not tripping him i'm not putting my
 

27
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,030
i'm not tripping him i'm not putting my
foot behind his foot and then throwing

28
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
foot behind his foot and then throwing
 

29
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,030
foot behind his foot and then throwing
him down

30
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
him down
 

31
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,190
him down
i'm going through his base through his

32
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
i'm going through his base through his
 

33
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,910
i'm going through his base through his
face here boom

34
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920

 

35
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,470

but you can do it easy so beginners just

36
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
but you can do it easy so beginners just
 

37
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,069
but you can do it easy so beginners just
practice your fall he's just going to

38
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
practice your fall he's just going to
 

39
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:04,950
practice your fall he's just going to
practice

40
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960

 

41
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,190

you can still do the yield part here

42
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200

 

43
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,630

yield heart circle and then he practices

44
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640

 

45
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,390

a little more advanced don't take their

46
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
a little more advanced don't take their
 

47
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,830
a little more advanced don't take their
leg out but enter

48
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840

 

49
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,990

but you do not have to push back like

50
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
but you do not have to push back like
 

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,950
but you do not have to push back like
this on them you can't push into the

52
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
this on them you can't push into the
 

53
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,590
this on them you can't push into the
circle so you know over here i enter and

54
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
circle so you know over here i enter and
 

55
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,830
circle so you know over here i enter and
i push into the circle

56
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840

 

57
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,069

so the yield push into the circle

58
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079

 

59
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,910

and then once you get going then you

60
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
and then once you get going then you
 

61
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,350
and then once you get going then you
will take the leg

62
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360

 

63
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,429

so a yield

64
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
so a yield
 

65
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,109
so a yield
take out

66
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
take out
 

67
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,510
take out
a yield point

68
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
a yield point
 

69
00:01:49,520 --> 00:02:02,469
a yield point
he just hits boy here boy

70
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479

 

71
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,030

okay so three levels of training

72
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040

 

73
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,280

default to the level of skill of your uk
