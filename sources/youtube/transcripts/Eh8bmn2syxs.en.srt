81
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,670
>> You feel the the press down. You see
what it does to him. Okay, but I'm just

82
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
what it does to him. Okay, but I'm just
 

83
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,710
what it does to him. Okay, but I'm just
standing here normal. Okay. It's no It's

84
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
standing here normal. Okay. It's no It's

when you punch. I don't have to go here.
 

89
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,550
when you punch. I don't have to go here.
The the yong will drop and he'll feel

90
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
The the yong will drop and he'll feel
 

91
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,670
The the yong will drop and he'll feel
like

92
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680

 

93
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,550

feel like that you felt heavier. You

94
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
feel like that you felt heavier. You
 

95
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,229
feel like that you felt heavier. You
felt like you wound up more. You see,

96
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
felt like you wound up more. You see,
 

97
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,190
felt like you wound up more. You see,
I'm just now putting it 3 4 feet away

98
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm just now putting it 3 4 feet away
 

99
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,150
I'm just now putting it 3 4 feet away
from my body. But inside my body,

100
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
from my body. But inside my body,
 

101
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,589
from my body. But inside my body,
everything relaxes. Okay? And then that

102
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
everything relaxes. Okay? And then that
 

103
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,390
everything relaxes. Okay? And then that
force that's dropping down

104
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
force that's dropping down
 

105
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,270
force that's dropping down
drops everything down. Okay?

106
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
drops everything down. Okay?
 

107
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,910
drops everything down. Okay?
When we give you this task,

108
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920

 

109
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,150

if I give you just the tush, that's

110
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
if I give you just the tush, that's
 

111
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,390
if I give you just the tush, that's
where we start seeing

112
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
where we start seeing
 

113
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,229
where we start seeing
that.

114
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
that.
 

115
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,830
that.
Now, I give you the quick transition

116
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
Now, I give you the quick transition
 

117
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,830
Now, I give you the quick transition
and we're not seeing the drop anymore.

118
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
and we're not seeing the drop anymore.
 

119
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,229
and we're not seeing the drop anymore.
Okay. Try it again. You got to get both.

120
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
Okay. Try it again. You got to get both.
 

121
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,470
Okay. Try it again. You got to get both.
So

122
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
So
 

123
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,990
So
the

124
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
the
 

125
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,110
the
the more I push down, let's say there is

126
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
the more I push down, let's say there is
 

127
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,149
the more I push down, let's say there is
weight of this on his feet of X, a value

128
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
weight of this on his feet of X, a value
 

129
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,470
weight of this on his feet of X, a value
of X. You got it?

130
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
of X. You got it?
 

131
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,589
of X. You got it?
>> When he tries to lift up, it's now X

132
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
>> When he tries to lift up, it's now X
 

133
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,270
>> When he tries to lift up, it's now X
plus Y because he's opposing the energy.

134
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
plus Y because he's opposing the energy.
 

135
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,589
plus Y because he's opposing the energy.
It will increase as an opposing energy.

136
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
It will increase as an opposing energy.
 

137
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,550
It will increase as an opposing energy.
you'll increase the pressure the value

138
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
you'll increase the pressure the value
 

139
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,949
you'll increase the pressure the value
at contact. You get that?

140
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
at contact. You get that?
 

141
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,869
at contact. You get that?
>> This is why

142
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
>> This is why
 

143
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,830
>> This is why
as I've said many times in the energy

144
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
as I've said many times in the energy
 

145
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,710
as I've said many times in the energy
when you're doing the energetics

146
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
when you're doing the energetics
 

147
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,270
when you're doing the energetics
when they resist the technique should

148
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
when they resist the technique should
 

149
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,229
when they resist the technique should
get easier because the adhesion value

150
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
get easier because the adhesion value
 

151
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,470
get easier because the adhesion value
went up the co value went up. Okay. If

152
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
went up the co value went up. Okay. If
 

153
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,470
went up the co value went up. Okay. If
you don't have the energetics then the

154
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
you don't have the energetics then the
 

155
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,309
you don't have the energetics then the
weapon he'll be able to overpower the

156
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
weapon he'll be able to overpower the
 

157
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,869
weapon he'll be able to overpower the
weapon. You see that? So for example in

158
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
weapon. You see that? So for example in
 

159
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,190
weapon. You see that? So for example in
those seated kokidosa

160
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
those seated kokidosa
 

161
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,789
those seated kokidosa
somebody who does not understand how to

162
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
somebody who does not understand how to
 

163
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,710
somebody who does not understand how to
use the qua right will get overridden do

164
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
use the qua right will get overridden do
 

165
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,710
use the qua right will get overridden do
it to your friends back home. Okay do

166
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
it to your friends back home. Okay do
 

167
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,310
it to your friends back home. Okay do
the spinal displacement and you'll see

168
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
the spinal displacement and you'll see
 

169
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,469
the spinal displacement and you'll see
what will happen. Okay but somebody who

170
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
what will happen. Okay but somebody who
 

171
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,390
what will happen. Okay but somebody who
does understand it you just made

172
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
does understand it you just made
 

173
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,550
does understand it you just made
yourself more projectable because the

174
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
yourself more projectable because the
 

175
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,230
yourself more projectable because the
energy value that they're working with

176
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
energy value that they're working with
 

177
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,590
energy value that they're working with
is now higher. Inversely,

178
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
is now higher. Inversely,
 

179
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,070
is now higher. Inversely,
on the first day, before you were used

180
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
on the first day, before you were used
 

181
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,390
on the first day, before you were used
to getting projected, we had to reel in

182
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
to getting projected, we had to reel in
 

183
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,150
to getting projected, we had to reel in
the yin the yin yield, remember? And

184
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
the yin the yin yield, remember? And
 

185
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,310
the yin the yin yield, remember? And
what was happening was the energy value

186
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
what was happening was the energy value
 

187
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,629
what was happening was the energy value
was dropping, which is why you did it.

188
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
was dropping, which is why you did it.
 

189
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,270
was dropping, which is why you did it.
You make yourself less. Okay? So, here

190
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280

 

191
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,030

you don't want your hands

192
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
you don't want your hands
 

193
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,830
you don't want your hands
because your hands your like

194
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
because your hands your like
 

195
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,510
because your hands your like
mathematically. Yes. X goes up. But this

196
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
mathematically. Yes. X goes up. But this
 

197
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,350
mathematically. Yes. X goes up. But this
isn't this isn't math. This is

198
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
isn't this isn't math. This is
 

199
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,550
isn't this isn't math. This is
metacarpals to get it on wood. Do do you

200
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
metacarpals to get it on wood. Do do you
 

201
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,590
metacarpals to get it on wood. Do do you
understand? So whatever I I hit that

202
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
understand? So whatever I I hit that
 

203
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,710
understand? So whatever I I hit that
with boom. I I hit it now harder because

204
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
with boom. I I hit it now harder because
 

205
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,270
with boom. I I hit it now harder because
he's going up.

206
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
he's going up.
 

207
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,510
he's going up.
So marially I would pin him more. I

208
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
So marially I would pin him more. I
 

209
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,230
So marially I would pin him more. I
break his hands more. And I guaranteed

210
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
break his hands more. And I guaranteed
 

211
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,629
break his hands more. And I guaranteed
more of the ski because he got pinned

212
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
more of the ski because he got pinned
 

213
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,790
more of the ski because he got pinned
more. Okay.

214
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
more. Okay.
 

215
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,270
more. Okay.
What you'll see what he's doing is

216
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
What you'll see what he's doing is
 

217
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,070
What you'll see what he's doing is
there's ever so slightly a yielding to

218
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
there's ever so slightly a yielding to
 

219
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,150
there's ever so slightly a yielding to
the pressure.

220
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
the pressure.
 

221
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,029
the pressure.
You see, he is trying to absorb the

222
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
You see, he is trying to absorb the
 

223
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,950
You see, he is trying to absorb the
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So,

224
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So,
 

225
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,590
energy, not fight the energy. Okay? So,
when I'm coming in,

226
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
when I'm coming in,
 

227
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,670
when I'm coming in,
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go

228
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go
 

229
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,870
I can I feel the impact and I feel it go
because he's decreasing the value at

230
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
because he's decreasing the value at
 

231
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,270
because he's decreasing the value at
contact. Do you understand that? I won't

232
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
contact. Do you understand that? I won't
 

233
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,710
contact. Do you understand that? I won't
do it hard, but hold it up and you

234
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
do it hard, but hold it up and you
 

235
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,629
do it hard, but hold it up and you
you'll see tension go into the shoulders

236
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
you'll see tension go into the shoulders
 

237
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,189
you'll see tension go into the shoulders
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the

238
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the
 

239
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,710
and it pulls and it hurt it hurts the
hand.

240
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
hand.
 

241
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:13,670
hand.
Okay. But

242
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680

 

243
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,550

>> but it doesn't make my weapon go up.

244
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
>> but it doesn't make my weapon go up.
 

245
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,270
>> but it doesn't make my weapon go up.
Make sense? Okay. So, two things.

246
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
Make sense? Okay. So, two things.
 

247
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,790
Make sense? Okay. So, two things.
You

248
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
You
 

249
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,230
You
don't let his resistance stop you. You

250
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
don't let his resistance stop you. You
 

251
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,950
don't let his resistance stop you. You
let it feed you. That was y it gets

252
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
let it feed you. That was y it gets
 

253
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,110
let it feed you. That was y it gets
internalized.

254
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
internalized.
 

255
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,350
internalized.
And then

256
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
And then
 

257
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,070
And then
absorb the energy.

258
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
absorb the energy.
 

259
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,909
absorb the energy.
Okay? So that we're not breaking hands

260
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
Okay? So that we're not breaking hands
 

261
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,400
Okay? So that we're not breaking hands
here. Make sense? Okay. Try again.
