big problem it's a big confusing thing

8
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:09,179
big problem it's a big confusing thing
 

9
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,150
big problem it's a big confusing thing
right now for everyone I think the way

10
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,160
right now for everyone I think the way
 

11
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
right now for everyone I think the way
that I explain IQ is really

12
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:12,450
that I explain IQ is really
 

13
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,669
that I explain IQ is really
straightforward we'll make a lot of

14
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
straightforward we'll make a lot of
 

15
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,480
straightforward we'll make a lot of
sense to people

16
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,490
sense to people
 

17
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,740
sense to people
I think if you use it kind of as a

18
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:15,750
I think if you use it kind of as a
 

19
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,150
I think if you use it kind of as a
barometer it'll help you figure out

20
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160
barometer it'll help you figure out
 

21
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,460
barometer it'll help you figure out
what's going on with Aikido so the first

22
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,470
what's going on with Aikido so the first
 

23
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,890
what's going on with Aikido so the first
thing to understand is that Aikido is a

24
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:21,900
thing to understand is that Aikido is a
 

25
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,529

system a system is not just a random

26
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:24,539
system a system is not just a random
 

27
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,509
system a system is not just a random
collection of techniques it's an

28
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:26,519
collection of techniques it's an
 

29
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,120
collection of techniques it's an
organization of things so if you have a

30
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,130
organization of things so if you have a
 

31
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,880
organization of things so if you have a
problem there's another suggested answer

32
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:31,890
problem there's another suggested answer
 

33
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,229
problem there's another suggested answer
to the problem and as you go through

34
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
to the problem and as you go through
 

35
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,360
to the problem and as you go through
this as you go through the system you

36
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,370
this as you go through the system you
 

37
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,340
this as you go through the system you
constantly are getting answers to new

38
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,350
constantly are getting answers to new
 

39
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,380
constantly are getting answers to new
problems that are arising as you go so a

40
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,390
problems that are arising as you go so a
 

41
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,850
problems that are arising as you go so a
system is not just a random collection

42
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:40,860
system is not just a random collection
 

43
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,549
system is not just a random collection
of things it's it's an attempt to get us

44
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
of things it's it's an attempt to get us
 

45
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,250
of things it's it's an attempt to get us
to a resolution of some sort the next

46
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,260
to a resolution of some sort the next
 

47
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,540
to a resolution of some sort the next
thing you have to understand is what's a

48
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:47,550
thing you have to understand is what's a
 

49
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,450
thing you have to understand is what's a
resolution in Aikido so Aikido is not

50
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,460
resolution in Aikido so Aikido is not
 

51
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,040
resolution in Aikido so Aikido is not
about fighting I think you could ask any

52
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,050

Aikido instructor in the world and they

54
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:53,850
Aikido instructor in the world and they
 

55
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,069
Aikido instructor in the world and they
would say oh yeah I can it was not about

56
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
would say oh yeah I can it was not about
 

57
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,139
would say oh yeah I can it was not about
fighting but what does that mean and how

58
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:57,149
fighting but what does that mean and how
 

59
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,910
fighting but what does that mean and how
can something be a martial art when it's

60
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
can something be a martial art when it's
 

61
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,400
can something be a martial art when it's
not about fighting so we all know the

62
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,410
not about fighting so we all know the
 

63
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,009
not about fighting so we all know the
you fight or flight' when conflict

64
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:04,019
you fight or flight' when conflict
 

65
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,359
you fight or flight' when conflict
arises right so there's a conflict you

66
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
arises right so there's a conflict you
 

67
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,920
arises right so there's a conflict you
either choose to fight or flight'

68
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:06,930
either choose to fight or flight'
 

69
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,539
either choose to fight or flight'
there's another part of this which is

70
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:08,549
there's another part of this which is
 

71
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,910
there's another part of this which is
negotiate and that's not really talked

72
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:10,920
negotiate and that's not really talked
 

73
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,230
negotiate and that's not really talked
about in most martial art systems

74
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
about in most martial art systems
 

75
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,450
about in most martial art systems
however the idea of negotiation is the

76
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460

Aikido success is having a conversation
with someone so if we can get it back to

150
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,830
with someone so if we can get it back to
 

151
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,840
with someone so if we can get it back to
a state where we're having a

152
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:36,850
a state where we're having a
 

153
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,090

conversation that's what we ideally want
 

155
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,010
conversation that's what we ideally want
to do there's several ways we can do

156
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,020
to do there's several ways we can do
 

157
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
to do there's several ways we can do
that but remember in IQ no we don't want

158
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,030
that but remember in IQ no we don't want
 

159
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,700
that but remember in IQ no we don't want
to fight we want to negotiate

160

so the problem arises when he won't let
 

163
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,110
so the problem arises when he won't let
me have the conversation with him right

164
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
me have the conversation with him right
 

165
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,670
me have the conversation with him right
so if I'm sitting you're dealing with

166
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,680
so if I'm sitting you're dealing with
 

167
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,650
so if I'm sitting you're dealing with
this guy and he won't let me have a

168
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:52,660
this guy and he won't let me have a
 

169
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,820
this guy and he won't let me have a
conversation with him

170
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:53,830
conversation with him
 

171
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,530
conversation with him
then I've got to defend myself in some

172
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:55,540
then I've got to defend myself in some
 

173
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,120
then I've got to defend myself in some
way I've got to keep myself from being

174
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,130
way I've got to keep myself from being
 

175
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,430
way I've got to keep myself from being
hurt now that doesn't mean hurting him

176
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
hurt now that doesn't mean hurting him
 

177
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,070
hurt now that doesn't mean hurting him
right so I don't suspect you he doesn't

178
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
right so I don't suspect you he doesn't
 

179
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,720
right so I don't suspect you he doesn't
like me and then deck him now I could

180
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730
like me and then deck him now I could
 

181
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,130
like me and then deck him now I could
and that would be an answering boxing

182
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,140
and that would be an answering boxing
 

183
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,230
and that would be an answering boxing
hands or if I want to hold him down

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,580
hands or if I want to hold him down
that would be an answer that wrestling

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:08,590
that would be an answer that wrestling
 

187
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,830
that would be an answer that wrestling

art and IQ no I simply want to have that
 

191
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,000
art and IQ no I simply want to have that
conversation so what he's gonna try to

192
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,010
conversation so what he's gonna try to
 

193
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,880
conversation so what he's gonna try to
do is get me in some way right he can

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:17,890
do is get me in some way right he can
 

195
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,510
do is get me in some way right he can
punch me he can hit me he can he could

196
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:21,520
punch me he can hit me he can he could
 

197
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,820

grab me ready to do any of this stuff to

198
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:23,830
grab me ready to do any of this stuff to
 

199
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,990
grab me ready to do any of this stuff to
me all this stuff would be bad we

200
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
me all this stuff would be bad we
 

201
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,160
me all this stuff would be bad we
couldn't have a conversation when he

202
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,170
couldn't have a conversation when he
 

203
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,010
couldn't have a conversation when he
does that because we're in physical he's

204
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,020
does that because we're in physical he's
 

205
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,390
does that because we're in physical he's
got me physically so I can't do anything

206
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
got me physically so I can't do anything
 

207
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,520
got me physically so I can't do anything
so what I want to do is always keep a

208
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,530
so what I want to do is always keep a
 

209
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,400
so what I want to do is always keep a
minimum safety distance so our minimum

210
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,410
minimum safety distance so our minimum
 

211
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,890
minimum safety distance so our minimum
safety distance is this from this

212
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:37,900
safety distance is this from this
 

213
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,100
safety distance is this from this
position he cannot touch me without

214
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,110
position he cannot touch me without
 

215
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,650
position he cannot touch me without
taking a step so maybe he get surprised

216
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:43,660
taking a step so maybe he get surprised
 

217
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,810
taking a step so maybe he get surprised
me and hit me can't surprise me and kick

218
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:45,820
me and hit me can't surprise me and kick
 

219
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,280
me and hit me can't surprise me and kick
me a lot of the actually tough stuff

220
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,290
me a lot of the actually tough stuff
 

221
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,290
me a lot of the actually tough stuff
like oh you have to get really good hand

222
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,300
like oh you have to get really good hand
 

223
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,880
like oh you have to get really good hand
deflections well the first step before

224
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:50,890
deflections well the first step before
 

225
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,680
deflections well the first step before
really good hand deflections is you have

226
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,690
really good hand deflections is you have
 

227
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,930
really good hand deflections is you have
to get good distance and good mine so

228
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:54,940
to get good distance and good mine so
 

229
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,699
to get good distance and good mine so
I'm gonna have good space between me and

230
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:56,709
I'm gonna have good space between me and
 

231
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,320
I'm gonna have good space between me and
this guy if I have good space then he

232
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,330
this guy if I have good space then he
 

233
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,479
this guy if I have good space then he
cannot surprise me now ideally what

234
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:00,489
cannot surprise me now ideally what
 

235
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,520
cannot surprise me now ideally what
would happen is every time he takes a

236
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,530
would happen is every time he takes a
 

237
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,010
would happen is every time he takes a
step towards me I take a counter step

238
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,020
step towards me I take a counter step
 

239
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,140
step towards me I take a counter step
all right now a lot of people say like

240
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,150
all right now a lot of people say like
 

241
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,000
all right now a lot of people say like
how practical is something like this

242
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,010
how practical is something like this
 

243
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,010
how practical is something like this
it's highly practical in fact it's the

244
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,020
it's highly practical in fact it's the
 

245
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,470
it's highly practical in fact it's the
basic skill then you use all the time

246
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,480
basic skill then you use all the time
 

247
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,750
basic skill then you use all the time
right if someone wants to attack you you

248
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
right if someone wants to attack you you
 

249
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,060
right if someone wants to attack you you
probably don't just go raw or shooter

250
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,070
probably don't just go raw or shooter
 

251
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,479
probably don't just go raw or shooter
double-leg you say

252
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:19,489
double-leg you say
 

253
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,460
double-leg you say
man calm down everything's cool let's

254
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,470
man calm down everything's cool let's
 

255
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,740
man calm down everything's cool let's
not have a fight right that is ideally

256
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:23,750
not have a fight right that is ideally
 

257
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,210
not have a fight right that is ideally
what you want to do and that's exactly

what Aikido prescribes as well now Ike

260
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
what Aikido prescribes as well now Ike
 

261
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,950
what Aikido prescribes as well now Ike
you know if the system continues on if

262
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
you know if the system continues on if
 

263
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,710
you know if the system continues on if
he gives us a problem at this range so

264
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
he gives us a problem at this range so
 

265
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,020
he gives us a problem at this range so
remember Ike use a system meaning every

266
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,030
remember Ike use a system meaning every
 

267
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,670
remember Ike use a system meaning every
time we have a new problem we have a new

268
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
time we have a new problem we have a new
 

269
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,260
time we have a new problem we have a new
set of answers as we go so you can make

270
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,270
set of answers as we go so you can make
 

271
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,969
set of answers as we go so you can make
a little flowchart that explains this

272
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:39,979
a little flowchart that explains this
 

273
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,249
a little flowchart that explains this
right so the next problem would come in

274
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:42,259
right so the next problem would come in
 

275
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,529
right so the next problem would come in
when he starts to break this distance

276
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:44,539
when he starts to break this distance
 

277
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,809
when he starts to break this distance
down so remember ideally I'm trying to

278
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:46,819
down so remember ideally I'm trying to
 

279
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,570
down so remember ideally I'm trying to
keep this minimum safety distance every

280
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:49,580
keep this minimum safety distance every
 

281
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,290
keep this minimum safety distance every
time he takes a step I take a step the

282
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,300
time he takes a step I take a step the
 

283
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,629
time he takes a step I take a step the
next stage is what if he's able to break

284
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
next stage is what if he's able to break
 

285
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,899
next stage is what if he's able to break
that distancing okay so with our system

286
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:58,909
that distancing okay so with our system
 

287
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,240
that distancing okay so with our system
the the main idea is we want to have a

288
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,250
the the main idea is we want to have a
 

289
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,460
the the main idea is we want to have a
conversation so success in guy Aikido

290
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:03,470
conversation so success in guy Aikido
 

291
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,600
conversation so success in guy Aikido
number one goal is to have a

292
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:04,610
number one goal is to have a
 

293
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,760
number one goal is to have a
conversation a non physical interaction

294
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:06,770
conversation a non physical interaction
 

295
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,300
conversation a non physical interaction
what if he threatens to attack me in

296
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,310
what if he threatens to attack me in
 

297
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,770
what if he threatens to attack me in
this so what having a conversation and I

298
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:11,780
this so what having a conversation and I
 

299
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,820
this so what having a conversation and I
know he's up to something

300
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:12,830
know he's up to something
 

301
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,040
know he's up to something
I want to keep and set this minimum

302
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,050
I want to keep and set this minimum
 

303
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,809
I want to keep and set this minimum
safety distance so that's my goal every

304
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:16,819
safety distance so that's my goal every
 

305
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,879
safety distance so that's my goal every
time he tries to encroach on this

306
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:18,889
time he tries to encroach on this
 

307
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,499
time he tries to encroach on this
minimum safety distance I'm gonna take a

308
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:20,509
minimum safety distance I'm gonna take a
 

309
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,480
minimum safety distance I'm gonna take a
counter step that keeps us at this

310
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,490
counter step that keeps us at this
 

311
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,430
counter step that keeps us at this
minimum safety distance that enables me

312
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,440
minimum safety distance that enables me
 

313
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,439
minimum safety distance that enables me
to keep him from surprising me at all

314
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:26,449
to keep him from surprising me at all
 

315
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,540
to keep him from surprising me at all
which is what I want now how would he

316
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,550
which is what I want now how would he
 

317
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,430
which is what I want now how would he
break that down well what he would

318
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,440
break that down well what he would
 

319
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,529
break that down well what he would
probably do is try and rush in past that

320
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:32,539
probably do is try and rush in past that
 

321
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,080
probably do is try and rush in past that
right so understand that every time he

322
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,090
right so understand that every time he
 

323
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,300
right so understand that every time he
takes a normal step in I'm taking a

324
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,310
takes a normal step in I'm taking a
 

325
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,370
takes a normal step in I'm taking a
counter step right so if he's just

326
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,380
counter step right so if he's just
 

327
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,110
counter step right so if he's just
stepping in normally I'm also stepping

328
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
stepping in normally I'm also stepping
 

329
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,029
stepping in normally I'm also stepping
out normally he can't get any closer to

330
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
out normally he can't get any closer to
 

331
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,070
out normally he can't get any closer to
me so in order to get closer to me he's

332
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
me so in order to get closer to me he's
 

333
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,709
me so in order to get closer to me he's
going to have to lunge in right so this

334
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:47,719
going to have to lunge in right so this
 

335
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,260
going to have to lunge in right so this
lunge in is what I chose next set of

336
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,270
lunge in is what I chose next set of
 

337
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,300
lunge in is what I chose next set of
answers are so the next set of answers

338
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:52,310
answers are so the next set of answers
 

339
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,749
answers are so the next set of answers
are armed suppression and taiyo kinko so

340
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
are armed suppression and taiyo kinko so
 

341
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,850
are armed suppression and taiyo kinko so
tyno HECO is a position change right so

342
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:57,860
tyno HECO is a position change right so
 

343
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,890
tyno HECO is a position change right so
imagine he was coming on a straight line

344
00:05:59,890 --> 00:05:59,900
imagine he was coming on a straight line
 

345
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,409
imagine he was coming on a straight line
to me I want to change my position so

346
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:02,419
to me I want to change my position so
 

347
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,629
to me I want to change my position so
he'll miss me really simple along with

348
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
he'll miss me really simple along with
 

349
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,959
he'll miss me really simple along with
that we're gonna get hand suppression

350
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:06,969
that we're gonna get hand suppression
 

351
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,300
that we're gonna get hand suppression
okay so now we've got our main idea I

352
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,310
okay so now we've got our main idea I
 

353
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,740
okay so now we've got our main idea I
wanna have a conversation with Josh

354
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750
wanna have a conversation with Josh
 

355
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,270
wanna have a conversation with Josh
number two what if he's trying to

356
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
number two what if he's trying to
 

357
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,980
number two what if he's trying to
encroach on me I want to set that

358
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:14,990
encroach on me I want to set that
 

359
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,510
encroach on me I want to set that
minimum safety distance and keep the

360
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:16,520
minimum safety distance and keep the
 

361
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,499
minimum safety distance and keep the
minimum safety distance

362
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:17,509
minimum safety distance
 

363
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,480
minimum safety distance
how will he break that down he's gonna

364
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,490
how will he break that down he's gonna
 

365
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,309
how will he break that down he's gonna
rush in in some way to break it down

366
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:21,319
rush in in some way to break it down
 

367
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,050
rush in in some way to break it down
when he does that I want to make tyno

368
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,060
when he does that I want to make tyno
 

369
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,070
when he does that I want to make tyno
Hanko so he comes in I get off line now

370
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,080
Hanko so he comes in I get off line now
 

371
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Hanko so he comes in I get off line now
the next important thing to understand

372
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,370
the next important thing to understand
 

373
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,930
the next important thing to understand
is I need

374
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:28,940
is I need
 

375
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,880
is I need
some kind of hand suppression but don't

376
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:30,890
some kind of hand suppression but don't
 

377
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,620
some kind of hand suppression but don't
suppress his hand even if I move off the

378
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:32,630
suppress his hand even if I move off the
 

379
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,820
suppress his hand even if I move off the
side he's just gonna shoot his hands

380
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:33,830
side he's just gonna shoot his hands
 

381
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,740
side he's just gonna shoot his hands
over here and grab me I don't want him

382
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:35,750
over here and grab me I don't want him
 

383
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,300
over here and grab me I don't want him
to be able to control me remember if he

384
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,310
to be able to control me remember if he
 

385
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,770
to be able to control me remember if he
controls me that it's gonna be really

386
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:38,780
controls me that it's gonna be really
 

387
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,630
controls me that it's gonna be really
difficult to have that conversation that

388
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:40,640
difficult to have that conversation that
 

389
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,730
difficult to have that conversation that
we're angling towards so what I do is I

390
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:42,740
we're angling towards so what I do is I
 

391
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,530
we're angling towards so what I do is I
get some kind of arm suppression here

392
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:44,540
get some kind of arm suppression here
 

393
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,240
get some kind of arm suppression here
now what this does it keeps it makes it

394
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,250
now what this does it keeps it makes it
 

395
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,650
now what this does it keeps it makes it
very difficult for this arm to come in

396
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:47,660
very difficult for this arm to come in
 

397
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,870
very difficult for this arm to come in
and get me right so he can move his arm

398
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:49,880
and get me right so he can move his arm
 

399
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,610
and get me right so he can move his arm
of course and I can move my arm I can

400
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:51,620
of course and I can move my arm I can
 

401
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,040
of course and I can move my arm I can
keep him at bay which is what I want he

402
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,050
keep him at bay which is what I want he
 

403
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,420
keep him at bay which is what I want he
could also reach across from his other

404
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,430
could also reach across from his other
 

405
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,460
could also reach across from his other
arm and I can use one side to stop the

406
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,470
arm and I can use one side to stop the
 

407
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,890
arm and I can use one side to stop the
other side this basic idea is where we

408
00:06:59,890 --> 00:06:59,900
other side this basic idea is where we
 

409
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,230
other side this basic idea is where we
get the concept of eeky eeky Ozai

410
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
get the concept of eeky eeky Ozai
 

411
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,150
get the concept of eeky eeky Ozai
keido's first main principle and that is

412
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
keido's first main principle and that is
 

413
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,830
keido's first main principle and that is
to control at the elbow

414
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
to control at the elbow
 

415
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,720
to control at the elbow
now why elbow control so good is because

416
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:07,730
now why elbow control so good is because
 

417
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,880
now why elbow control so good is because
if I'm off here at the hand he can move

418
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:09,890
if I'm off here at the hand he can move
 

419
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,470
if I'm off here at the hand he can move
his hand really fast and it's hard for

420
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:11,480
his hand really fast and it's hard for
 

421
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,970
his hand really fast and it's hard for
me to keep up with it so if it goes high

422
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:12,980
me to keep up with it so if it goes high
 

423
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,680
me to keep up with it so if it goes high
it's hard for me to chase it up high if

424
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:14,690
it's hard for me to chase it up high if
 

425
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,240
it's hard for me to chase it up high if
it goes low hard for me to chase it low

426
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,250
it goes low hard for me to chase it low
 

427
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,700
it goes low hard for me to chase it low
if I control Josh at the shoulder he

428
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,710
if I control Josh at the shoulder he
 

429
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,740
if I control Josh at the shoulder he
still has a lot of mobility so it's hard

430
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:20,750
still has a lot of mobility so it's hard
 

431
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,640
still has a lot of mobility so it's hard
for me to stop him

432
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:21,650
for me to stop him
 

433
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,620
for me to stop him
however the elbow is a nice medium place

434
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,630
however the elbow is a nice medium place
 

435
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,360
however the elbow is a nice medium place
where if his arm goes down I can go down

436
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,370
where if his arm goes down I can go down
 

437
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,310
where if his arm goes down I can go down
arm goes up I can go up I can keep a

438
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,320
arm goes up I can go up I can keep a
 

439
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,380
arm goes up I can go up I can keep a
hold of him also if he tries too hard to

440
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,390
hold of him also if he tries too hard to
 

441
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,200
hold of him also if he tries too hard to
go up I get what is a true proper ego

442
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,210
go up I get what is a true proper ego
 

443
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,970
go up I get what is a true proper ego
which is a way to throw him away from me

444
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:33,980
which is a way to throw him away from me
 

445
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,780
which is a way to throw him away from me
which is what I want

which is what I want
 

447
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,750
which is what I want
so remember he's now thrown himself in

448
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:37,760
so remember he's now thrown himself in
 

449
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,850
so remember he's now thrown himself in
here to break the distance I've made ty

450
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:39,860
here to break the distance I've made ty
 

451
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,400
here to break the distance I've made ty
no hanko so I've made a variation in

452
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,410
no hanko so I've made a variation in
 

453
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,230
no hanko so I've made a variation in
position so that way I'm safe and I'm

454
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
position so that way I'm safe and I'm
 

455

getting some kind of arm suppression to

456
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,130
getting some kind of arm suppression to
 

457
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,500
getting some kind of arm suppression to
keep him from getting me so this arm

458
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,510
keep him from getting me so this arm
 

459
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,810
keep him from getting me so this arm
suppresses what he helps me to be able

460
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:49,820
suppresses what he helps me to be able
 

461
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,790
suppresses what he helps me to be able
to escape here now what if it breaks

462
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:51,800
to escape here now what if it breaks
 

463
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,490
to escape here now what if it breaks
down from this okay so remember our

464
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:54,500
down from this okay so remember our
 

465
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,800
down from this okay so remember our

intense and I might need to use a weapon

950
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:52,779
intense and I might need to use a weapon
 

951
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,170
intense and I might need to use a weapon
so this is where me using weapon comes

952
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:55,180
so this is where me using weapon comes
 

953
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,730
so this is where me using weapon comes
into play and he might be grabbing my

954
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:56,740
into play and he might be grabbing my
 

955
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,350
into play and he might be grabbing my
wrist to keep me from using the weapon

956
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,360
wrist to keep me from using the weapon
 

957
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,570
wrist to keep me from using the weapon
but what if him and his buddy are armed

958
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,580
but what if him and his buddy are armed
 

959
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,340
but what if him and his buddy are armed
it's important to understand I get as a

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:30,339
very practical weapons for the day and
 

981
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,760
very practical weapons for the day and
today one of most of the lessons we

982
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:32,770
today one of most of the lessons we
 

983
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,100
today one of most of the lessons we
learn with those weapons we can apply so

984
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,110
learn with those weapons we can apply so
 

985
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,590
learn with those weapons we can apply so
if they're using a weapon then we need

986
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
if they're using a weapon then we need
 

987
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,150
if they're using a weapon then we need
to learn how to disarm the weapon and

988
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,160
to learn how to disarm the weapon and
 

989
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
to learn how to disarm the weapon and
this is where a lot of the Aikido

990
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:40,570
this is where a lot of the Aikido
 

991
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,600
this is where a lot of the Aikido
techniques come from so remember the

992
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,610

996
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,370
to them so in most martial arts we think
 

997
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,829
to them so in most martial arts we think
oh how do I get the person so when you

distance down and they get arms
oppression I'm

1030
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,270
oppression I'm
 

1031
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,980
oppression I'm
to disarm all right so now remember my

1032

might end up in a position kind of like
 

1039
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,650
might end up in a position kind of like
this right a lot of people will say yeah

1040
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:37,660
this right a lot of people will say yeah
 

1041
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,720
this right a lot of people will say yeah
but IQ teaches you to strip the weapon

1042
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:39,730
but IQ teaches you to strip the weapon
 

1043
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,220
but IQ teaches you to strip the weapon
away from some position like this first

away from some position like this first
 

1045
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,450

of all I'm not just gonna stay like this

1046
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,460
of all I'm not just gonna stay like this
 

1047
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,700
of all I'm not just gonna stay like this
I would begin to start to grab a hold of

1048
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,710
I would begin to start to grab a hold of
 

1049
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,470
I would begin to start to grab a hold of
this guy so I could get the arm the

1050
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
this guy so I could get the arm the
 

1051
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,360
this guy so I could get the arm the
weapon away if I needed to but what if

1052
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,370
weapon away if I needed to but what if
 

1053
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,730
weapon away if I needed to but what if
he pulls back remember if he pulls back

1054
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:50,740
he pulls back remember if he pulls back
 

1055
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,460
he pulls back remember if he pulls back
what I want is distance again so that's

1056
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,470
what I want is distance again so that's
 

1057
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,320
what I want is distance again so that's
fine if he's pulling the weapon back I

1058
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,330
fine if he's pulling the weapon back I
 

1059
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,630
fine if he's pulling the weapon back I
want to pull myself back as well so we

1060
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,640
want to pull myself back as well so we
 

1061
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,919
want to pull myself back as well so we
again get out of distance

1062
00:17:58,919 --> 00:17:58,929
again get out of distance
 

1063
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,049
again get out of distance
I'm always manipulating that distance so

1064
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:01,059
I'm always manipulating that distance so
 

1065
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,210
I'm always manipulating that distance so
there is space between us this only

1066
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,220
there is space between us this only
 

1067
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,669
there is space between us this only
happens because he is pushing into it so

1068
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
happens because he is pushing into it so
 

1069
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,950
happens because he is pushing into it so
hard and I'm not able to back out so if

1070
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:07,960
hard and I'm not able to back out so if
 

1071
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,080
hard and I'm not able to back out so if
he pulls himself out that's fine I'll

1072
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,090
he pulls himself out that's fine I'll
 

1073
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,910
he pulls himself out that's fine I'll
pull myself out as well exactly what I

1074
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:11,920
pull myself out as well exactly what I
 

1075
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,250
pull myself out as well exactly what I
want if we're in this close distance

1076
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,260
want if we're in this close distance
 

1077
