the respiratory Meridian you can find
out by identifying where the flo ribs

246
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,240
out by identifying where the flo ribs
 

247
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,350
out by identifying where the flo ribs
are so they're not up here the the

248
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,360
are so they're not up here the the

that's why that's there and then he
 

317
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,110
that's why that's there and then he
starts to counter that I just build the

318

he's going to have another frame right
 

361
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,790
he's going to have another frame right
there so I go around that frame I'm

362

body and you have a gift R here so you
have an arm isolation Okay let's work on

448
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
have an arm isolation Okay let's work on
 

449
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,269
have an arm isolation Okay let's work on
that arm first and as long as you fall

450
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
that arm first and as long as you fall
 

451
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,550
that arm first and as long as you fall
into the in space that arm will will be

452
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,560
into the in space that arm will will be
 

453
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,430
into the in space that arm will will be
there for you if you're tense and you

454
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,440
there for you if you're tense and you
 

455
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,030
there for you if you're tense and you
push you're going to have a delay the

456
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
push you're going to have a delay the
 

457
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,269
push you're going to have a delay the
arm won't be there okay try to use so we

458
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
arm won't be there okay try to use so we
 

459
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,990
arm won't be there okay try to use so we
already we already saw like at at speed

460
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
already we already saw like at at speed
 

461
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,590
already we already saw like at at speed
of life that this thing is on and it's

462
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
of life that this thing is on and it's
 

463
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,430
of life that this thing is on and it's
it's done okay um but as I said if you

464
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440
it's done okay um but as I said if you
 

465
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,870
it's done okay um but as I said if you
like push and force things it's going to

466
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
like push and force things it's going to
 

467
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,230
like push and force things it's going to
cause a Time gap which will amount to a

468
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
cause a Time gap which will amount to a
 

469
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,829
cause a Time gap which will amount to a
a space Gap Okay so when he goes

470
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
a space Gap Okay so when he goes
 

471
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,189
a space Gap Okay so when he goes
out he can see how he pulled his

472
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:34,199
out he can see how he pulled his
 

473
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,470
out he can see how he pulled his
shoulder down you see that that that

474
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
shoulder down you see that that that
 

475
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,110
shoulder down you see that that that
happens because of the space Gap I go

476
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
happens because of the space Gap I go
 

477
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,790
happens because of the space Gap I go
here now oh too late but as you're

478
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
here now oh too late but as you're
 

479
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,870
here now oh too late but as you're
moving and he moves do you see how that

480
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
moving and he moves do you see how that
 

481
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,230
moving and he moves do you see how that
keeps his arm there okay but stuff

482
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
keeps his arm there okay but stuff
 

483
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,470
keeps his arm there okay but stuff
happens no big deal so let's say he he

484
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,480
