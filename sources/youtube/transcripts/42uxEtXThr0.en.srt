1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
the reason i am calling you today is\h
because as you may know i've got a\h\h

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,520
keen interest in the the pioneers that went to\h
japan uh years ago and got the chance to practice\h\h

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,200
with all sensei being in japan myself the story\h
is about people like yourself uh have been very\h\h

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,560
uh influential in deciding me to go to japan now\h
of course i didn't get the chance to uh to meet\h\h

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,880
or sensei myself uh but uh you know that's perhaps\h
my way to compensate for that is actually together\h\h

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,800
the stories of the people who wear so uh\h
as you may know i uh i met alan roddock\h\h

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,240
henry connor i did meet uh ken cote as well though\h\h

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,320
i didn't know him uh personally i\h
just you know attended some seminars\h\h

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,320
and you know like uh because i've prompted\h
those people to uh to tell me their stories uh\h\h

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,840
of course your your name and that of others came\h
up and then um last january during the kamibiraki

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
i was at home at that time and you know when\h
they unveiled the names of the promoters\h\h

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,160
i saw that your name was there as i ate stan\h
and and i thought oh yeah that's true i still\h\h

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,360
have work to do in you know in recording so\h
those uh those stories so there there you go\h\h

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
that's the the that's what it is of course uh\h
you know i need to thank bob coleman for for\h\h

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,040
putting us in contact he's the one who who made\h
it happen so i guess um where i'd like to start\h\h

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:37,040
is um how you started martial arts briefly uh\h
i've read that you started with judo yes um\h\h

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:46,320
i started with judo as a freshman in college i\h
went to a small college uh reed college r-e-e-d\h\h

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,880
um and it was everyone had to take some\h
kind of pe class physical education\h\h

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,120
and uh there was a judo class being offered and\h
i thought well i was a lot more interesting than\h\h

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,680
basketball or baseball or you know the\h
usual stuff so i began uh practicing judo\h\h

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,720
we had a first q brown belt as our teacher and\h
we were in a funny like loft and i always was\h\h

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,680
afraid if you threw anybody high their feet would\h
hit the ceiling the whale sensei did with tenview

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,720
and i loved it my home was los angeles when i went\h
home for the summer i spent the summer training\h\h

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,280
with a wonderful judo teacher named hal sharp\h
and hal tried at the codicon uh in fact he was\h\h

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:55,280
the co-captain of the gaijin squad or whatever\h
they called it um and he was a very sweet very\h\h

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,920
wonderful guy i really enjoyed trey was a small\h
dojo in the san fernando valley in los angeles\h\h

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,760
we became friends and how planted\h
the seed um because i was sincere and\h\h

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
showed up a lot he said bob you know\h
you might think about going to japan\h\h

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,360
which i had never done and he said you know my\h
old teachers are still alive and if i wrote to\h\h

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,080
them i'm sure they'd be happy to put you up and\h
i thought wow what an incredible opportunity and\h\h

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,640
i started thinking about it and that thought\h
just stayed with me for the next few years um

32
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:51,120
and i would train with hal in the summers and\h
trained at um at college although i think the judo\h\h

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
class stopped after another year\h
because he graduated the teacher

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,440
and then i also started karate with ed\h
parker who was one of the very first\h\h

35
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,240
karate teachers in the united states and and\h
because i was again only there for the summer\h\h

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,240
ed and i arranged for me to have private lessons\h
with him so i would drive to pasadena which is\h\h

37
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,680
where his main dojo was and we'd train and that\h
was another wonderful door that opened for me\h\h

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,000
um so that was you know so i sort of knew\h
how to through a punch and take ukemi\h\h

39
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,840
um at least i i threw a punch in\h
the style of kempo karate which was

40
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,640
stronger than it was fast in many ways\h\h

41
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,760
and then i kept thinking gee i'd love to go\h
to japan i could train and you know i had read\h\h

42
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,600
zen in the art of archery and thought well what\h
a wonderful way to get it to know a culture

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,920
and i started applying for fellowships and i never\h
got one because i didn't have a good enough reason\h\h

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,160
i couldn't articulate you know this sort of\h
mystical notion of getting to know the soul\h\h

45
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,800
of japan through sweating um and i finally did\h
at the end of my second year in graduate school\h\h

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,960
this big package came sort of the last day\h
of the year school year and i looked at it it\h\h

47
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,160
was from the east west center in hawaii and my\h
first thought was damn they must have accepted\h\h

48
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,160
me because this is too big and substantial to\h
be a rejection letter and they said yeah bob\h\h

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
if you would like uh you can come for\h
two years all expenses paid fellowship\h\h

50
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,480
and you know then i went i negotiated and uh\h
for more time in japan because their normal\h\h

51
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,800
fellowship was a year and a half in hawaii in six\h
months in japan or china or whatever asian country\h\h

52
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,160
one wanted to go to and i thought well i may have\h
blown that but i really do want more time so i got\h\h

53
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,640
the longer stay while i was in hawaii i was\h
friendly with another student who was old was\h\h

54
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,200
a karate student and we talked about the martial\h
arts and one day he came up to me with this book\h\h

55
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:44,160
lovely illustrated large-sized book um this is\h
aikido i believe was the title it was by tohei\h\h

56
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,640
and i still remember opening it to ceo\h
sensei's picture and i sort of was just\h\h

57
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:00,160
struck by the power of his presence if you will\h
and i read memoir of the master that that section\h\h

58
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:09,360
in the book and i loved the um relatively short\h
i forget what the technical term is doka i guess\h\h

59
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,200
my japanese slowly slips away year by year when\h
kato sensei was alive he would come twice a year\h\h

60
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,680
and so get to practice translating and talking\h
with them all the time but now it's gone the\h\h

61
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:37,440
way of a lot of things as a move um and i i was\h
so taken with the book and something in me said\h\h

62
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,880
you've i've got to do this then i don't know what\h
it was you know it wasn't particularly logical um\h\h

63
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,040
i had heard of aikido before and even seen a\h
demonstration which i didn't think much of this\h\h

64
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:03,440
was early days in the earlier you know maybe 60\h
61. um you know and then multiple attack multiple\h\h

65
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:13,200
men attacks they were all holding back and i was\h
embarrassed in a way um that was in the u.s right\h\h

66
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,880
the demonstration uh the demonstration was done\h
by isao takahashi who was the man who introduced\h\h

67
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,640
aikido to the mainland um you know and he\h
was fairly competent but again it was sort\h\h

68
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,520
of key society well it was pre-key society\h
it was toe hey teach the americans and um\h\h

69
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:46,080
and he was an older man his uh his art was\h
really sword he was great kendo kendoka and\h\h

70
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
so i saw the book and i said i have to train\h\h

71
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,160
and it turns out the main dojo the hombu dojo\h
of hawaii was 15 minute drive from campus\h\h

72
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,280
so uh i started training a couple of\h
times a week in the beginner's class and i\h\h

73
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:17,840
really loved aikido and loved those sensei and\h
um so the first day i got to japan i took the\h\h

74
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:29,600
bus and found you know myself in that in wakamatsu\h
uh and it was the old dojo which i still miss it's\h\h

75
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:40,080
a beautiful traditional japanese wooden building\h
um and oh before i left uh i was yamamoto sensei

76
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,840
i think who was the chief instructor in hawaii\h
who was at great judoka judo sensei before he\h\h

77
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,320
met osensei he wrote me this beautiful letter of\h
introduction he sat me down in his little office\h\h

78
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,920
and he pulled out a really nice sheet of rice\h
paper made ink and started brushing a fancy letter\h\h

79
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,880
of introduction and told me to train well because\h
i was representing hawaii i was an american i\h\h

80
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,880
wasn't representing hawaii i didn't understand\h
that part of japanese culture particularly\h\h

81
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,720
so i went in and i handed my letter and there was\h
a it was a one-man office in those days the office\h\h

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,240
and this nice older man disappeared\h
he said you know thank you\h\h

83
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,480
and disappeared and i'm in in the genghan\h
wondering what to do seemed like forever and he\h\h

84
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:50,400
brought me to the room next to his which was the\h
room that doshu and osensei would sit in and um\h\h

85
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,800
i had full-time i mean i finished two years of\h
university conversational japanese and two years\h\h

86
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,560
of reading and writing and i just felt like a\h
schoolboy who stuttered you know i'm so honored\h\h

87
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,240
sensei i have no word i didn't say\h
i have no words but clearly i did

88
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,720
uh i'm sitting right you know in this small\h
room without sensei and and kisha marissa and\h\h

89
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,240
after a while we you know it's sort of uneasy\h
at both sides but you know there were no very\h\h

90
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,400
few foreigners were around so it sort of was a\h
big deal as you could see from those newspaper\h\h

91
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:42,640
articles you managed to take out of nowhere um\h
and i started training i oh kisho maru sensei\h\h

92
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,600
said did you bring your ghee and i said yes and he\h
took me out to the three o'clock afternoon class\h\h

93
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,400
and paired me up with an american who'd been\h
living in japan and that was the beginning\h\h

94
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,240
of my real aikido career i i jokingly said\h
i learned just enough in hawaii to get in

95
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:16,720
trouble so um that's how it started talking about\h
the uh the foreigners who were there at the time\h\h

96
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,320
um and about that aikido newspaper uh i'll i'll\h
put the i'll put up the clip there's an article in\h\h

97
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,120
the english version of the aikido newspaper that\h
states that you just arrived and at the same time\h\h

98
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,040
as henry connor can you remember who was there at\h
the time for reynolds except except you two well\h\h

99
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:47,520
it all merges you know i trained every day seven\h
days a week you know that routine i'm sure um and

100
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,720
robert nadeau was there in fact he was\h
the first one i trained with uh terry\h\h

101
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,160
dobson was living in tokyo but i had i didn't\h
meet him for months he was see running around

102
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,840
trying to import posters or something

103
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:19,680
henry was there henry allen and i became were\h
friendly and so was ken cartier virginia mayhew\h\h

104
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,640
came nine months later i think um and you know she\h
was sort of the mother of the group we were all\h\h

105
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,560
these are younger guys there was a guy well there\h
was a guy named john days who was african-american\h\h

106
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,640
only one ever trained at\h
home boo that was early years\h\h

107
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,160
uh strong he's very good there's a guy named\h
joe deischer who every once in a while you\h\h

108
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
see his picture people usually don't\h
identify him because they don't know him\h\h

109
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,560
but i knew joe joe joe actually had gone to read\h
you know i knew him from college and he's he was a\h\h

110
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,920
student of a believe it or not a japanese tai chi\h
teacher all right and that was what he focused on\h\h

111
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,040
although he also trained at hombu and he had\h
returned to the states and years later when\h\h

112
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,960
i started my own school i had him teach tai chi\h
so we stayed in touch there was joanne shimamoto\h\h

113
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,160
uh she she was training then george\h
willard that came later about a year later\h\h

114
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,520
and if you mention names i'm sure i would remember\h
them at one point i had a beautiful farewell card\h\h

115
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,480
i went back for the summer i went home\h
because my scholarship allowed me to do that\h\h

116
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,320
uh and there's you know it's a\h
big deal when you leave japan\h\h

117
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,480
you know it's a it's a it go it comes from seeing\h
you know the matson line steamer leave you know\h\h

118
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,560
so a lot of them came to see me off and\h
uh we were all we were very close there's\h\h

119
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:11,200
about a dozen people a dozen foreigners um\h
there was a swiss man who uh i think there was\h\h

120
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,440
geared wishnovsky can you study all those names\h
you probably remember them that that name is\h\h

121
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,240
the is the first time i i hear actually i\h
think the kendo as maybe judo as well um

122
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:41,200
that's that's all you know oh what happened is\h
i i created an aikido archive built on henry's\h\h

123
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,760
wonderful photographs which we archived at\h
part of the library of my school and it all\h\h

124
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:57,920
fell apart and it's sort of there but it's hard\h
not easy to access anymore and i sort of took\h\h

125
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,560
some of my best pictures to be scanned as well my\h
little collection and what i'm left with is a you\h\h

126
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,680
know is a lovely album with half the pictures\h
gone and i don't some of them i have in a bag

127
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,240
so i was um i was recently in contact with some\h
some students of henry because i also want to\h\h

128
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,640
write a piece on him for hidden and they've\h
been they they they've done the a lot of\h\h

129
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:36,480
digitizing of these pictures so you know that'd be\h
nice if you know if one day we could get those uh\h\h

130
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,320
all those pictures from those time uh you know\h
back together because as you said there are some\h\h

131
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,120
people who um whose name come up quite frequently\h
but others who are on pictures and you're not\h\h

132
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,680
quite sure who that may be or you or in some cases\h
i just have the name and i don't have much uh\h\h

133
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,840
much um like jodi i don't i don't have much on\h
except his name alan has identified most people\h\h

134
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:07,200
on the pictures that uh that that he showed me\h
uh but you know grabbing the pieces of history\h\h

135
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,000
of those various people is proving somewhat\h
somewhat challenging well i started to try to do\h\h

136
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,600
it systematically in fact i sat down um with john\h
stevens and which has lots of pictures himself\h\h

137
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,200
and and we started going through pictures and\h
talking about well who was that and when was that\h\h

138
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,840
it and you know after an hour it felt like we went\h
through only half a dozen right it was a very slow\h\h

139
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,600
process and um and i haven't i haven't really seen\h
john it's been some years now um well his health\h\h

140
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,520
hasn't been good as you probably know and he comes\h
out here he is there are some of the teachers here\h\h

141
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:57,200
love to have him teach at their dojos but\h
it's doesn't get around the way he used to\h\h

142
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,200
talking about um documenting what uh what happened\h
then i mean um i've had particular interest in\h\h

143
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,320
that english version of the aikido shin bun and um\h
i mean at least one of your articles was published\h\h

144
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,320
in there and i know that henry served as the\h
deputy editor i think it was his title associated\h\h

145
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,760
for some time um do you have any any particular\h
information on that on that newspaper how it\h\h

146
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,520
came about where the id came from to get it\h
made in english and and also perhaps how it\h\h

147
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,720
stopped because nowadays all the publications\h
are in japanese now now well uh i believe it\h\h

148
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:47,520
was uh it was started by bob nadeau he was living\h
close to the dojo and he was sort of a sotodashi

149
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,800
and trained very you know trained hard and\h
he was pretty clear he wanted to be an aikido\h\h

150
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,280
full-time aikido instructor which not\h
many people did not many foreigners\h\h

151
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,480
um so you know he had no japanese other than\h
you know can i have another scotch or a beer

152
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,920
in fact there aren't many of the foreigners\h
could speak japanese at all i mean there\h\h

153
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:27,760
was there was henry of course you know this\h
japanese canadian and there was me right um\h\h

154
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:37,840
and there may have been some well there may\h
there were some other japanese americans

155
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,840
yeah and my japanese got really quite good\h
because i was at ko university you know i would\h\h

156
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,880
train my routine ended up eight o'clock in the\h
morning class train some afterwards jump on the\h\h

157
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:05,840
uh yamate sen get to ko uh and then take\h
classes and later add research as well

158
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:17,120
and and then i became a student of tempu\h
nakamura and one week a month i would attend\h\h

159
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,240
his lectures at night so that was a very full\h
i would often leave the house you know quarter\h\h

160
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,080
after seven or something like that walk to\h
the dojo i was staying in ichigaya yeah okay\h\h

161
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,880
i stayed with don drager i did oh okay the famous\h
house yeah yet another another you know link that\h\h

162
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,720
we might want to explore with yeah yeah um\h
i walked to the dojo and then i would leave\h\h

163
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,000
for ko and then you know if i would have dinner\h
with someone or go to temple's lecture i wasn't\h\h

164
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
getting back till 11 at night right thank god i\h
was young and training i couldn't do those things

165
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,480
one that came to mind that came to mind um still\h
about that newspaper sid white is is uh is uh\h\h

166
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,080
credited as the editor of this since the first\h
issue and as you said indeed uh bob nadeau has\h\h

167
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,080
some article in the various early parts did who\h
was that sid white uh person i i've never seen uh\h\h

168
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,400
what was his name again white i don't remember it\h
but you know people would come and often not stay\h\h

169
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:36,000
for very long uh so yeah we all said some\h
people that were in the military who would\h\h

170
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,640
come down weekends haven't even sort of commuted\h
to their regular jobs but lived in tokyo so\h\h

171
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:53,840
uh i i really don't know isn't it okay okay um\h
so uh so yeah i mean living in ichigaya you were\h\h

172
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,200
literally like you know 15 minutes walk from\h
from hamburg so i presume it was more like 25.

173
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,280
because i used to live in uh in yotsuya\h
so i i uh you know that that work yeah\h\h

174
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:16,160
it's a perfect warm-up indeed indeed indeed i\h
used to go yeah i used to go there jogging and\h\h

175
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,560
and back and um so and and i'm\h
especially interested in how my you know\h\h

176
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,720
how life might have been at the time and\h
i keep asking my my senpai people who were\h\h

177
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,320
there at the time i've asked i asked christian\h
this year i asked the dj boys people like this\h\h

178
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,680
you know did you take some pictures of how things\h
were and and even henry or alan all they have is\h\h

179
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,920
his uh you know pictures of osensei and hombu\h
but i want to see how what life was like and\h\h

180
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,880
you know how the the urban urban landscape if\h
you could call it that was like at the time um\h\h

181
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,280
so you were like you were at ko um where was the\h
campus uh at that time i was at the um there were\h\h

182
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:13,360
two campuses there was one sort of out of town it\h
was a larger one that was near tokyo tower okay

183
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,840
okay and actually when i first moved to\h
japan i moved i lived for a while in nakano

184
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
yeah and um then i lived for a while\h\h

185
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,160
i had a nice little room in a japanese\h
temple right near the mita campus

186
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,920
and and then finally i met don drager i knew his\h
picture from the back of his books right and uh\h\h

187
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,000
there's a famous it was a famous bookstore one\h
of the only ones with lots of english books on\h\h

188
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,560
on the ginza i can't remember the name now and i\h
met him i introduced myself and he was interested\h\h

189
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,560
because i don't think he'd met any americans\h
that were training an aikido full-time right\h\h

190
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,120
so when a room opened up he you know he offered\h
it to me and i thought that's perfect because\h\h

191
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,480
going to aikido rapidly became more important in\h
its own way than going going to the university\h\h

192
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:30,080
so so i moved i moved into the house with two\h
other judoka and a woman who worked in tokyo that\h\h

193
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:40,000
was never around so they were oh and they were\h
one was canadian one was british of the of the uh\h\h

194
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,960
the other guys and they were relatively relatively\h
new to judo maybe showdown or something like that

195
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,000
through dragon did you did you get the chance\h
to practice any of the the koryo bujutsu that's\h\h

196
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,960
what he he did mostly i think he was i think\h
he was fed up with the politics of judah etc

197
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,840
i mean for example i know hal sharp came back\h
to the united states i believe as a knee down\h\h

198
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,640
and stayed as a knee down for years and years and\h
years and then suddenly toward the end of his life\h\h

199
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,160
there were more say or you know it was no longer\h
the old guard in charge and suddenly they finally\h\h

200
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:37,600
promoted them to eighth donna or knightsdon um but\h
yeah there was all that political not of course\h\h

201
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,120
there's politics everywhere and i never would\h
have gotten promoted to a thon if it wasn't for\h\h

202
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,000
bob corman god bless him oh really well well he\h
pushed and he was very good at documenting stuff\h\h

203
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,600
and the fact you know i really was a student of oh\h
senseis not everybody i realized that but i was um\h\h

204
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
and i trained with all the\h
homebrew teachers except i was\h\h

205
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,000
my first year is really closer to saito\h
sensei okay then second year osawa sensei\h\h

206
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,720
then i went back to the states got my degree\h
and went back to japan for postdoc research\h\h

207
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:25,520
and then after about seven years and i\h
built a dojo up at the uc santa cruz campus\h\h

208
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,160
it was a wonderful time to be teaching aikido\h
and i was really into the meditative spiritual\h\h

209
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,680
part of it and i did all the crazy things you\h
did when you're young having people line up and\h\h

210
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,760
take you know you have to take who can me over\h
five or six people and you know all that stuff\h\h

211
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:54,640
and i threw in tohei's key exercises tempos\h
uh the key and and mental exercises um

212
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:05,920
so i really had quite a few students and three\h
of my students i forget exactly three of my best\h\h

213
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:15,360
students sort of wanted to go to japan and really\h
study seriously um and they they met another santa\h\h

214
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:33,840
cruz student who sort of dabbled in aikido and\h
she said there's this amazing dojo in shingu ah
