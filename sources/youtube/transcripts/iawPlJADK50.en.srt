79
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,990
from the EDI position right so if Josh

and I are facing each other here and I
 

81
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,709
and I are facing each other here and I
come back behind him like this then I've

82
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719
come back behind him like this then I've
 

83
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,429

and I come back I shoot back here okay
 

89
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,950
and I come back I shoot back here okay
now I've made EDI any throw that happens

90
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:55,960
now I've made EDI any throw that happens
 

91
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,350
now I've made EDI any throw that happens
now is EDI nag right okay now that's a

92
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
now is EDI nag right okay now that's a
 

93
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,310
now is EDI nag right okay now that's a
little bit I'm Taking Liberties with

94
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
little bit I'm Taking Liberties with
 

95
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,910
little bit I'm Taking Liberties with
that and why I'm taking those Liberties

96
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
that and why I'm taking those Liberties
 

97
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,550
that and why I'm taking those Liberties
is because it makes a whole grouping of

98
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
is because it makes a whole grouping of
 

99
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,949
is because it makes a whole grouping of
techniques make sense together and those

100
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
techniques make sense together and those
 

101
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,070
techniques make sense together and those
things can kind of be confusing if you

102
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,080
things can kind of be confusing if you
 

103
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,270
things can kind of be confusing if you
don't name them that way so that's why I

104
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
don't name them that way so that's why I
 

105
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,869
don't name them that way so that's why I
use that convention I think I'm the only

106
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:15,879
use that convention I think I'm the only
 

107
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,589
use that convention I think I'm the only
school that uses that convention but

108
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
school that uses that convention but
 

109
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,869
school that uses that convention but
here's why I use it so when we get the

110
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:19,879
here's why I use it so when we get the
 

111
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,430
here's why I use it so when we get the
Ed position so let me just have you

112
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
Ed position so let me just have you
 

113
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,270
Ed position so let me just have you
sideways here okay so now I've made Ed

114
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
sideways here okay so now I've made Ed
 

115
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,190
sideways here okay so now I've made Ed
right this is the good position Now

116
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
right this is the good position Now
 

117
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,830
right this is the good position Now
understand I could just want to escape

118
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
understand I could just want to escape
 

119
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,949
understand I could just want to escape
from this position or I could want to

120
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:29,959
from this position or I could want to
 

121
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,710
from this position or I could want to
attack him or I could want to do all

122
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:31,720
attack him or I could want to do all
 

123
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,150
attack him or I could want to do all
kinds of things to him but what he's

124
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
kinds of things to him but what he's
 

125
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,110
kinds of things to him but what he's
going to want to do no matter what is

126
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
going to want to do no matter what is
 

127
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,790
going to want to do no matter what is
get out of the Ed me position so that's

128
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
get out of the Ed me position so that's
 

129
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,430
get out of the Ed me position so that's
what he's going to want to do right so

130
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
what he's going to want to do right so
 

131
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,830
what he's going to want to do right so
he just wants to in some way get around

132
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
he just wants to in some way get around
 

133
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,470
he just wants to in some way get around
okay so I have to have a set of skills

134
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,480
okay so I have to have a set of skills
 

135
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,790
okay so I have to have a set of skills
that keeps him from doing that so

136
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:47,800
that keeps him from doing that so
 

137
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,790
that keeps him from doing that so
regardless of what I want to do right

138
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:49,800
regardless of what I want to do right
 

139
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,309
regardless of what I want to do right
and so I know that like you know the

140
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:51,319
and so I know that like you know the
 

141
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,630
and so I know that like you know the
common thing when we're thinking about

142
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
common thing when we're thinking about
 

143
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,190
common thing when we're thinking about
iido in this era we're having right now

144
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
iido in this era we're having right now
 

145
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,790
iido in this era we're having right now
is that like oh I I must want to get

146
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
is that like oh I I must want to get
 

147
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,390
is that like oh I I must want to get
there to do something to him whether

148
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400

149
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,790

151
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,190
that's true or not he is going to want
to do something and that what he wants

152
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
to do something and that what he wants
 

153
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,270
to do something and that what he wants
to do is to turn around so I need to

154
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,280
to do is to turn around so I need to
 

155
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,430
to do is to turn around so I need to
have a set of skills for that okay now

156
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,440
have a set of skills for that okay now
 

157
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,949
have a set of skills for that okay now
one thing and this is not going to look

158
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:07,959
one thing and this is not going to look
 

159
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,670
one thing and this is not going to look
like eating Minag to you guys at all but

160
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
like eating Minag to you guys at all but
 

161
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,350
like eating Minag to you guys at all but
after I I follow it up you you'll make

162
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
after I I follow it up you you'll make
 

163
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,550
after I I follow it up you you'll make
sense to you one thing I can do to help

164
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,560
sense to you one thing I can do to help
 

165
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,430
sense to you one thing I can do to help
me if he tries to do that is

166
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,440
me if he tries to do that is
 

167
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,229
me if he tries to do that is
this okay so if I shove him away from me

168
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
this okay so if I shove him away from me
 

169
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,309
this okay so if I shove him away from me
when he turns around I will have the

170
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
when he turns around I will have the
 

171
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,149
when he turns around I will have the
distance I want right so remember I had

172
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:25,159
distance I want right so remember I had
 

173
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,509
distance I want right so remember I had
to go e because there was a positioning

174
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
to go e because there was a positioning
 

175
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,229
to go e because there was a positioning
Pro or a distancing problem that became

176
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
Pro or a distancing problem that became
 

177
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,910
Pro or a distancing problem that became
a positioning problem right so what I

178
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
a positioning problem right so what I
 

179
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,990
a positioning problem right so what I
mean by that is if we were at our ideal

180
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
mean by that is if we were at our ideal
 

181
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,710
mean by that is if we were at our ideal
distance and he breaks it down so he's

182
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
distance and he breaks it down so he's
 

183
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,750
distance and he breaks it down so he's
faster than me or whatever I now have a

184
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
faster than me or whatever I now have a
 

185
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,309
faster than me or whatever I now have a
positioning problem so a distance

186
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319
positioning problem so a distance
 

187
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,710
positioning problem so a distance
problem turned into a positioning

188
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
problem turned into a positioning
 

189
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,910
problem turned into a positioning
problem when I position I no longer have

190
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:42,920
problem when I position I no longer have
 

191
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,030
problem when I position I no longer have
a positioning problem but if he turns

192
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
a positioning problem but if he turns
 

193
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,949
a positioning problem but if he turns
back around he just counteracted

194
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
back around he just counteracted
 

195
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,149
back around he just counteracted
everything I did so if I were simply to

196
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:49,159
everything I did so if I were simply to
 

197
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,470
everything I did so if I were simply to
shove this guy away from me I now have

198
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,480
shove this guy away from me I now have
 

199
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,869
shove this guy away from me I now have
distance so not only did I solve my

200
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:53,879
distance so not only did I solve my
 

201
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,470
distance so not only did I solve my
positioning problem I made it a

202
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,480
positioning problem I made it a
 

203
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,390
positioning problem I made it a
distancing problem again which is what I

204
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
distancing problem again which is what I
 

205
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,190
distancing problem again which is what I
want so I'm up cycling right so I'm

206
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
want so I'm up cycling right so I'm
 

207
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,390
want so I'm up cycling right so I'm
going up up in cycles of what I want

208
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,400
going up up in cycles of what I want
 

209
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,910
going up up in cycles of what I want
right okay so that's really good for me

210
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
right okay so that's really good for me
 

211
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,149
right okay so that's really good for me
all right now A that's not always going

212
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
all right now A that's not always going
 

213
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,309
all right now A that's not always going
to work and b sometimes well let's just

214
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:09,319
to work and b sometimes well let's just
 

215
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,869
to work and b sometimes well let's just
go with a first so so when we're here if

216
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
go with a first so so when we're here if
 

217
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,149
go with a first so so when we're here if
he turns really cleverly right into me

218
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:15,159
he turns really cleverly right into me
 

219
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,150
he turns really cleverly right into me
and I shove him this is what's going to

220
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,160
and I shove him this is what's going to
 

221
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,949
and I shove him this is what's going to
happen right okay so I can't get that

222
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
happen right okay so I can't get that
 

223
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,710
happen right okay so I can't get that
shove off because he's just going to

224
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
shove off because he's just going to
 

225
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,990
shove off because he's just going to
turn right around it now if as he turns

226
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
turn right around it now if as he turns
 

227
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,909
turn right around it now if as he turns
around it I go here we start to get what

228
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:26,919
around it I go here we start to get what
 

229
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,270
around it I go here we start to get what
looks like a classic edting Minag to

230
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
looks like a classic edting Minag to
 

231
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,870
looks like a classic edting Minag to
people right so and I think a lot of

232
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
people right so and I think a lot of
 

233
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,510
people right so and I think a lot of
people have the idea that edim Minag is

234
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:32,520
people have the idea that edim Minag is
 

235
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,469
people have the idea that edim Minag is
a clothline I don't really think in any

236
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:35,479
a clothline I don't really think in any
 

237
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,670
a clothline I don't really think in any
style of iido that edim Minag is a

238
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
style of iido that edim Minag is a
 

239
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,510
style of iido that edim Minag is a
clothes line I think what it

240
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
clothes line I think what it
 

241
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,590
clothes line I think what it
consistently is is a controlling of the

242
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:42,600
consistently is is a controlling of the
 

243
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,230
consistently is is a controlling of the
head so here I have Josh's head

244
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
head so here I have Josh's head
 

245
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,390
head so here I have Josh's head
controlled so if Josh tries to turn

246
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,400
controlled so if Josh tries to turn
 

247
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,590
controlled so if Josh tries to turn
towards me that really sucks right and

248
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
towards me that really sucks right and
 

249
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,629
towards me that really sucks right and
the more he tries to turn towards me the

250
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:49,639
the more he tries to turn towards me the
 

251
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,590
the more he tries to turn towards me the
more he comes off balance which is good

252
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
more he comes off balance which is good
 

253
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,749
more he comes off balance which is good
for me because now he can't get the

254
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
for me because now he can't get the
 

255
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,950
for me because now he can't get the
position he wants so this is the

256
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:55,960
position he wants so this is the
 

257
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,710
position he wants so this is the
foundation of why our Ed Minag happen I

258
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
foundation of why our Ed Minag happen I
 

259
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,990
foundation of why our Ed Minag happen I
got to the Ed position and then from the

260
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,000
got to the Ed position and then from the
 

261
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,270
got to the Ed position and then from the
edme position this guy is going to want

262
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
edme position this guy is going to want
 

263
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,550
edme position this guy is going to want
to do something to me so how do I head

264
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,560
to do something to me so how do I head
 

265
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,909
to do something to me so how do I head
that off all right now I said you know

266
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
that off all right now I said you know
 

267
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,629
that off all right now I said you know
this doesn't look that much like an ed

268
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:09,639
this doesn't look that much like an ed
 

269
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,670
this doesn't look that much like an ed
Minag um but I'll show you why it does

270
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
Minag um but I'll show you why it does
 

271
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,830
Minag um but I'll show you why it does
look like it so in some styles of iido

272
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:14,840
look like it so in some styles of iido
 

273
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,909
look like it so in some styles of iido
you will see where uh someone comes back

274
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:16,919
you will see where uh someone comes back
 

275
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,270
you will see where uh someone comes back
here and they grab the collar and they

276
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,280
here and they grab the collar and they
 

277
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,270
here and they grab the collar and they
drive this guy down to the mat like this

278
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
drive this guy down to the mat like this
 

279
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,469
drive this guy down to the mat like this
and then as he comes up I throw Ed Minag

280
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
and then as he comes up I throw Ed Minag
 

281
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,230
and then as he comes up I throw Ed Minag
now if you're like me you saw that and

282
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,240
now if you're like me you saw that and
 

283
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,150
now if you're like me you saw that and
you said

284
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
you said
 

285
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,590
you said
uh that's that's a dumb thing to do why

286
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
uh that's that's a dumb thing to do why
 

287
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,309
uh that's that's a dumb thing to do why
would you push someone down and then

288
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:34,319
would you push someone down and then
 

289
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,990
would you push someone down and then
pull them up and then throw them well I

290
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
pull them up and then throw them well I
 

291
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,150
pull them up and then throw them well I
believe what's being shown in that form

292
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,160
believe what's being shown in that form
 

293
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,950
believe what's being shown in that form
is me doing essentially this right and

294
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:43,960
is me doing essentially this right and
 

295
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,830
is me doing essentially this right and
when I do it Josh is doing essentially

296
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
when I do it Josh is doing essentially
 

297
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,309
when I do it Josh is doing essentially
the thing I showed you he could do which

298
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:47,319
the thing I showed you he could do which
 

299
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,150
the thing I showed you he could do which
is this okay and then he got low right

300
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,160
is this okay and then he got low right
 

301
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,790
is this okay and then he got low right
which is even smart so he added a step

302
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
which is even smart so he added a step
 

303
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,189
which is even smart so he added a step
to it which is he got low which makes it

304
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199
to it which is he got low which makes it
 

305
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,670
to it which is he got low which makes it
even harder for me to control right okay

306
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:56,680
even harder for me to control right okay
 

307
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,270
even harder for me to control right okay
and then when he does that I stick with

308
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
and then when he does that I stick with
 

309
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,469
and then when he does that I stick with
him and try to shove him down so I'm

310
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:01,479
him and try to shove him down so I'm
 

311
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:02,469
him and try to shove him down so I'm
trying to push him down because he

312
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
trying to push him down because he
 

313
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,350
trying to push him down because he
already went low then he doesn't want to

314
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
already went low then he doesn't want to
 

315
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,950
already went low then he doesn't want to
go low so he comes up and there's where

316
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:05,960
go low so he comes up and there's where
 

317
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,550
go low so he comes up and there's where
our Yim Minag comes off okay so that

318
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
our Yim Minag comes off okay so that
 

319
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,230
our Yim Minag comes off okay so that
whole form I think is showing a series

320
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
whole form I think is showing a series
 

321
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,070
whole form I think is showing a series
of throws that is going incorrectly

322
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
of throws that is going incorrectly
 

323
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,350
of throws that is going incorrectly
right so that's why I think we need to

324
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,360
right so that's why I think we need to
 

325
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,670
right so that's why I think we need to
kind of put it together in this way to

326
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
kind of put it together in this way to
 

327
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,029
kind of put it together in this way to
make sense out of what edim nag is edim

328
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:20,039
make sense out of what edim nag is edim
 

329
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,270
make sense out of what edim nag is edim
nag is simply a throw that happens once

you've achieved the idimi position now

332
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
you've achieved the idimi position now
 

333
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,710
you've achieved the idimi position now
that throw can be a lot of things right

334
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:25,720
that throw can be a lot of things right
 

335
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,510
that throw can be a lot of things right
so uh when I did styles of kung fu and

336
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
so uh when I did styles of kung fu and
 

337
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,749
so uh when I did styles of kung fu and
you see yba do this too uh we learned to

338
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
you see yba do this too uh we learned to
 

339
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,510
you see yba do this too uh we learned to
grab the neck and drive him back like

340
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
grab the neck and drive him back like
 

341
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,670
grab the neck and drive him back like
this right so that could be Ed Minag

342
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
this right so that could be Ed Minag
 

343
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,430
this right so that could be Ed Minag
right I could get tight to him here and

344
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
right I could get tight to him here and
 

345
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,150
right I could get tight to him here and
as he turns that could be Ed Minag cyto

346
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
as he turns that could be Ed Minag cyto
 

347
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,950
as he turns that could be Ed Minag cyto

that could be an ed nag so any throw

358
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:50,919
that could be an ed nag so any throw
 

359
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,830
that could be an ed nag so any throw
that happens after the edei position has

360
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
that happens after the edei position has
 

361
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,550
that happens after the edei position has
been achieved and the throw is happening

362
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:55,560
been achieved and the throw is happening
 

363
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,790
been achieved and the throw is happening
because he won't want me to be here

364
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:57,800
because he won't want me to be here
 

365
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,950
because he won't want me to be here
right he'll want to adjust this to an

366
00:06:59,950 --> 00:06:59,960
right he'll want to adjust this to an
 

367
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,189
right he'll want to adjust this to an
advantageous position to him anytime a

368
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
advantageous position to him anytime a
 

369
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,670

throw comes off there that is an Ed

370
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
throw comes off there that is an Ed
 

371
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,670

nuget and there's lots and lots of ways

372
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:06,680
nuget and there's lots and lots of ways
 

373
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,350
nuget and there's lots and lots of ways
those could play out so I'm not going to

374
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,360
those could play out so I'm not going to
 

375
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,309
those could play out so I'm not going to
go into a ton of the details I think I

376
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
go into a ton of the details I think I
 

377
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,790
go into a ton of the details I think I
gave you enough of the the pieces to

378
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,800
gave you enough of the the pieces to
 

379
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,550
gave you enough of the the pieces to
work with if you guys want to see

380
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
work with if you guys want to see

specific details on how the Ed Naga

382
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:15,639
specific details on how the Ed Naga
 

383
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,710
specific details on how the Ed Naga
techniques come off I can do those but I

384
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:17,720
techniques come off I can do those but I
 

385
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,350
techniques come off I can do those but I
think this this really should start to

386
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
think this this really should start to
 

387
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,350
think this this really should start to
reframe it for you and if you allow this

388
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
reframe it for you and if you allow this
 

389
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,110
reframe it for you and if you allow this
reframing to kind of come into your

390
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
reframing to kind of come into your
 

391
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,390
reframing to kind of come into your
perception as you look at your details

392
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
perception as you look at your details
 

393
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,589
perception as you look at your details
for the techniques they'll probably

394
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:26,599
for the techniques they'll probably
 

395
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,390
for the techniques they'll probably
start hashing out because that's kind of

396
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
start hashing out because that's kind of
 

397
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,710
start hashing out because that's kind of
what happened to me is once once I

what happened to me is once once I
 

399
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,309
what happened to me is once once I
started saying oh I think edim nag

400
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:31,319
started saying oh I think edim nag
 

401
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,749
started saying oh I think edim nag
should just be a throw that comes after

402
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:32,759
should just be a throw that comes after
 

403
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,270
should just be a throw that comes after
the EDI then as I looked at other iido

404
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
the EDI then as I looked at other iido
 

405
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,629
the EDI then as I looked at other iido
styles I was like oh that's why they're

406
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
styles I was like oh that's why they're
 

407
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,150
styles I was like oh that's why they're
doing this here and why they're doing

408
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
doing this here and why they're doing
 

409
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,749
doing this here and why they're doing
this here and it all began to make a lot

410
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
this here and it all began to make a lot
 

411
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,990
this here and it all began to make a lot
more sense to me so I think this is a a

412
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
more sense to me so I think this is a a
 

413
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,869
more sense to me so I think this is a a
nice overview to start to look at idag

414
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:43,879
nice overview to start to look at idag
 

415
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,110
nice overview to start to look at idag
idag is like KAG in that it's a

416
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
idag is like KAG in that it's a
 

417
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,670
idag is like KAG in that it's a
technique that a lot of people say oh

418
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:48,680
technique that a lot of people say oh
 

419
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,869
technique that a lot of people say oh
that's an edim Minag when you're like I

420
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
that's an edim Minag when you're like I
 

421
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,550
that's an edim Minag when you're like I
don't know if that's an idag why is that

422
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
don't know if that's an idag why is that
 

423
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,550
don't know if that's an idag why is that
an edag but in my school it's really

424
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
an edag but in my school it's really
 

425
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,149
an edag but in my school it's really
simple if they've achieved the edmi

426
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:56,159
simple if they've achieved the edmi
 

427
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,790
simple if they've achieved the edmi
position and then whatever is happening

428
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:57,800
position and then whatever is happening
 

429
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,550
position and then whatever is happening
to keep him from getting out of the Ed

430
00:07:59,550 --> 00:07:59,560
to keep him from getting out of the Ed
 

431
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,629
to keep him from getting out of the Ed
position a throw happens a projection

432
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:01,639
position a throw happens a projection
 

433
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,270
position a throw happens a projection
happens then that is an ed me nag all

434
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,280
happens then that is an ed me nag all
 

435
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,430
happens then that is an ed me nag all
