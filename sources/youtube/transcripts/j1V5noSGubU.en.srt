is not our chest stays out
 

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,330
is not our chest stays out
my chest is out and there is almost like

an expansion and a lowering of the last
 

39
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,559
an expansion and a lowering of the last
so and this would be no expansion of the

00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:30,569
so and this would be no expansion of the
 

41
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:37,160
so and this would be no expansion of the
lots with their down expansion I'm here

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,170
lots with their down expansion I'm here
 

43
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,800
lots with their down expansion I'm here
like this my chest stays open I don't

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,810
like this my chest stays open I don't
 

45
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,220
like this my chest stays open I don't
want to stick my chest out

here with my forearm so its height its
 

65
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,860
here with my forearm so its height its
depth and it's with our very important
