i think we switched over
so

82
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
so
 

83
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,709
so

84
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
the difference is someone on my level
 

85
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,870

it's

92
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
it's
 

93
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,309
it's
it's mass

94
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
it's mass
 

95
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,110
it's mass
so

96
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
so
 

97
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,150
so
nobody's thinking who's the winner we

98
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
nobody's thinking who's the winner we
 

99
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,070
nobody's thinking who's the winner we
can see it so

100
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
can see it so
 

101
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,869

but he'll sit out his eye
 

173
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,869
but he'll sit out his eye
so we go here and i come really close

174
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
so we go here and i come really close
 

175
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,470
so we go here and i come really close
but here

176
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
but here
 

177
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,110
but here
you know because i'm now the one cutting

178
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
you know because i'm now the one cutting
 

179
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,309
you know because i'm now the one cutting
first

180
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319

181
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,630
first
he has to back off

182
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
he has to back off
 

183
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,550
he has to back off
then it goes back to his standard

184
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
then it goes back to his standard
 

185
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:08,789
then it goes back to his standard
standard

187
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,910

so each time we can see who's got to

188
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
so each time we can see who's got to
 

189
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,789
so each time we can see who's got to
lose

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,509
lose
there's no question

192
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519

 

193
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,469

i covered my head you see all these
 

207
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,430
i covered my head you see all these
principles

208
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
principles
 

209
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,510
principles
have to be worked out the same a lot of

210
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
have to be worked out the same a lot of
 

211

you make whatever's there and you'll
make them here

256
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960

 

257
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:13,510

and that jump then becomes

258
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520

 

259
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,950

295
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,430

and who's supposed to be the winner

296

i'm sorry
 

301
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,029
i'm sorry
and that's why i've converted this

302
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
and that's why i've converted this
 

303
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,270
and that's why i've converted this
because it shouldn't

304
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
because it shouldn't
 

305
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,270
because it shouldn't
come into question

306
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280

 

307
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,909

so what i do is when it's in movement

308
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
so what i do is when it's in movement
 

309
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,629
so what i do is when it's in movement
slowly

310
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639

 

311
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,150

i go oh

312
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
i go oh
 

313
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
i go oh
and i push off that front leg

314
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
and i push off that front leg
 

315
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,309
and i push off that front leg
now he's winning or unleashing

316
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
now he's winning or unleashing
 

317

he comes in but as he comes in i see his
back leg

322
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
back leg
 

323
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,909
back leg
so i start going here

324
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
so i start going here
 

325
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,469
so i start going here
but he's gone out the circle so actually

326
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
but he's gone out the circle so actually
 

327
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,150
but he's gone out the circle so actually
he won't win

328

and i win again
so

332
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
so
 

333
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,550
so
really the fifth can attach you is a bit

334
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
really the fifth can attach you is a bit
 

335
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,070
really the fifth can attach you is a bit
like saying

336
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
like saying
 

337
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,909
like saying
but you've got all your wetting scrolls

338
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
but you've got all your wetting scrolls
 

339
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,749
but you've got all your wetting scrolls
and now you're going to get the master's

340
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
and now you're going to get the master's
 

341
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,909
and now you're going to get the master's
degree it's the fifth room attaches

342
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
degree it's the fifth room attaches
 

343
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,589
degree it's the fifth room attaches
basically when you've got all the others

344
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
basically when you've got all the others
