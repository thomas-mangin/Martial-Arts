map tonight there should be 20 different
fifths of bires because I I should be
looking at 20
individuals I don't want to look at a
Sausage Factory where all the sausages
are the
same we have a style where
hey
hey hey you know somebody might go he's
a cyto Sensi student and I'd be pleased
if they say
it
but
if I don't move down
there and I start doing
this you see how jerky it's now becoming
cuz I have to sort of lunge into it all
of a
sudden so you want to spend as much time
as you
can

sense so he's got yeah what he's done by
the time I get over here he's decided to
soften a little
bit so there's two ways of doing the Kos
subot attach there's a long verse and a
short verse so we'll do the long one
first where they do the third subur each
do it again do it
again do it
again
okay see I didn't teach them anything
what I done was I said to them
concentrate
because if not it'll just become a load
of movements and I don't want a load of
movement
again
again so they've got to work out what
they're doing
wrong

of their adrenaline and the
concentration stop do it again what's
