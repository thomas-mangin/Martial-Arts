powerful looking at him R but I don't
actually feel it so you won't feel Coke
you you won't feel your own
power it's
difficult you will feel your strength

you keep doing it long enough you'll
Coke you this mon

to what me and Ronnie were talking about

this key power or power that you can't
see and that's what you saw in the O

he used to sort of like call them up and
and they'd be falling back down before
they could get on their feet and they
and people go why is they why are they
rolling about and it's cuz
obviously and I hopefully don't want to
get nearer to death just yet but uh but
I think the near closer we get to death
