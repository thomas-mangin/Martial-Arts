cross so you got to take this
 

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,550
cross so you got to take this
shape and it has to start

17
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,429

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
there so that these three things that

okay uh we'll focus in on just a couple

378
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
okay uh we'll focus in on just a couple
 

379
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,590
okay uh we'll focus in on just a couple
uh one is going to we'll do the hand

380
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:24,600
uh one is going to we'll do the hand
 

381
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,310
uh one is going to we'll do the hand
work and then I'll show you where the

382
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
work and then I'll show you where the
 

383
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,190
work and then I'll show you where the
adashi is um and you'll see that the

384
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,200
adashi is um and you'll see that the
 

385
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,670
adashi is um and you'll see that the
it's going to come back to this overall

386
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:32,680
it's going to come back to this overall
 

387
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,790
it's going to come back to this overall

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,000
am I doing the next pattern and throwing
 

391
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,389
am I doing the next pattern and throwing
from control versus transaction okay

392
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
from control versus transaction okay
 

393
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,829
from control versus transaction okay
that's where we'll go now so we have uh

394
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
that's where we'll go now so we have uh
 

395
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,949
that's where we'll go now so we have uh

please we have lots of videos on on this

398
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,600
please we have lots of videos on on this
 

399
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,550
please we have lots of videos on on this
technique so I'm not going to show

400
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
technique so I'm not going to show
 

401
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,030
technique so I'm not going to show
everything a bunch of detail again I

402
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
everything a bunch of detail again I
 

403
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,230
everything a bunch of detail again I
want to just focus on the hand workk and

404
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
want to just focus on the hand workk and
 

405
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,030
want to just focus on the hand workk and
how to throw from control okay uh

406
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
how to throw from control okay uh
 

407
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,670
how to throw from control okay uh
but this is a counter rotation so

408
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:06,680
but this is a counter rotation so
 

409
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,310
but this is a counter rotation so
normally we would come in something like

410
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
normally we would come in something like
 

411
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,110
normally we would come in something like
this okay and do whatever so he's going

412
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
this okay and do whatever so he's going
 

413
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,190
this okay and do whatever so he's going
around that way and I go around that way

414
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
around that way and I go around that way
 

415
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,910
around that way and I go around that way
okay this one is a counter rotation

416
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:18,920
okay this one is a counter rotation
 

417
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,870
okay this one is a counter rotation
where I'm going the opposite way of him

418
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:21,880
where I'm going the opposite way of him
 

419
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,470
where I'm going the opposite way of him
okay I don't turn where he's

420
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
okay I don't turn where he's
 

421
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,949
okay I don't turn where he's
turning um and it's important to note

422
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
turning um and it's important to note
 

423
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,069
turning um and it's important to note
that because that counter ation for

424
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
that because that counter ation for
 

425
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,870
that because that counter ation for

Ronin where I first showed what is a

428
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
Ronin where I first showed what is a
 

429
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,949
Ronin where I first showed what is a
marshall application of iido is as I

430
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:37,959
marshall application of iido is as I
 

431
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,269
marshall application of iido is as I
start spiral rotating the fight and he

432
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279
start spiral rotating the fight and he
 

433
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,790
start spiral rotating the fight and he
tries to cut me off then I'll counter

434
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
tries to cut me off then I'll counter
 

435
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,190
tries to cut me off then I'll counter
rotate and do that a lot okay and really

436
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,200
rotate and do that a lot okay and really
 

437
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,470
rotate and do that a lot okay and really
that's where this shows up if you don't

438
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
that's where this shows up if you don't
 

439
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,069
that's where this shows up if you don't
rotate the fight you'll never see Tenon

440
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
rotate the fight you'll never see Tenon
 

441
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,430
rotate the fight you'll never see Tenon
and you'll never see counter rotation is

442
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:54,440
and you'll never see counter rotation is
 

443
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,110
and you'll never see counter rotation is
absolutely never going to show up in

444
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
absolutely never going to show up in
 

445
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,030
absolutely never going to show up in
your Marshall situation okay so for

446
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,040
your Marshall situation okay so for
 

447
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,190
your Marshall situation okay so for
example you'll have a lot of boxers and

448
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,200
example you'll have a lot of boxers and
 

449
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,670
example you'll have a lot of boxers and
they never counter rotate or I'm sorry

450
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:04,680
they never counter rotate or I'm sorry
 

451
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,110
they never counter rotate or I'm sorry
they never counter rotate because they

452
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,120
they never counter rotate because they
 

453
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,949
they never counter rotate because they
never rotate you'll have those fighters

454
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
never rotate you'll have those fighters
 

455
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,870
never rotate you'll have those fighters
who will rotate and you will see Tenon

456
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,880
who will rotate and you will see Tenon
 

457
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,590
who will rotate and you will see Tenon
in boxing this people don't recognize it

458
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:14,600
in boxing this people don't recognize it
 

459
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,990
in boxing this people don't recognize it
but it is in there okay they're counter

460
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,000
but it is in there okay they're counter
 

461
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,350
but it is in there okay they're counter
rotating when you see that kind of stuff

462
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
rotating when you see that kind of stuff
 

463
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,189
rotating when you see that kind of stuff
okay so uh that's why it makes no sense

464
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:24,199
okay so uh that's why it makes no sense
 

465
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:25,949
okay so uh that's why it makes no sense
that

466
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:25,959
that
 

467
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,910
that
um this kind of stuff y around you see

468
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
um this kind of stuff y around you see
 

469
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,750
um this kind of stuff y around you see
and I'm here and he walks around me and

470
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
and I'm here and he walks around me and
 

471
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,389
and I'm here and he walks around me and
then I

472
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:33,399
then I
 

473
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,269
then I
throw I have to start a counter

474
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:36,279
throw I have to start a counter
 

475
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,670
throw I have to start a counter
rotation so the the counter rotation is

476
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
rotation so the the counter rotation is
 

477
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,629
rotation so the the counter rotation is
I'm going this way and then he came

478
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:41,639
I'm going this way and then he came
 

479
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,269
I'm going this way and then he came
around and I came the other way that has

480
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:44,279
around and I came the other way that has
 

481
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,829
around and I came the other way that has
to be in there okay resist the

482
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:46,839
to be in there okay resist the
 

483
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,310
to be in there okay resist the
temptation that I'm here and goes here

484
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,320
temptation that I'm here and goes here
 

485
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,550
temptation that I'm here and goes here
and then I accelerate

486
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:53,560

 

487
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,509

back um another quick thing

488
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
back um another quick thing
 

489
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,590
back um another quick thing
here is it is a legitimate

490
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
here is it is a legitimate
 

491
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,030
here is it is a legitimate
attack it is a legitimate attack see uh

492
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,040
attack it is a legitimate attack see uh
 

493
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,230
attack it is a legitimate attack see uh
to get the arm and you have this throw

494
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
to get the arm and you have this throw
 

495
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,550
to get the arm and you have this throw
here it it's very very

496
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,560
here it it's very very
 

497
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,030
here it it's very very
powerful when done full speed you don't

498
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,040
powerful when done full speed you don't
 

499
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,189
powerful when done full speed you don't
need anything fancy just grab the wrist

500
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:18,199
need anything fancy just grab the wrist
 

501
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,310
need anything fancy just grab the wrist
and pull them

502
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:19,320
and pull them
 

503
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,189
and pull them
backwards um there's only been one time

504
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:22,199
backwards um there's only been one time
 

505
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,750
backwards um there's only been one time
where I threw roning onto his head and

506
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:24,760
where I threw roning onto his head and
 

507
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,590
where I threw roning onto his head and
it's on that technique and if you want

508

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,560
to see it it's in one of the manual
 

511
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,389
to see it it's in one of the manual
compilations we have two of those videos

512
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
compilations we have two of those videos
 

513
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,189
compilations we have two of those videos
I don't know which one but it's the one

514

I don't know which one but it's the one
 

515
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,269
I don't know which one but it's the one
time I've freaking dropped them on his

516
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:36,279
time I've freaking dropped them on his
 

517
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,629
time I've freaking dropped them on his
head okay it's extremely

518
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
head okay it's extremely
 

519
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,030
head okay it's extremely
powerful um and it's a good one for your

520
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
powerful um and it's a good one for your
 

521
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,629
powerful um and it's a good one for your
bag of tricks where you don't need

522
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
bag of tricks where you don't need
 

523
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,750
bag of tricks where you don't need
anything fancy okay and that's what's

524
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
anything fancy okay and that's what's
 

525
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,509
anything fancy okay and that's what's
kind of going on here sort of okay all

526
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
kind of going on here sort of okay all
 

527
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,110
kind of going on here sort of okay all
right so we also know the third thing

528
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
right so we also know the third thing
 

529
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,790
right so we also know the third thing
that we only have two

530
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
that we only have two
 

531
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,269
that we only have two
handshakes that's all I have um I don't

532
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:58,279
handshakes that's all I have um I don't
 

533
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,189
handshakes that's all I have um I don't
have this one

534
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,199
have this one
 

535
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,550
have this one
I never have this one okay uh I don't

536
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,560
I never have this one okay uh I don't
 

537
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,310
I never have this one okay uh I don't
have this one either a lot of people in

538
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
have this one either a lot of people in
 

539
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,389
have this one either a lot of people in
the Federation will understand like if I

540
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:09,399
the Federation will understand like if I
 

541
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,550
the Federation will understand like if I
leave my skeletal alignment then I feel

542
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
leave my skeletal alignment then I feel
 

543
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,870
leave my skeletal alignment then I feel
very strong you see very strong when I

544
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
very strong you see very strong when I
 

545
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,389
very strong you see very strong when I
do that so you'll see people will will

546
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
do that so you'll see people will will
 

547
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,670
do that so you'll see people will will
do that kind of stuff B strong never

548
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
do that kind of stuff B strong never
 

549
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,590
do that kind of stuff B strong never

give him a
 

551
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,389
give him a
Advantage okay or they'll seek a lot of

do this kind of stuff you see so he's

556
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
do this kind of stuff you see so he's
 

557
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,910
do this kind of stuff you see so he's
really olding me and they'll move their

558
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
really olding me and they'll move their
 

559
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,590
really olding me and they'll move their
Center you see and they hit these very

560
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:40,600
Center you see and they hit these very
 

561
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,069
Center you see and they hit these very
small elbows but the fight stops so it's

562
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:43,079
small elbows but the fight stops so it's
 

563
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,189
small elbows but the fight stops so it's
just okay um and because it's

564
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
just okay um and because it's
 

565
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,350
just okay um and because it's
just a leverage technique someone's

566
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
just a leverage technique someone's
 

567
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,310
just a leverage technique someone's
strong enough you're not going to get

568
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,320
strong enough you're not going to get
 

569
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,829
strong enough you're not going to get
the leverage it's just not going to

570
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:52,839
the leverage it's just not going to
 

571
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,670
the leverage it's just not going to
happen Okay and those aren't our shapes

572
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
happen Okay and those aren't our shapes
 

573
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,350
happen Okay and those aren't our shapes
we can't use those shapes they don't do

574
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
we can't use those shapes they don't do
 

575
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,069
we can't use those shapes they don't do
anything for my energetics

576
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
anything for my energetics
 

577
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,670
anything for my energetics
um and so they don't do anything for my

578
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:02,680
um and so they don't do anything for my
 

579
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,710
um and so they don't do anything for my
deconstruction of the egoic mind so when

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:05,720
deconstruction of the egoic mind so when
 

581
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,910
deconstruction of the egoic mind so when
he comes

582
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:06,920
he comes
 

583
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,949
he comes
around you have to

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,509
around you have to
find is

586
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:12,519
find is
 

587
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,269
find is
she because we don't film the teacher

588
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
she because we don't film the teacher
 

589
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,590
she because we don't film the teacher
back you have to

590
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
back you have to
 

591
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,910
back you have to
find the inward

592
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:20,920
find the inward
 

593
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,990
find the inward
spiral okay he comes in and I'm

594
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
spiral okay he comes in and I'm
 

595
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,550
spiral okay he comes in and I'm
doing okay but I have to do it

596
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,560
doing okay but I have to do it
 

597
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,350
doing okay but I have to do it
in a way that I'm not contesting his

598
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
in a way that I'm not contesting his
 

599
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,790
in a way that I'm not contesting his
energy so as his energy goes

600
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
energy so as his energy goes
 

601
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,269
energy so as his energy goes
down I can turn to keep that

602
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
down I can turn to keep that
 

603
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,910
down I can turn to keep that
neutral okay we'll do it again you know

604
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
neutral okay we'll do it again you know
 

605
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,150
neutral okay we'll do it again you know
we're going to turn this way camera stay

606
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
we're going to turn this way camera stay
 

607
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,670
we're going to turn this way camera stay
there one I move keep it neutral okay do

608
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:54,680
there one I move keep it neutral okay do
 

609
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,150
there one I move keep it neutral okay do
it one more

610
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
it one more
 

611
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,990
it one more
time so I have to rotate

612
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
time so I have to rotate
 

613
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,350
time so I have to rotate
and that starts the counter rotation

614
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,360
and that starts the counter rotation
 

615
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,509
and that starts the counter rotation
okay and then here is that opening that

616
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
okay and then here is that opening that
 

617
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,030
okay and then here is that opening that
you would use the counter rotation for

618
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,040
you would use the counter rotation for
 

619
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,110
you would use the counter rotation for
stay there please just move your arm out

620
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,120
stay there please just move your arm out
 

621
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,069
stay there please just move your arm out
of the way here's where you move to do

622
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
of the way here's where you move to do
 

623
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,509
of the way here's where you move to do
all those kind of manles

624
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:16,519
all those kind of manles
 

625
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,710
all those kind of manles
okay

626
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720

 

627
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,470

so don't come back in the diagonal

628
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:23,480
so don't come back in the diagonal
 

629
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,430
so don't come back in the diagonal
there's no rotation there and you can

630
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
there's no rotation there and you can
 

631
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,990
there's no rotation there and you can
see I'm not on that angle

632
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000

 

633
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,550

my body rotates and there's that angle

634
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:33,560
my body rotates and there's that angle
 

635
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,710
my body rotates and there's that angle
right there okay do the other side body

636
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:37,720
right there okay do the other side body
 

637
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,309
right there okay do the other side body
rotate that's the angle I want I'm just

638
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:41,319
rotate that's the angle I want I'm just
 

639
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:44,790
rotate that's the angle I want I'm just
looking at this part here and the foot

640
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
looking at this part here and the foot
 

641
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,710
looking at this part here and the foot
work so because I rotate I can counter

642
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:49,720
work so because I rotate I can counter
 

643
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,590
work so because I rotate I can counter
rotate rotate and I can counter

644
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600

 

645
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,350

rotate rotate I can counter rotate

646
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360

 

647
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,750

boom boom now watch my hips and you'll

648
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
boom boom now watch my hips and you'll
 

649
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,390
boom boom now watch my hips and you'll
see what I mean hips turn hips

650
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400

 

651
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,069

turn hips turn hips

652
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079

 

653
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,029

turn turn turn okay so I'll get how do

654
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
turn turn turn okay so I'll get how do
 

655
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,510
turn turn turn okay so I'll get how do
we get the arm over I was doing it but

656
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
we get the arm over I was doing it but
 

657
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,710
we get the arm over I was doing it but
not all the way okay let's try

658
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
not all the way okay let's try
 

659
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,270
not all the way okay let's try
that all right so my and this hand

660
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
that all right so my and this hand
 

661
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,390
that all right so my and this hand
here is going to go into the inward

662
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
here is going to go into the inward
 

663
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,470
here is going to go into the inward
spiral and then I turn as it's

664
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,480
spiral and then I turn as it's
 

665
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,510
spiral and then I turn as it's
continuing its inward

666
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,520
continuing its inward
 

667
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,470
continuing its inward
spiral so my hand doesn't

668
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
spiral so my hand doesn't
 

669
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,270
spiral so my hand doesn't

can get away with but having the elbow
up here as opposed to the arm out you

774
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
up here as opposed to the arm out you
 

775
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,029
up here as opposed to the arm out you
got to go way high to get that elbow

776
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:40,039

783
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,669
that way okay so we're now add that to
It

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480

 

811
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,870

it better there you go

812
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880

 

813
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,190

better that's

814
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,200

 

815
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,430

it a lot of people because they have

816
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
it a lot of people because they have
 

817
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,909
it a lot of people because they have
just leverage system or uh which is or

818
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
just leverage system or uh which is or
 

819
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,350
just leverage system or uh which is or
if it's inferior to the UK um they will

820
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,360
if it's inferior to the UK um they will
 

821
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,710
if it's inferior to the UK um they will
never give them anything as I mentioned

822
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
never give them anything as I mentioned
 

823
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,190
never give them anything as I mentioned
earlier okay so they come around like

824
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
earlier okay so they come around like
 

825
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,350
earlier okay so they come around like
this and they stay in front then he

826
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,360
this and they stay in front then he
 

827
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,990
this and they stay in front then he
grabs my arm out there okay now the

828
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,000
grabs my arm out there okay now the
 

829
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,190
grabs my arm out there okay now the
technique doesn't make any sense because

830
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,200
technique doesn't make any sense because
 

831
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,310
technique doesn't make any sense because
um

832
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,320
um
 

833
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,870

so you don't do that you have to bait
 

837

here
 

1291
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,030
here
so you got to not make the

1292
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
so you got to not make the
 

1293
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,230
so you got to not make the
mistake that you're trying to do do like

1294
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
mistake that you're trying to do do like
 

1295
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,510
mistake that you're trying to do do like
a Ura version where you're coming to the

1296
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:00,520
a Ura version where you're coming to the
 

1297
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,470
a Ura version where you're coming to the
back because we're not we're in the

1298
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:03,480
back because we're not we're in the
 

1299
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,750
back because we're not we're in the
front we're going to attack the front

1300
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
front we're going to attack the front
 

1301
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,230
front we're going to attack the front
we're going to do a m okay so as he

1302
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,240
we're going to do a m okay so as he
 

1303
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,829
we're going to do a m okay so as he
comes around you have to watch your

1304
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:12,839
comes around you have to watch your
 

1305
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,750
comes around you have to watch your
because you missed it you

1306
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:16,760
because you missed it you
 

1307
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,870
because you missed it you
see you want him to end boom right

1308
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:21,880
see you want him to end boom right
 

1309
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,870
see you want him to end boom right
there okay so what am I doing I I took

1310
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
there okay so what am I doing I I took
 

1311
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,190
there okay so what am I doing I I took
the arms out a little bit but we'll just

1312
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,200
the arms out a little bit but we'll just
 

1313
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,790
the arms out a little bit but we'll just
get to that last Point

1314
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:32,800
get to that last Point
 

1315
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,750
get to that last Point
okay you're doing that's where the x is

1316
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:36,760
okay you're doing that's where the x is
 

1317
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,109
okay you're doing that's where the x is
okay so you have two

1318
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
okay so you have two
 

1319
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,950
okay so you have two
possibilities

1320
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
possibilities
 

1321
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,870
possibilities
um which gives you your spectrum for the

1322
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
um which gives you your spectrum for the
 

1323
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,870
um which gives you your spectrum for the
Emi one I can take out the dominant leg

1324
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
Emi one I can take out the dominant leg
 

1325
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,030
Emi one I can take out the dominant leg
or two I can project this leg okay

1326
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,040
or two I can project this leg okay
 

1327
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,510
or two I can project this leg okay
okay um

1328
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:00,520
okay um
 

1329
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,829
okay um
into that angle

1330
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
into that angle
 

1331
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,670
into that angle
there usually when you go fast that's

1332
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:06,680
