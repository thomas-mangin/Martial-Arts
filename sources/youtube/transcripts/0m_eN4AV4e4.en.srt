engagement with dichotomy
 

89
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,470
engagement with dichotomy
is to reconcile them

90
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,480
is to reconcile them
 

91
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,570
is to reconcile them
so that in a way they cease functioning

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,580
so that in a way they cease functioning
 

93
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,350
so that in a way they cease functioning
and when they cease functioning

94
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,360
and when they cease functioning
 

95
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,869
and when they cease functioning
the Dao will arise

so another dichotomy we have is your

00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,869
so another dichotomy we have is your
first mind and your second mind or the

environment by going you're not falling

368
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:28,620
environment by going you're not falling
 

369
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,430
environment by going you're not falling
here you're falling over here okay and

370

here you're falling over here okay and
 

371
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,829
here you're falling over here okay and
the way you can tell that is they'll

372
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
the way you can tell that is they'll
 

373
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,070
the way you can tell that is they'll
they'll you'll you'll sense the surprise

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
they'll you'll you'll sense the surprise
 

375
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,350
they'll you'll you'll sense the surprise
in them they'll they'll take an inhale

376

in them they'll they'll take an inhale
 

377
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,329
in them they'll they'll take an inhale
they'll hold their breath their eyes

378
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:41,339
they'll hold their breath their eyes
 

379
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,590
they'll hold their breath their eyes
will bulge they don't fall so well okay

380
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
will bulge they don't fall so well okay
 

381
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,389
will bulge they don't fall so well okay
um and so toward that end I recommend

382
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:47,399
um and so toward that end I recommend
 

383
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,790
um and so toward that end I recommend
that you go slow don't don't go fast

384
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,800
that you go slow don't don't go fast
 

385
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,550
that you go slow don't don't go fast
just train slow speed has nothing to do

386
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
just train slow speed has nothing to do
 

387
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,070
just train slow speed has nothing to do
with the first or the second line aspect

388
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,080
with the first or the second line aspect
 

389
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,949
with the first or the second line aspect
whether we access it or not okay all

390
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:57,959
whether we access it or not okay all
 

391
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,170
whether we access it or not okay all
right so let's try this children

392
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,180

 

393
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,310

do you feel your mind thinking

394
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
do you feel your mind thinking
 

395
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,030
do you feel your mind thinking
recognizing certain things

396
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,040
recognizing certain things
 

397
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,110
recognizing certain things
oh oh this oh that whether it be

398
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120

 

399
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,150

it didn't work or you see that you're

400
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
it didn't work or you see that you're
 

401
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,370
it didn't work or you see that you're
you're identifying this is all first

402
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:22,380
you're identifying this is all first
 

403
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,870
you're identifying this is all first
mine

404
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:23,880
mine
 

405
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,370
mine
these are all ego tripartite okay

406
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,380

 

407
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,030

once you understand the the the the

408
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
once you understand the the the the
 

409
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,829
once you understand the the the the
delusion that kihon

410
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
delusion that kihon
 

411
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,630
delusion that kihon
and you

412
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:35,640
and you
 

413
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,269
and you
the dichotomy there

414
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,279
the dichotomy there
 

415
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,110
the dichotomy there
is no yikyo so there is no non EQ so

416
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
is no yikyo so there is no non EQ so
 

417
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,030
is no yikyo so there is no non EQ so
there's no EQ that didn't happen

418
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040

 

419
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,650

so there's no

420
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:48,660
so there's no
 

421
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,230
so there's no
new thing I have to do

422
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,240
new thing I have to do
 

423
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,509
new thing I have to do
there's no secrets

424
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
there's no secrets
 

425
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,750
there's no secrets
this is followed by that

426
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,760
this is followed by that
 

427
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,569
this is followed by that
but that thinking is not part of it this

428
00:10:59,569 --> 00:10:59,579
but that thinking is not part of it this
 

429
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,850
but that thinking is not part of it this
is first mind training

430
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
is first mind training
 

431
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,829
is first mind training
okay you already know first mine first

432
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
okay you already know first mine first
 

433
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,050
okay you already know first mine first
mind's dominating the world mountains

434
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,060
mind's dominating the world mountains
 

435
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,990
mind's dominating the world mountains
you were raised

436
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,000

441
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,730

it must enter

442
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:16,740
it must enter
 

443
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,290
it must enter
a different state

444
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,300

 

445
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,170

that think he's not part of it so those

446
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,180
that think he's not part of it so those
 

447
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,090
that think he's not part of it so those
thoughts you were told in your zazen

448
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,100
thoughts you were told in your zazen
 

449
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,009
thoughts you were told in your zazen
training and the thoughts are going to

450
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:28,019
training and the thoughts are going to
 

451
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,630
training and the thoughts are going to
be coming in because the first mind is

452
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:29,640
be coming in because the first mind is
 

453
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,850
be coming in because the first mind is
going to keep functioning you see

454
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:31,860
going to keep functioning you see
 

455
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,590
going to keep functioning you see
and what are you told release the

456
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
and what are you told release the
 

457
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,150
and what are you told release the

thought release the thought but here
 

461
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,389
thought release the thought but here
you're not you're trying to use it to

462
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
you're not you're trying to use it to
 

463
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,490
you're not you're trying to use it to
calculate what to do

464
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:40,500
calculate what to do
 

465
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,350
calculate what to do
it doesn't work

466
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,360
it doesn't work
 

467
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,110
it doesn't work
so if you pay attention something is

468
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
so if you pay attention something is
 

469
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,530
so if you pay attention something is
showing up

470
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:48,540

 

471
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,990

the hook is stopping

472
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,000
the hook is stopping
 

473
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,150
the hook is stopping
do you see you stop

474
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,160
do you see you stop
 

475
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,970
do you see you stop
movement stops it's not fluid because

476
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:55,980
movement stops it's not fluid because
 

477
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,670
movement stops it's not fluid because
the mind is not fluid because the first

478
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:58,680
the mind is not fluid because the first
 

479
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,370
the mind is not fluid because the first
mind can never be fluid it's always

480
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,380
mind can never be fluid it's always
 

481
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,150
mind can never be fluid it's always
staccato like

482
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,160

 

483
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,910

as you get feathered or captured then

484
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
as you get feathered or captured then
 

485
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,610
as you get feathered or captured then
you gotta let go then a new one and let

486
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
you gotta let go then a new one and let
 

487
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,650
you gotta let go then a new one and let
go and a new one like it starts and

488
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:12,660
go and a new one like it starts and
 

489
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,690
go and a new one like it starts and
stops and so your movement starts and

490
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:14,700
stops and so your movement starts and
 

491
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,130
stops and so your movement starts and
stops

492
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
stops
 

493
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,430
stops
and so ukia starts and stops you see and

494
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
and so ukia starts and stops you see and
 

495
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,889
and so ukia starts and stops you see and
so there's Great Moments where Luca is

496
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:21,899
so there's Great Moments where Luca is
 

497
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,750
so there's Great Moments where Luca is
just standing there they're not

498
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
just standing there they're not
 

499
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,530
just standing there they're not
continually traversing the mat they're

500
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:27,540
continually traversing the mat they're
 

501
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,410
continually traversing the mat they're
not continually being brought or kept

502
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,420
not continually being brought or kept
 

503
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,170
not continually being brought or kept
into kazushi you see it and again that's

504
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,180
into kazushi you see it and again that's
 

505
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,750
into kazushi you see it and again that's
milking the drill that can't happen in

506
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
milking the drill that can't happen in
 

507
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,590
milking the drill that can't happen in
real life

508
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,600
real life
 

509
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,970
real life
okay

510
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:37,980
okay
 

511
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,310
okay
so

512
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
so
 

513
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,030
so
if you catch yourself thinking

identifying any of those functionings of
 

517
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,530
identifying any of those functionings of
the intellect just release it right away

518
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:48,540
the intellect just release it right away

themselves off balance do you see

570
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
themselves off balance do you see
 

571
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,350
themselves off balance do you see
well now you slow down so there's less

572
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
well now you slow down so there's less
 

573
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,290
well now you slow down so there's less
energy and now Eureka doesn't know where

574
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,300
energy and now Eureka doesn't know where
 

575
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,970
energy and now Eureka doesn't know where
to go so they're not going to take the

576
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:13,980
to go so they're not going to take the
 

577
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,329
to go so they're not going to take the
dive so you have to do a fuller range of

578
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:17,339
dive so you have to do a fuller range of
 

579
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,949

do you understand that so you you would
 

653
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,810
do you understand that so you you would
have to use one of the other pins that

654
00:15:59,810 --> 00:15:59,820
have to use one of the other pins that
 

655

of the keyhone pins because uruka is
 

663
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,189
of the keyhone pins because uruka is
just lying there they they should be

664
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
just lying there they they should be
 

665
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,870
just lying there they they should be
able to keep moving

okay
that is a form of contestation

686
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:39,899
that is a form of contestation
 

687
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,030
that is a form of contestation
what you want to do instead is every

688
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,040
what you want to do instead is every
 

689
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,870
what you want to do instead is every
let's let's give a mathematical

690
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880

 

691
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,350

perspective to it so here's the Lucas

692
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,360
perspective to it so here's the Lucas
 

693
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,430
perspective to it so here's the Lucas
upright posture and they're gonna go to

694
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:58,440
upright posture and they're gonna go to
 

695
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,530
upright posture and they're gonna go to
a 90 okay so every one of these degrees

696
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,540

 

697
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,069

you can start manipulating it as you

698
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,079
you can start manipulating it as you
 

699
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,710
you can start manipulating it as you
move it around into the kazishi pattern

700
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:09,720
move it around into the kazishi pattern
 

701
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,390
move it around into the kazishi pattern
it's either the front inward or the back

702
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,400
it's either the front inward or the back
 

703
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,870
it's either the front inward or the back
outward so to speak okay as opposed to

704
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
outward so to speak okay as opposed to
 

705
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,569
outward so to speak okay as opposed to
you go straight down and now you gotta

706
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:17,579
you go straight down and now you gotta
 

707
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,929
you go straight down and now you gotta
try to accelerate them do you see if you

708
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:20,939
try to accelerate them do you see if you
 

709
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,409
try to accelerate them do you see if you
blend

710
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:23,419
blend
 

711
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,809
blend
incrementally with each one of those you

712
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:26,819
incrementally with each one of those you
 

713
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,970
incrementally with each one of those you
can get the body tilt

714
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:28,980
can get the body tilt
 

715
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,190
can get the body tilt
that takes them into the kazushi

716
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
that takes them into the kazushi
 

717
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,830
that takes them into the kazushi
patterns and you don't have to

718
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
patterns and you don't have to
 

719
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,510
patterns and you don't have to
accelerate them

720
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
accelerate them
 

721
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,830
accelerate them
okay so look for this also this change

722
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
okay so look for this also this change
 

723
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,810
okay so look for this also this change
in your tempo

724
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:41,820
in your tempo
 

725
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,049
in your tempo
okay in your Technique that too is a

726
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:45,059
okay in your Technique that too is a
 

727
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,210
okay in your Technique that too is a
sign that you're functioning from the

728
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
sign that you're functioning from the
 

729
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,090
sign that you're functioning from the
first mind okay because you're you're

730
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,100
first mind okay because you're you're
 

731
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,450
first mind okay because you're you're
you the first mind can't make those

732
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,460
you the first mind can't make those
 

733
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,029
you the first mind can't make those
adjustments like that it cannot function

734
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:56,039
adjustments like that it cannot function
 

735
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,029
adjustments like that it cannot function
at the speed of life it it understands

736
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
at the speed of life it it understands
 

737
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,190
at the speed of life it it understands
beginning middle end that's about it

738
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
beginning middle end that's about it
 

739
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,529
beginning middle end that's about it
okay and really just beginning to end

740
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:03,539
okay and really just beginning to end
 

741
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,830
okay and really just beginning to end
okay so let's try it again and not have

742
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:06,840
okay so let's try it again and not have
 

743
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,210
okay so let's try it again and not have
to speed up

744
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,220
to speed up
 

745
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,390
to speed up
in fact you can go quite slow and still

746
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,400
in fact you can go quite slow and still
 

747
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,510
in fact you can go quite slow and still
keep okay moving still get them in a

748
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,520
keep okay moving still get them in a
 

749
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,810
keep okay moving still get them in a
kazushi without letting them regain all

750
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:17,820
kazushi without letting them regain all
 

751
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,470
kazushi without letting them regain all
that kind of stuff because you just keep

752
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
that kind of stuff because you just keep
 

753
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,870
that kind of stuff because you just keep
adjusting each one of those degrees into

754
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:23,880
adjusting each one of those degrees into
 

755
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,510
adjusting each one of those degrees into
the kazushi patterns okay let's try it

756
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:26,520
the kazushi patterns okay let's try it
 

757
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,010
the kazushi patterns okay let's try it
again

758
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,020

 

759
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,970

so tell me if this is not true

760
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
so tell me if this is not true
 

761
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,549
so tell me if this is not true
when you have only access to the first

762
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
when you have only access to the first

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,730
when you have only access to the first
mind

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,169

the Aikido you do is first mind Ikea

00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:48,179
the Aikido you do is first mind Ikea
 

767
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,830
the Aikido you do is first mind Ikea
the Aikido will not

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
the Aikido will not
 

769
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,350
the Aikido will not
will not give you access to the second

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,360
will not give you access to the second
 

771
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,049
will not give you access to the second
mind

773
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,850

and first mine Aikido is a

774
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:58,860
and first mine Aikido is a
 

775
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,450
and first mine Aikido is a
contradictions oxymoronic

776
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:02,460
contradictions oxymoronic
 

777
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,669
contradictions oxymoronic
there's only really Aikido from the

778
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:04,679
there's only really Aikido from the
 

779
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,850
there's only really Aikido from the
second mind

780
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:07,860

 

781
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,310

so that the techniques are not the

782
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
so that the techniques are not the
 

783
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,590
so that the techniques are not the
vehicle

784
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600

 

785
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,610

for the cessation of the first mind

786
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:19,620
for the cessation of the first mind
 

787
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,850
for the cessation of the first mind
the first time will

788
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:22,860
the first time will
 

789
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,770
the first time will
do what it always does

790
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:27,780

 

791
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,870

it will take the technique and you'll

792
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:29,880
it will take the technique and you'll
 

793
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,390
it will take the technique and you'll
experience it through the first mind you

794
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
experience it through the first mind you
 

795
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,450
experience it through the first mind you
push on what's pushing on you

796
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,460
push on what's pushing on you
 

797
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,730
push on what's pushing on you
you intellectualize you Fetter you stop

798
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:40,740

 

799
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,630

you accelerate you force it does it'll

800
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
you accelerate you force it does it'll
 

801
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:54,470
you accelerate you force it does it'll
never not do that

802
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480

 

803
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,930

something to think about

804
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:56,940
something to think about
 

805
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,270
something to think about
you have let's say you're doing Zen and

806
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
you have let's say you're doing Zen and
 

807
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,110
you have let's say you're doing Zen and
you have zazen

808
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120

 

809
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,570

and in a way zazen is almost like giwaza

810
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:08,580

 

811
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,970

you can't really do zazen until you can

812
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:10,980
you can't really do zazen until you can
 

813
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,570
you can't really do zazen until you can
tap into the second line

814
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:14,580

 

815
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,950

zazen is almost like a spot check

816
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960

 

817
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,669

can you do second mind or not

818
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679

 

819
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,270

were you really cultivated

820
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,280

 

821
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,570

is where Feast is where first mine is

822
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:35,580
is where Feast is where first mine is
 

823
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:43,850
is where Feast is where first mine is
not allowed to function

824
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:43,860

 

825
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,169

so in your regimented day

826
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,179

 

827
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,090

in your strict

828
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,100
in your strict
 

829
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,789
in your strict
Senpai kohai relationship

830
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:55,799

 

831
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,370

in your vowel-based Devotion to the

00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,380
in your vowel-based Devotion to the

835
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,830

in your work

836
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:06,840

 

837
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:16,490

in your dietary prescriptions

838
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,500

 

839
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,870

if you look at the Buddhist Canon

840
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
if you look at the Buddhist Canon
 

841
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,470
if you look at the Buddhist Canon
you have

842
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480

 

843
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,110

the sutras

844
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
the sutras
 

845
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,570
the sutras
the words of the Buddha the teachings of

846
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:29,580
the words of the Buddha the teachings of
 

847
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,390
the words of the Buddha the teachings of
the Buddha

848
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400

 

849
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,210

then you have a philosophical Canon

850
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,220
then you have a philosophical Canon
 

851
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,810
then you have a philosophical Canon
commentaries and things like this

852
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:41,820

 

853
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,610

but then you have

854
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:43,620
but then you have
 

855
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,870
but then you have
a monastic code

856
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880

 

857
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,710

and when you compare the size of them

858
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:51,720
and when you compare the size of them
 

859
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,770
and when you compare the size of them
the Buddha's words the philosophical
