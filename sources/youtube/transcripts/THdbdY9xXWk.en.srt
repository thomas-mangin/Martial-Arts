mistakes that n and we'll we'll do Jon
 

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,030
mistakes that n and we'll we'll do Jon
okay so first mistake is that you're on

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
okay so first mistake is that you're on

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,910
okay so first mistake is that you're on
this uh XY AIS stuff so he's going on

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
this uh XY AIS stuff so he's going on
 

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,269
this uh XY AIS stuff so he's going on
that way and I go that way that's

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:18,279
that way and I go that way that's
 

11
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,349
that way and I go that way that's
incorrect okay so you have to use your

12
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
incorrect okay so you have to use your
 

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,790
incorrect okay so you have to use your
iion to start the fight

14
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
iion to start the fight
 

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,150

but I'm not just getting out of the

20
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
but I'm not just getting out of the
 

21
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,630
but I'm not just getting out of the
way so for example if he's pulling right

22
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,640
way so for example if he's pulling right
 

23
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,549
way so for example if he's pulling right
he's pulling I still am bringing that

24
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
he's pulling I still am bringing that
 

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,110
he's pulling I still am bringing that
fight around with those IDE do you

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120

understand okay so don't just rely on

28
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
understand okay so don't just rely on
 

29
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,150
understand okay so don't just rely on
getting out of the way because you can't

30
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
getting out of the way because you can't
 

31
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,189
getting out of the way because you can't
rotate the fight that way so remember

32
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
rotate the fight that way so remember
 

33
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,950

you're on the outside checking for the

58
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:42,119
you're on the outside checking for the
 

59
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,230
you're on the outside checking for the
turn you don't want him turning and do

60
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
turn you don't want him turning and do
 

61
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,510
turn you don't want him turning and do
take downs and stuff like that so you're

62
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:46,520
take downs and stuff like that so you're
 

63
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,149
take downs and stuff like that so you're
controlling the turn

64
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,159

 

65
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,230

okay here control the turn not over the

66
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
okay here control the turn not over the
 

67
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,830
okay here control the turn not over the
top all right let's get

68
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840

 

69
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,069

there so right now we're antagonistic to

70
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
there so right now we're antagonistic to
 

71
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,830
there so right now we're antagonistic to
each other I'm I'm going this way

he's going that way he doesn't want to

76
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
he's going that way he doesn't want to
 

77
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,150
he's going that way he doesn't want to
go backwards so that's why I rotate the

78
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,160
go backwards so that's why I rotate the
 

79
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,270
go backwards so that's why I rotate the
cross and I get to the back and now we

80
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,280
cross and I get to the back and now we
 

81
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,430
cross and I get to the back and now we
are going in the same direction but I'm

82
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,440
are going in the same direction but I'm
 

83
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,509
are going in the same direction but I'm
in the center of a

generated here it's over here and with
 

131
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,630
generated here it's over here and with
my body so uh here and this iy adhesion

132
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
my body so uh here and this iy adhesion
 

133
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,550
my body so uh here and this iy adhesion
so here is how you control his

134
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,560
so here is how you control his
 

135
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,589
so here is how you control his
body not just his head his body his body

136
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:52,599
body not just his head his body his body
 

137
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,589
body not just his head his body his body
is

138
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
is
 

139
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,789
is
mov so why is that important one you're

140
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
mov so why is that important one you're
 

141
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,869
mov so why is that important one you're
going to need I adhesion skills on this

142
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
going to need I adhesion skills on this
 

143
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,030
going to need I adhesion skills on this
arm because you you don't want to hook

144
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
arm because you you don't want to hook
 

145
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,589
arm because you you don't want to hook
but you have to transfer your connection

146
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
but you have to transfer your connection
 

147
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,630
but you have to transfer your connection
point from the grip to the

148
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
point from the grip to the
 

149
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,030
point from the grip to the
neck here this has to be

150
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
neck here this has to be
 

151
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,710
neck here this has to be
there because that is my kazushi part

152
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
there because that is my kazushi part
 

153
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,469
there because that is my kazushi part
okay the kazushi is generated in the

154
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:17,479
okay the kazushi is generated in the
 

155
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,590
okay the kazushi is generated in the
following way so if I was doing cun Naga

156
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:20,600
following way so if I was doing cun Naga
 

157
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,950
following way so if I was doing cun Naga
it is my weight goes into my

158
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:23,960
it is my weight goes into my
 

159
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,390
it is my weight goes into my
hand same thing like he's trying to hold

160
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
hand same thing like he's trying to hold
 

161
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,990
hand same thing like he's trying to hold
my arm he's trying to pick my arm up

162
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
my arm he's trying to pick my arm up
