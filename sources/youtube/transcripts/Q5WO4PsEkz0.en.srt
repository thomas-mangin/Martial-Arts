their sinner into the tech hi okay so
 

81
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,970
their sinner into the tech hi okay so
I'm coming in like that

82
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:03,980
I'm coming in like that
 

83
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,640
I'm coming in like that
now I have that intention of coming in

that space do you see that you are doing
 

99
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,690
that space do you see that you are doing
that in abstract form but when you do

that in abstract form but when you do
this this is nothing okay so make sure

102
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:42,980
this this is nothing okay so make sure
 

103
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,590
this this is nothing okay so make sure
that your projection is happening from

104
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,600
that your projection is happening from

what I want to call spinal displacement

106
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:50,770
what I want to call spinal displacement
 

107
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,650
what I want to call spinal displacement
her spine is there and I'm moving my

108
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,660
her spine is there and I'm moving my
 

109
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,700
her spine is there and I'm moving my
spine into that spot you get that fake

110
00:03:59,700 --> 00:03:59,710

 

111
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,960

so she goes

112
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:04,970

 

113
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:14,530

[Music]

114
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:14,540

 

115
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,300

now I'm going to reconcile that energy

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,310
now I'm going to reconcile that energy
 

117
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,380
now I'm going to reconcile that energy
okay as you as you watch them she's got

118
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,390
okay as you as you watch them she's got
 

119
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,700
okay as you as you watch them she's got
energy there's going to be a pressure

120
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:25,710
energy there's going to be a pressure
 

121
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,220
energy there's going to be a pressure
buildup right here do you feel that what

122
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,230
buildup right here do you feel that what
 

123
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,170
buildup right here do you feel that what
I'm going to do instead is realize

124
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,180
I'm going to do instead is realize
 

125
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,710
I'm going to do instead is realize
that's happening because I'm resisting

126
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
that's happening because I'm resisting
 

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:42,350
that's happening because I'm resisting
okay so she moves I let it go up not

128
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
okay so she moves I let it go up not
 

129
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:53,420
okay so she moves I let it go up not
after then I go not before and not more

130
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,430
after then I go not before and not more
 

131
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:37,060
after then I go not before and not more
that is necessary do you see so just

132
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,070

 

133
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:44,770

so there's no contention just let's work

134
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:44,780
so there's no contention just let's work
 

135
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:54,280
so there's no contention just let's work
up I get rid of that contention let's

136
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,290
up I get rid of that contention let's
 

137
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,590
up I get rid of that contention let's
try that

138
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
try that
 

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,140
try that
okay so remember we kissed

role is as prescribed so the
 

143
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,600
role is as prescribed so the
prescription was to displace right but

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,610
prescription was to displace right but
 

145
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,570
prescription was to displace right but
with this attack get it

146
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,580
with this attack get it
 

147
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,410
with this attack get it
not with this attack

attack okay
 

153
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,990
attack okay
all of those are as goofy as the last

154
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
all of those are as goofy as the last
 

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,420
all of those are as goofy as the last
one because you were asked to do a

156
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,430
one because you were asked to do a
 

157
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,690
one because you were asked to do a
certain thing and you didn't do it so

158
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:39,700
certain thing and you didn't do it so
 

159
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,520
certain thing and you didn't do it so
when you come in and I push and you

160
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,530
when you come in and I push and you
 

161
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,020
when you come in and I push and you
start to go like that you see that you

162
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,030
start to go like that you see that you
 

163
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,180
start to go like that you see that you
can only do that because you stop

164
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,190
can only do that because you stop
 

165
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,270
can only do that because you stop
