00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,950

hi i'm christopher hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
hi i'm christopher hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,349
hi i'm christopher hine and today we're
going to be talking about basic sword

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
going to be talking about basic sword
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,670
going to be talking about basic sword
theory so um

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
theory so um
 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,430
theory so um
this stuff generally tends to get in the

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
this stuff generally tends to get in the
 

9
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,910
this stuff generally tends to get in the
way a lot of the practice and so there's

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
way a lot of the practice and so there's
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
way a lot of the practice and so there's
there's a lot of you know real theorists

12
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
there's a lot of you know real theorists
 

13
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,190
there's a lot of you know real theorists
out there

14
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
out there
 

15
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,710
out there
so i'm going to try to outline some

16
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
so i'm going to try to outline some
 

17
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,029
so i'm going to try to outline some
theory for you guys that's really basic

18
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
theory for you guys that's really basic
 

19
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,470
theory for you guys that's really basic
and common sense and should help clarify

20
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
and common sense and should help clarify
 

21
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,390
and common sense and should help clarify
a lot of the stuff you see people doing

22
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
a lot of the stuff you see people doing
 

23
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,589
a lot of the stuff you see people doing
with swords

24
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
with swords
 

25
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,589
with swords
and this stuff comes from a bunch of

26
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
and this stuff comes from a bunch of
 

27
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,109
and this stuff comes from a bunch of
historical research i've done and then

28
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
historical research i've done and then
 

29
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,950
historical research i've done and then
also practical experience

30
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
also practical experience
 

31
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,229
also practical experience
doing a lot of sword sparring and

32
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
doing a lot of sword sparring and
 

33
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,830
doing a lot of sword sparring and
playing with swords so i'm going to give

34
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
playing with swords so i'm going to give
 

35
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,470
playing with swords so i'm going to give
you some basic outlines of important

36
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
you some basic outlines of important
 

37
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,910
you some basic outlines of important
things you need to think about and

38
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
things you need to think about and
 

39
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,869
things you need to think about and
what's happening in sword fighting so

40
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
what's happening in sword fighting so
 

41
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,910
what's happening in sword fighting so
i'm going to get josh out here we're

42
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
i'm going to get josh out here we're
 

43
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,110
i'm going to get josh out here we're
going to go to work josh

44
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
going to go to work josh
 

45
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,389
going to go to work josh
all right so let's talk about basic

46
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
all right so let's talk about basic
 

47
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,670
all right so let's talk about basic
sword theory

48
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
sword theory
 

49
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,670
sword theory
and i'm not going to load you down with

50
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
and i'm not going to load you down with
 

51
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,830
and i'm not going to load you down with
a bunch of weird historical references

52
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
a bunch of weird historical references
 

53
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,350
a bunch of weird historical references
or give you any kind of dogmatic

54
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
or give you any kind of dogmatic
 

55
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,110
or give you any kind of dogmatic
approach i'm basically just going to

56
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
approach i'm basically just going to
 

57
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,670
approach i'm basically just going to
explain how i think about sword fighting

58
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
explain how i think about sword fighting
 

59
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,069
explain how i think about sword fighting
or honestly any kind of weapon on weapon

60
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
or honestly any kind of weapon on weapon
 

61
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,510
or honestly any kind of weapon on weapon
situation

62
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
situation
 

63
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,349
situation
and and what's going on with that and i

64
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
and and what's going on with that and i
 

65
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,030
and and what's going on with that and i
think i can make it real simple for you

66
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
think i can make it real simple for you
 

67
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,070
think i can make it real simple for you
all right so

68
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
all right so
 

69
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,429
all right so
when you're fighting another person with

70
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
when you're fighting another person with
 

71
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,710
when you're fighting another person with
a weapon so we're having some kind of

72
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
a weapon so we're having some kind of
 

73
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,469
a weapon so we're having some kind of
dueling situation even if it's for a

74
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
dueling situation even if it's for a
 

75
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,230
dueling situation even if it's for a
split second so remember aikido is not

76
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
split second so remember aikido is not
 

77
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,230
split second so remember aikido is not
about a dueling situation it's about

78
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
about a dueling situation it's about
 

79
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,670
about a dueling situation it's about
some kind of situation where i

80
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
some kind of situation where i
 

81
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,429
some kind of situation where i
preferably just like to not be there or

82
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
preferably just like to not be there or
 

83
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,950
preferably just like to not be there or
not dealing with this guy or de-escalate

84
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
not dealing with this guy or de-escalate
 

85
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,789
not dealing with this guy or de-escalate
in some kind of way that's what i want

86
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
in some kind of way that's what i want
 

87
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,710
in some kind of way that's what i want
but we're in a dueling situation at

88
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
but we're in a dueling situation at
 

89
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,630
but we're in a dueling situation at
least for a split second what's

90
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
least for a split second what's
 

91
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,310
least for a split second what's
happening in that dueling situation all

92
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
happening in that dueling situation all
 

93
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,830
happening in that dueling situation all
right now if josh is just on guard here

94
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
right now if josh is just on guard here
 

95
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,469
right now if josh is just on guard here
okay and i just say i want to hit him

96
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
okay and i just say i want to hit him
 

97
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,990
okay and i just say i want to hit him
that's it right my only thought is i

98
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
that's it right my only thought is i
 

99
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,069
that's it right my only thought is i
want to hit him if i just came in like

100
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
want to hit him if i just came in like
 

101
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,950
want to hit him if i just came in like
this he's going to hit me in return

102
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
this he's going to hit me in return
 

103
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,670
this he's going to hit me in return
right so that's my inherent first

104
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
right so that's my inherent first
 

105
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,230
right so that's my inherent first
problem is i come in there and i get

106
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
problem is i come in there and i get
 

107
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,670
problem is i come in there and i get
this guy and he's going to get me in

108
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
this guy and he's going to get me in
 

109
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,590
this guy and he's going to get me in
return right so if this guy does not

110
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
return right so if this guy does not
 

111
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,109
return right so if this guy does not
care about himself that's what he's

112
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
care about himself that's what he's
 

113
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,310
care about himself that's what he's
going to do

114
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
going to do
 

115
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,510
going to do
okay now that is also always balanced by

116
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
okay now that is also always balanced by
 

117
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,469
okay now that is also always balanced by
the fact

118
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
the fact
 

119
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,429
the fact
that i can make the assumption generally

120
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
that i can make the assumption generally
 

121
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,510
that i can make the assumption generally
that he's more interested in protecting

122
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
that he's more interested in protecting
 

123
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,990
that he's more interested in protecting
himself than he is and hurting me now i

124
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
himself than he is and hurting me now i
 

125
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,069
himself than he is and hurting me now i
i'm sure he's interested in hurting me

126
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
i'm sure he's interested in hurting me
 

127
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,190
i'm sure he's interested in hurting me
but secondary to protecting himself so i

128
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
but secondary to protecting himself so i
 

129
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,229
but secondary to protecting himself so i
often can get away with attacking on

130
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
often can get away with attacking on
 

131
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,710
often can get away with attacking on
this line because he's probably going to

132
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
this line because he's probably going to
 

133
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,350
this line because he's probably going to
remove his weapon to defend himself

134
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
remove his weapon to defend himself
 

135
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,350
remove his weapon to defend himself
right so so that kind of thing happens

136
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
right so so that kind of thing happens
 

137
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,390
right so so that kind of thing happens
all right now

138
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
all right now
 

139
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,190
all right now
both of those situations for me as a

140
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
both of those situations for me as a
 

141
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,670
both of those situations for me as a
weapon user against this guy are bad

142
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
weapon user against this guy are bad
 

143
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,550
weapon user against this guy are bad
situations one i get hurt in so that's

144
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
situations one i get hurt in so that's
 

145
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,470
situations one i get hurt in so that's
no good for me and two i have an

146
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
no good for me and two i have an
 

147
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,110
no good for me and two i have an
unsuccessful attack because he owns the

148
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
unsuccessful attack because he owns the
 

149
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,869
unsuccessful attack because he owns the
center line right so like right now he

150
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
center line right so like right now he
 

151
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,030
center line right so like right now he
owns i own mine too but he owns his over

152
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
owns i own mine too but he owns his over
 

153
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,110
owns i own mine too but he owns his over
in his space so it means if i attempt to

154
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
in his space so it means if i attempt to
 

155
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,949
in his space so it means if i attempt to
attack in there he's either going to hit

156
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
attack in there he's either going to hit
 

157
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,670
attack in there he's either going to hit
me

158
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
me
 

159
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,589
me
or he's going to defend what i'm

160
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
or he's going to defend what i'm
 

161
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,509
or he's going to defend what i'm
throwing my shot into so i don't want

162
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
throwing my shot into so i don't want
 

163
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,430
throwing my shot into so i don't want
either one of those two things to happen

164
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
either one of those two things to happen
 

165
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,270
either one of those two things to happen
so i'm always going to find a way to

166
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
so i'm always going to find a way to
 

167
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,670
so i'm always going to find a way to
attack him that doesn't involve that so

168
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
attack him that doesn't involve that so
 

169
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,430
attack him that doesn't involve that so
i want to find some kind of awesome way

170
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
i want to find some kind of awesome way
 

171
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,190
i want to find some kind of awesome way
to attack him that doesn't involve that

172
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
to attack him that doesn't involve that
 

173
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,670
to attack him that doesn't involve that
so what can i do well i could either

174
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
so what can i do well i could either
 

175
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,589
so what can i do well i could either
wait for him to do something right so he

176
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
wait for him to do something right so he
 

177
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,790
wait for him to do something right so he
could like wind up his sword or

178
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
could like wind up his sword or
 

179
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,550
could like wind up his sword or
something ah now his swords over there

180
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
something ah now his swords over there
 

181
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,790
something ah now his swords over there
this might be an ideal time to attack

182
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
this might be an ideal time to attack
 

183
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,670
this might be an ideal time to attack
okay i could move myself to a better

184
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
okay i could move myself to a better
 

185
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,430
okay i could move myself to a better
place so if i moved over here and he

186
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
place so if i moved over here and he
 

187
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,430
place so if i moved over here and he
didn't move his defense over here then

188
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
didn't move his defense over here then
 

189
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,110
didn't move his defense over here then
this is good this is the kind of kind of

190
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
this is good this is the kind of kind of
 

191
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,750
this is good this is the kind of kind of
way i could attack him or i could remove

192
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
way i could attack him or i could remove
 

193
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,910
way i could attack him or i could remove
whatever is defending him from the space

194
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
whatever is defending him from the space
 

195
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,750
whatever is defending him from the space
right so i can somehow move that out

196
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
right so i can somehow move that out
 

197
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,190
right so i can somehow move that out
these are the basic ways i'm going to

198
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
these are the basic ways i'm going to
 

199
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,869
these are the basic ways i'm going to
set up my initial attack and if i'm

200
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
set up my initial attack and if i'm
 

201
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,869
set up my initial attack and if i'm
doing anything with my initial attack

202
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
doing anything with my initial attack
 

203
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,869
doing anything with my initial attack
other than some some way to break down

204
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
other than some some way to break down
 

205
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,910
other than some some way to break down
his defenses i'm not doing my job okay

206
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
his defenses i'm not doing my job okay
 

207
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,750
his defenses i'm not doing my job okay
now there's all kinds of things i could

208
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
now there's all kinds of things i could
 

209
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,270
now there's all kinds of things i could
shout at this guy or kick dirt in his

210
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
shout at this guy or kick dirt in his
 

211
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,030
shout at this guy or kick dirt in his
face who knows there's all kinds of ways

212
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
face who knows there's all kinds of ways
 

213
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,789
face who knows there's all kinds of ways
i could possibly do it but in general

214
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
i could possibly do it but in general
 

215
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,470
i could possibly do it but in general
i'm going to break it down to either i'm

216
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
i'm going to break it down to either i'm
 

217
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,630
i'm going to break it down to either i'm
going to change the the line

218
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
going to change the the line
 

219
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,030
going to change the the line
i'm going to remove his weapon myself or

220
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
i'm going to remove his weapon myself or
 

221
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,630
i'm going to remove his weapon myself or
i'm going to wait for him to remove his

222
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
i'm going to wait for him to remove his
 

223
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,990
i'm going to wait for him to remove his
weapon and that's when i'm going to

224
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
weapon and that's when i'm going to
 

225
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,830
weapon and that's when i'm going to
attack so those are the moments that i'm

226
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
attack so those are the moments that i'm
 

227
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,509
attack so those are the moments that i'm
looking to attack right so that's that's

228
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
looking to attack right so that's that's
 

229
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,190
looking to attack right so that's that's
what i'm looking for all right now

230
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
what i'm looking for all right now
 

231
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,070
what i'm looking for all right now
inherently every time i attack this guy

232
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
inherently every time i attack this guy
 

233
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,750
inherently every time i attack this guy
there's the possibility he's gonna

234
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
there's the possibility he's gonna
 

235
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,350
there's the possibility he's gonna
attack me back if we have similar

236
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
attack me back if we have similar
 

237
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,350
attack me back if we have similar
weapons so right now we have

238
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
weapons so right now we have
 

239
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,869
weapons so right now we have
the same weapon right so the same basic

240
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
the same weapon right so the same basic
 

241
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,630
the same weapon right so the same basic
length weapon we're about the same size

242
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
length weapon we're about the same size
 

243
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,110
length weapon we're about the same size
so this means whenever i touch josh he

244
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
so this means whenever i touch josh he
 

245
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,869
so this means whenever i touch josh he
can touch me back right he can always

246
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
can touch me back right he can always
 

247
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,710
can touch me back right he can always
touch me back when i'm touching him so

248
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
touch me back when i'm touching him so
 

249
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,270
touch me back when i'm touching him so
that means that if he has at least a

250
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
that means that if he has at least a
 

251
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,830
that means that if he has at least a
split second before he dies or gets

252
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
split second before he dies or gets
 

253
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,429
split second before he dies or gets
blown away or cut in half or whatever i

254
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
blown away or cut in half or whatever i
 

255
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,710
blown away or cut in half or whatever i
do he's going to return shot on me

256
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
do he's going to return shot on me
 

257
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,349
do he's going to return shot on me
so that means every time i attack him

258
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
so that means every time i attack him
 

259
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,310
so that means every time i attack him
i'm also planning my defense in the

260
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
i'm also planning my defense in the
 

261
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,230
i'm also planning my defense in the
attack and if i'm not doing that then

262
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
attack and if i'm not doing that then
 

263
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,990
attack and if i'm not doing that then
i'm not preserving myself when i'm

264
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
i'm not preserving myself when i'm
 

265
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,430
i'm not preserving myself when i'm
attacking him so it means i have to

266
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
attacking him so it means i have to
 

267
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,950
attacking him so it means i have to
figure out some clever way that i'm

268
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
figure out some clever way that i'm
 

269
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,870
figure out some clever way that i'm
going to defend whatever it is he throws

270
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
going to defend whatever it is he throws
 

271
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,350
going to defend whatever it is he throws
next after i attack that doesn't mean

272
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
next after i attack that doesn't mean
 

273
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,550
next after i attack that doesn't mean
he's going to throw it just means that

274
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
he's going to throw it just means that
 

275
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,390
he's going to throw it just means that
i've got to be prepared for it there are

276
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
i've got to be prepared for it there are
 

277
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,270
i've got to be prepared for it there are
two major ways i'm going to do that one

278
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
two major ways i'm going to do that one
 

279
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,510
two major ways i'm going to do that one
is i'm going to try and land a shot that

280
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
is i'm going to try and land a shot that
 

281
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,270
is i'm going to try and land a shot that
is distanced in such a way that he

282
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
is distanced in such a way that he
 

283
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,909
is distanced in such a way that he
doesn't have an easy return to attack so

284
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
doesn't have an easy return to attack so
 

285
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,310
doesn't have an easy return to attack so
for example if i come out to a line like

286
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
for example if i come out to a line like
 

287
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,790
for example if i come out to a line like
this if he goes high to my head you see

288
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
this if he goes high to my head you see
 

289
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,629
this if he goes high to my head you see
my sword's in the way if he goes low to

290
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
my sword's in the way if he goes low to
 

291
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,629
my sword's in the way if he goes low to
my body the angle i've chosen is

292
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
my body the angle i've chosen is
 

293
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,030
my body the angle i've chosen is
protecting me from his sword so i can

294
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
protecting me from his sword so i can
 

295
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,270
protecting me from his sword so i can
distance myself use an angle to attack

296
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
distance myself use an angle to attack
 

297
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,270
distance myself use an angle to attack
in such a way that he can't immediately

298
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
in such a way that he can't immediately
 

299
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,749
in such a way that he can't immediately
easily return attack we're going to get

300
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
easily return attack we're going to get
 

301
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,749
easily return attack we're going to get
to what easily return attack means in a

302
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
to what easily return attack means in a
 

303
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,189
to what easily return attack means in a
second but that's one of the ways i'm

304
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
second but that's one of the ways i'm
 

305
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,310
second but that's one of the ways i'm
going to do it is i'm going to make an

306
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
going to do it is i'm going to make an
 

307
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,670
going to do it is i'm going to make an
angle in order to do that

308
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
angle in order to do that
 

309
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,790
angle in order to do that
okay so

310
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
okay so
 

311
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,629
okay so
other than distancing another tool i'm

312
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
other than distancing another tool i'm
 

313
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,710
other than distancing another tool i'm
going to use a lot is opposition and

314
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
going to use a lot is opposition and
 

315
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,950
going to use a lot is opposition and
opposition means that whenever i make an

316
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
opposition means that whenever i make an
 

317
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,469
opposition means that whenever i make an
attack my sword is immediately ready to

318
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
attack my sword is immediately ready to
 

319
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,550
attack my sword is immediately ready to
go into a defensive action

320
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
go into a defensive action
 

321
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,150
go into a defensive action
ideally i would like to always use my

322
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
ideally i would like to always use my
 

323
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,590
ideally i would like to always use my
sword in a way that it's already in a

324
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
sword in a way that it's already in a
 

325
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,870
sword in a way that it's already in a
defended action let me show you what i

326
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
defended action let me show you what i
 

327
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,469
defended action let me show you what i
mean with that with a thrust when i

328
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
mean with that with a thrust when i
 

329
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,469
mean with that with a thrust when i
drive my sword in with a thrust my

330
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
drive my sword in with a thrust my
 

331
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,310
drive my sword in with a thrust my
sword's already in contact with his

332
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
sword's already in contact with his
 

333
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,070
sword's already in contact with his
which means whatever he does with his

334
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
which means whatever he does with his
 

335
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,230
which means whatever he does with his
sword my sword can stick to it and gives

336
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
sword my sword can stick to it and gives
 

337
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,550
sword my sword can stick to it and gives
me instant opposition it can oppose his

338
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
me instant opposition it can oppose his
 

339
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,070
me instant opposition it can oppose his
sword

340
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
sword
 

341
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,749
sword
another real simple example of that is

342
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
another real simple example of that is
 

343
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,749
another real simple example of that is
if i was on this angular line here that

344
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
if i was on this angular line here that
 

345
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,590
if i was on this angular line here that
i was on before here and i'm at the

346
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
i was on before here and i'm at the
 

347
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,950
i was on before here and i'm at the
wrong distance so right now you can see

348
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
wrong distance so right now you can see
 

349
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,150
wrong distance so right now you can see
if he brings it in i'm at the wrong

350
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
if he brings it in i'm at the wrong
 

351
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,029
if he brings it in i'm at the wrong
distance okay however my action with the

352
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
distance okay however my action with the
 

353
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,830
distance okay however my action with the
sword is in the defense so notice that

354
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
sword is in the defense so notice that
 

355
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,830
sword is in the defense so notice that
as i'm hitting him my sword's driving

356
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
as i'm hitting him my sword's driving
 

357
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,670
as i'm hitting him my sword's driving
through to defend myself now even if i

358
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
through to defend myself now even if i
 

359
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,189
through to defend myself now even if i
if i went through his head cool that'd

360
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
if i went through his head cool that'd
 

361
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,790
if i went through his head cool that'd
be good so i cut him in half and he's

362
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
be good so i cut him in half and he's
 

363
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,309
be good so i cut him in half and he's
got enough brain power to attack me one

364
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
got enough brain power to attack me one
 

365
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,830
got enough brain power to attack me one
more time then i'm still going to get

366
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
more time then i'm still going to get
 

367
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,230
more time then i'm still going to get
through here but even if he doesn't i

368
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
through here but even if he doesn't i
 

369
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,070
through here but even if he doesn't i
don't drive through him my sword can

370
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
don't drive through him my sword can
 

371
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,590
don't drive through him my sword can
still be brought down to defend myself

372
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
still be brought down to defend myself
 

373
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,510
still be brought down to defend myself
so i always want to put my sword in a

374
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
so i always want to put my sword in a
 

375
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,749
so i always want to put my sword in a
position that it can defend me right

376
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
position that it can defend me right
 

377
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,510
position that it can defend me right
after so that means i wouldn't make

378
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
after so that means i wouldn't make
 

379
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,430
after so that means i wouldn't make
attacks like this for example okay i

380
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
attacks like this for example okay i
 

381
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,950
attacks like this for example okay i
wouldn't attack here now the reason is

382
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
wouldn't attack here now the reason is
 

383
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,710
wouldn't attack here now the reason is
if he goes to attack me

384
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
if he goes to attack me
 

385
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,870
if he goes to attack me
i can't easily bring my sword down here

386
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
i can't easily bring my sword down here
 

387
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,950
i can't easily bring my sword down here
to defend myself right because my body

388
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
to defend myself right because my body
 

389
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,629
to defend myself right because my body
is facing this way which means to defend

390
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
is facing this way which means to defend
 

391
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,629
is facing this way which means to defend
myself i gotta really turn it around

392
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
myself i gotta really turn it around
 

393
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,309
myself i gotta really turn it around
okay and we're gonna get to in one

394
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
okay and we're gonna get to in one
 

395
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,909
okay and we're gonna get to in one
second a really important thing as to

396
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
second a really important thing as to
 

397
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,670
second a really important thing as to
why that's really not practical at all

398
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
why that's really not practical at all
 

399
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,110
why that's really not practical at all
but just understand here this is a

400
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
but just understand here this is a
 

401
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,629
but just understand here this is a
difficult position for me to get around

402
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
difficult position for me to get around
 

403
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,150
difficult position for me to get around
to defend myself if i was going to

404
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
to defend myself if i was going to
 

405
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,309
to defend myself if i was going to
attack him on this line i would turn my

406
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
attack him on this line i would turn my
 

407
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,990
attack him on this line i would turn my
body this way now you see my sword

408
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
body this way now you see my sword
 

409
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,550
body this way now you see my sword
naturally cuts down so if i'm here i

410
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
naturally cuts down so if i'm here i
 

411
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,150
naturally cuts down so if i'm here i
wouldn't attack him this way hard to

412
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
wouldn't attack him this way hard to
 

413
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,230
wouldn't attack him this way hard to
defend what he's going to do next but if

414
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
defend what he's going to do next but if
 

415
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,629
defend what he's going to do next but if
i attack this way see i instantly have

416
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
i attack this way see i instantly have
 

417
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,270
i attack this way see i instantly have
that defense so i always want to when

418
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
that defense so i always want to when
 

419
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,510
that defense so i always want to when
making an attack have opposition

420
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
making an attack have opposition
 

421
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,870
making an attack have opposition
available to me which means i can bring

422
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
available to me which means i can bring
 

423
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,790
available to me which means i can bring
the sword in to defend myself right

424
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
the sword in to defend myself right
 

425
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,230
the sword in to defend myself right
after i attack because he's still going

426
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
after i attack because he's still going
 

427
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,830
after i attack because he's still going
to get an action i don't hit him with

428
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
to get an action i don't hit him with
 

429
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,350
to get an action i don't hit him with
the sword and he instantly dies probably

430
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
the sword and he instantly dies probably
 

431
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,150
the sword and he instantly dies probably
not usually anyways okay now

432
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
not usually anyways okay now
 

433
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,510
not usually anyways okay now
another important thing and i've talked

434
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
another important thing and i've talked
 

435
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,870
another important thing and i've talked
about this but this cannot be talked

436
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
about this but this cannot be talked
 

437
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,990
about this but this cannot be talked
about enough

438
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
about enough
 

439
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,710
about enough
is

440
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
is
 

441
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,270
is
always assume that he's at least going

442
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
always assume that he's at least going
 

443
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,670
always assume that he's at least going
to get an action for every action you

444
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
to get an action for every action you
 

445
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,670
to get an action for every action you
make and those actions are going to be

446
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
make and those actions are going to be
 

447
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,070
make and those actions are going to be
equal and this is what i mean if i get

448
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
equal and this is what i mean if i get
 

449
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,309
equal and this is what i mean if i get
to move my arm for an action like this

450
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
to move my arm for an action like this
 

451
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,230
to move my arm for an action like this
josh gets to move his arm for an action

452
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
josh gets to move his arm for an action
 

453
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,150
josh gets to move his arm for an action
okay so if he's paying attention equally

454
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
okay so if he's paying attention equally
 

455
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,150
okay so if he's paying attention equally
to what i'm doing we're both on the ball

456
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
to what i'm doing we're both on the ball
 

457
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,390
to what i'm doing we're both on the ball
if i move my arms josh can move his arms

458
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
if i move my arms josh can move his arms
 

459
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,710
if i move my arms josh can move his arms
right so if my idea was to somehow sneak

460
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
right so if my idea was to somehow sneak
 

461
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,790
right so if my idea was to somehow sneak
over here and get a high shot on josh he

462
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
over here and get a high shot on josh he
 

463
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,469
over here and get a high shot on josh he
can move his arms to get that same

464
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
can move his arms to get that same
 

465
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,309
can move his arms to get that same
defense okay now arms move very very

466
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
defense okay now arms move very very
 

467
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,390
defense okay now arms move very very
fast which means moving in here to

468
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
fast which means moving in here to
 

469
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,309
fast which means moving in here to
something like this is dangerous because

470
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
something like this is dangerous because
 

471
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,790
something like this is dangerous because
his arms are all that's needed to hit my

472
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
his arms are all that's needed to hit my
 

473
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,950
his arms are all that's needed to hit my
body there right real simple body action

474
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
body there right real simple body action
 

475
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,270
body there right real simple body action
all right now if i can give myself a

476
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
all right now if i can give myself a
 

477
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,110
all right now if i can give myself a
little more distancing okay and due to

478
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
little more distancing okay and due to
 

479
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,869
little more distancing okay and due to
the angles that i've taken here now his

480
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
the angles that i've taken here now his
 

481
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,110
the angles that i've taken here now his
arms can't traverse that distance so he

482
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
arms can't traverse that distance so he
 

483
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,670
arms can't traverse that distance so he
can't make it with his arms but he still

484
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
can't make it with his arms but he still
 

485
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,430
can't make it with his arms but he still
could make it with his body if he leans

486
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
could make it with his body if he leans
 

487
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,350
could make it with his body if he leans
forward with his foot there but there he

488
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
forward with his foot there but there he
 

489
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,629
forward with his foot there but there he
does it with his body okay so let's look

490
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
does it with his body okay so let's look
 

491
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,710
does it with his body okay so let's look
at that again he comes in bang he's

492
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
at that again he comes in bang he's
 

493
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,390
at that again he comes in bang he's
easily able to whack so he can come in

494
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
easily able to whack so he can come in
 

495
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,909
easily able to whack so he can come in
here and you see he can hit my body in

496
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
here and you see he can hit my body in
 

497
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,230
here and you see he can hit my body in
there right so all he's doing is having

498
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
there right so all he's doing is having
 

499
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,230
there right so all he's doing is having
to lean forward just a little bit and he

500
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
to lean forward just a little bit and he
 

501
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,710
to lean forward just a little bit and he
does that but because we're action for

502
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
does that but because we're action for
 

503
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,710
does that but because we're action for
action when he moves his body in i can

504
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
action when he moves his body in i can
 

505
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,950
action when he moves his body in i can
move my body out so remember again

506
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
move my body out so remember again
 

507
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,270
move my body out so remember again
action for action if he moves his body i

508
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
action for action if he moves his body i
 

509
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,350
action for action if he moves his body i
get to move my body if i move my body he

510
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
get to move my body if i move my body he
 

511
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,430
get to move my body if i move my body he
gets to move his body the same is true

512
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
gets to move his body the same is true
 

513
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,070
gets to move his body the same is true
of feet and feet are the slowest meaning

514
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
of feet and feet are the slowest meaning
 

515
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,310
of feet and feet are the slowest meaning
that if i'm coming to attack this guy

516
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
that if i'm coming to attack this guy
 

517
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,029
that if i'm coming to attack this guy
every time i step he's going to also

518
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
every time i step he's going to also
 

519
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,870
every time i step he's going to also
have the opportunity to step so if i

520
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
have the opportunity to step so if i
 

521
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,310
have the opportunity to step so if i
come in at that angle and he sees me

522
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
come in at that angle and he sees me
 

523
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,550
come in at that angle and he sees me
take a step he can always just step out

524
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
take a step he can always just step out
 

525
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,829
take a step he can always just step out
of the way of that angle i'm making

526
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
of the way of that angle i'm making
 

527
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,829
of the way of that angle i'm making
right so i step in to get him he can

528
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
right so i step in to get him he can
 

529
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,949
right so i step in to get him he can
always step out so this is always the

530
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
always step out so this is always the
 

531
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,269
always step out so this is always the
trade that you need to understand assume

532
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
trade that you need to understand assume
 

533
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,590
trade that you need to understand assume
he's at least as capable as you are he's

534
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
he's at least as capable as you are he's
 

535
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,110
he's at least as capable as you are he's
paying as much attention as you are and

536
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
paying as much attention as you are and
 

537
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,230
paying as much attention as you are and
is roughly as skilled as fast or has as

538
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
is roughly as skilled as fast or has as
 

539
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,389
is roughly as skilled as fast or has as
much uh physical ability as you do and

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
much uh physical ability as you do and

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,190
much uh physical ability as you do and
then in that say if i make a hand action

542
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
then in that say if i make a hand action
 

543
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,870
then in that say if i make a hand action
he gets to make a hand action if i make

544
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
he gets to make a hand action if i make
 

545
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
he gets to make a hand action if i make
a body action he gets to make body

546
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
a body action he gets to make body
 

547
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,269
a body action he gets to make body
action and foot for foot now if i can

548
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
action and foot for foot now if i can
 

549
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,350
action and foot for foot now if i can
skew those timings in such a way to help

550
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
skew those timings in such a way to help
 

551
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,590
skew those timings in such a way to help
me meaning he would have to take a

552
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
me meaning he would have to take a
 

553
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,150
me meaning he would have to take a
footstep for my hand action i'm in a

554
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
footstep for my hand action i'm in a
 

555
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,150
footstep for my hand action i'm in a
winning position the same is true though

556
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
winning position the same is true though
 

557
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,550
winning position the same is true though
for him if i'm attacking so if i attack

558
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
for him if i'm attacking so if i attack
 

559
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,710
for him if i'm attacking so if i attack
this guy and the only way to get out of

560
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
this guy and the only way to get out of
 

561
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,470
this guy and the only way to get out of
there is to take a step when he comes to

562
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
there is to take a step when he comes to
 

563
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
there is to take a step when he comes to
attack me he's going to get me every

564
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
attack me he's going to get me every
 

565
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,829
attack me he's going to get me every
time because all he has to do is move

566
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
time because all he has to do is move
 

567
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,590
time because all he has to do is move
his arms the fastest moving thing and i

568
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
his arms the fastest moving thing and i
 

569
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,190
his arms the fastest moving thing and i
got to move my feet the slowest moving

570
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
got to move my feet the slowest moving
 

571
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,870
got to move my feet the slowest moving
thing he's going to get me every time

572
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
thing he's going to get me every time
 

573
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,949
thing he's going to get me every time
now when we're doing stop start action

574
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
now when we're doing stop start action
 

575
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,949
now when we're doing stop start action
or or learning a form or something

576
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
or or learning a form or something
 

577
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,230
or or learning a form or something
that's not true because everything's

578
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
that's not true because everything's
 

579
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,590
that's not true because everything's
broken up in time and so you don't

580
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
broken up in time and so you don't
 

581
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,990
broken up in time and so you don't
inherently get those ideas that those

582
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
inherently get those ideas that those
 

583
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,150

okay now advanced swordsmanship gets

586
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
okay now advanced swordsmanship gets
 

587
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,710
okay now advanced swordsmanship gets
into the ideas of like how to trick his

588
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
into the ideas of like how to trick his
 

589
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,110
into the ideas of like how to trick his
mind how to play with his uh ideas of

590
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
mind how to play with his uh ideas of
 

591
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,870
mind how to play with his uh ideas of
what's going on how to trick him into

592
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
what's going on how to trick him into
 

593
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,710
what's going on how to trick him into
distances so all these are really useful

594
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
distances so all these are really useful
 

595
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,870
distances so all these are really useful
tools but basic swordsmanship you just

596
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
tools but basic swordsmanship you just
 

597
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,110
tools but basic swordsmanship you just
need to understand these ideas right and

598
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
need to understand these ideas right and
 

599
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,430
need to understand these ideas right and
it's that if i'm attacking him i need to

600
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
it's that if i'm attacking him i need to
 

601
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,710
it's that if i'm attacking him i need to
attack in a way that he doesn't

602
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
attack in a way that he doesn't
 

603
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,550
attack in a way that he doesn't
inherently defend because the worst

604
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
inherently defend because the worst
 

605
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,230
inherently defend because the worst
thing that would happen is i die for

606
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
thing that would happen is i die for
 

607
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,829
thing that would happen is i die for
that right so if we're here and i just

608
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
that right so if we're here and i just
 

609
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,269
that right so if we're here and i just
march in on the line worst thing is i

610
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
march in on the line worst thing is i
 

611
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,509
march in on the line worst thing is i
die oh that's really bad okay second

612
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
die oh that's really bad okay second
 

613
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,430
die oh that's really bad okay second
worst thing is he defends and i lose an

614
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
worst thing is he defends and i lose an
 

615
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,430
worst thing is he defends and i lose an
action for that right so and loss of

616
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
action for that right so and loss of
 

617
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,630
action for that right so and loss of
action we'll talk about that in another

618
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
action we'll talk about that in another
 

619
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,910
action we'll talk about that in another
video that gets into more advanced

620
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
video that gets into more advanced
 

621
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,750
video that gets into more advanced
swordsmanship but that's bad to lose

622
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
swordsmanship but that's bad to lose
 

623
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,990
swordsmanship but that's bad to lose
actions right okay so i've got to find a

624
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
actions right okay so i've got to find a
 

625
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,350
actions right okay so i've got to find a
way to get to this guy right i'm either

626
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
way to get to this guy right i'm either
 

627
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,949
way to get to this guy right i'm either
going to remove a sword i'm going to

628
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
going to remove a sword i'm going to
 

629
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,630
going to remove a sword i'm going to
remove myself to a new line or i'm going

630
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
remove myself to a new line or i'm going
 

631
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,389
remove myself to a new line or i'm going
to wait for him to do something and i'm

632
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
to wait for him to do something and i'm
 

633
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,910
to wait for him to do something and i'm
