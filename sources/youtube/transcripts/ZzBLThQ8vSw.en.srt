00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,189

so this slow training is just moving

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:03,199
so this slow training is just moving
 

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,670
so this slow training is just moving
from control point to control point

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
from control point to control point
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,110
from control point to control point
um without uh

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
um without uh
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,990
um without uh
in this case using the inertia or the

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
in this case using the inertia or the
 

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,549
in this case using the inertia or the
momentum of the person

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
momentum of the person
 

11
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,710

to have that be my control point this is

12
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
to have that be my control point this is
 

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,670
to have that be my control point this is
going to teach you

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
going to teach you
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,470
going to teach you
more um it's going to bring more of the

16
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
more um it's going to bring more of the
 

17
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,510
more um it's going to bring more of the
internal aspects

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
internal aspects
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,910
internal aspects
into it uh but also even better

20
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
into it uh but also even better
 

21
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,269
into it uh but also even better
understanding of just

22
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
understanding of just
 

23
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,070
understanding of just
the anatomy of the human being and their

24
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
the anatomy of the human being and their
 

25
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,790
the anatomy of the human being and their
their

26
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
their
 

27
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,390
their
basic support structure and all that

28
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
basic support structure and all that
 

29
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,310
basic support structure and all that
kind of stuff okay so

30
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
kind of stuff okay so
 

31
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,350
kind of stuff okay so
it's important that he's he's he's got

32
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
it's important that he's he's he's got
 

33
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,470
it's important that he's he's he's got
some energy

34
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
some energy
 

35
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,670
some energy
and i'm going really slow slow slow slow

36
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
and i'm going really slow slow slow slow
 

37
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,790
and i'm going really slow slow slow slow
slow slow

38
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
slow slow
 

39
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,910
slow slow
and i am going to keep working these

40
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
and i am going to keep working these
 

41
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,790
and i am going to keep working these
things

42
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
things
 

43
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,310
things
in a way that um so let's say he

44
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
in a way that um so let's say he
 

45
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,470
in a way that um so let's say he
if he were to resist resist resist

46
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
if he were to resist resist resist
 

47
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,510
if he were to resist resist resist
resist

48
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520

49
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,310

it just works in the conducive you see

50
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
it just works in the conducive you see
 

51
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,790
it just works in the conducive you see
so

52
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
so
 

53
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,990
so
that i have control and then i'm gonna

54
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
that i have control and then i'm gonna
 

55
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,029
that i have control and then i'm gonna
do it in a way

56
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
do it in a way
 

57
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,110
do it in a way
everything in a way that try not to fall

00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
try not to fall and he
 

61
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,510
try not to fall and he
has to fall oh

62
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520

you use uh your your coq or your ip
 

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,990
you use uh your your coq or your ip
and making sure that it's free of any

course you would use
 

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,510
course you would use
but you will have a much more solid

but you will have a much more solid
 

111
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,909
but you will have a much more solid

so i am using koku and nike but i'm

124
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
so i am using koku and nike but i'm
 

125
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,029
so i am using koku and nike but i'm
using it in a way

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,350
it's not oppositional to external things
okay

136
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
okay
 

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,870
okay
so uh as as we go i'll

so he pulls out and i have that energy

166
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
so he pulls out and i have that energy
 

167
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,950

this stuff
okay and um let's say he tries to lift

174
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
okay and um let's say he tries to lift
 

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,150
okay and um let's say he tries to lift
his leg the downward energy here he

176
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
his leg the downward energy here he
 

177
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,670
his leg the downward energy here he
can't lose his leg

178
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
can't lose his leg
 

179
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,790
can't lose his leg
okay uh let's say he uh

180
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
okay uh let's say he uh
 

181
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,230
okay uh let's say he uh
tries to let go here and you'll have the

182
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
tries to let go here and you'll have the
 

183
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,510
tries to let go here and you'll have the
ik adhesion or let's say he tries to

184
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
ik adhesion or let's say he tries to
 

185
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,309
ik adhesion or let's say he tries to
strike me

186
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
strike me
 

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,710
strike me
you'll have the inside line and the same

188
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
you'll have the inside line and the same
 

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,070
you'll have the inside line and the same
thing goes on here

190
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
thing goes on here
 

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,950
thing goes on here
uh you'll have the inside line um he

192
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
uh you'll have the inside line um he
 

193
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,230
uh you'll have the inside line um he
tries to let go

194
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
tries to let go
 

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,629
tries to let go
you still have your own grip so you're

196
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
you still have your own grip so you're
 

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,070
you still have your own grip so you're
in you're in a mechanical

198
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
in you're in a mechanical
 

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,070
in you're in a mechanical
position of control okay and as you move

200
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
position of control okay and as you move
 

201
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,710
position of control okay and as you move
you should

202
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
you should
 

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,589
you should
be doing the same stuff so as i'm about

204
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
be doing the same stuff so as i'm about
 

205
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,390
be doing the same stuff so as i'm about
to

206
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
to
 

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,270
to
uh enter i'm going to bring him around

208
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
uh enter i'm going to bring him around
 

209
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,270
uh enter i'm going to bring him around
in a way that you're just making all of

210
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
in a way that you're just making all of
 

211
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,390
in a way that you're just making all of
that all of that

212
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
that all of that
 

213
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,070
that all of that
worse okay so again let's say he

214
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
worse okay so again let's say he
 

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,469
worse okay so again let's say he
tries to let go on the top hand you're

216
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
tries to let go on the top hand you're
 

217
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,469
tries to let go on the top hand you're
going to have the inside hand

218
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
going to have the inside hand
 

219
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,710
going to have the inside hand
and he let's go on the top hands like

220
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
and he let's go on the top hands like
 

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,390
and he let's go on the top hands like
chess you're going to set up the dilemma

222
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
chess you're going to set up the dilemma
 

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,749
chess you're going to set up the dilemma
of the demon

224
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
of the demon
 

225
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,510
of the demon
because you're on the inside so

226
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
because you're on the inside so
 

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,270
because you're on the inside so
everything is working that way

228
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
everything is working that way
 

229
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,629
everything is working that way
now i don't want him turning either so

230
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
now i don't want him turning either so
 

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,869
now i don't want him turning either so
let's say he tries to turn then he's not

232
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
let's say he tries to turn then he's not
 

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,670
let's say he tries to turn then he's not
going to turn

234
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
going to turn
 

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,830
going to turn
he goes into his base he tries to turn

236
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
he goes into his base he tries to turn
 

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,510
he goes into his base he tries to turn
the other way he's not going to do it

238
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
the other way he's not going to do it
 

239
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,510
the other way he's not going to do it
and of course you have the same dilemma

240
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
and of course you have the same dilemma
 

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,870
and of course you have the same dilemma
so he uh he turns he's turning this way

242
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
so he uh he turns he's turning this way
 

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,790
so he uh he turns he's turning this way
he turns that way you're going to set up

244
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
he turns that way you're going to set up
 

245
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,990
he turns that way you're going to set up
the advantage

246
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
the advantage
 

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,909
the advantage
he turns the other way right you're

248
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
he turns the other way right you're
 

249
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,230
he turns the other way right you're
going to set up the other hand

250
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
going to set up the other hand
 

251
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,750
going to set up the other hand
into the rear body so you're setting up

252
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
into the rear body so you're setting up
 

253
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,829
into the rear body so you're setting up
these energetic dilemmas okay

254
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
these energetic dilemmas okay
 

255
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,630
these energetic dilemmas okay
and now as i move around i'm going to

256
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
and now as i move around i'm going to
 

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,990
and now as i move around i'm going to
add another

258
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
add another
 

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,350
add another
control point at his neck okay

260
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
control point at his neck okay
 

261
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,949
control point at his neck okay
and it's the same thing so if he uh

262
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
and it's the same thing so if he uh
 

263
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,230
and it's the same thing so if he uh
let's go you still have the arm if he

264
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
let's go you still have the arm if he
 

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,190
let's go you still have the arm if he
lets go

266
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
lets go
 

267
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,829
lets go
you still have the arm and but you now

268
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
you still have the arm and but you now
 

269
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,310
you still have the arm and but you now
have a more direct control of his center

270
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
have a more direct control of his center
 

271
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,310
have a more direct control of his center
line through his spine so you should use

272
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
line through his spine so you should use
 

273
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,949
line through his spine so you should use
it you should not be going around this

274
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
it you should not be going around this
 

275
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,829
it you should not be going around this
i make that adhesion point and i use

276
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
i make that adhesion point and i use
 

277
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,870
i make that adhesion point and i use
that

278
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
that
 

279
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,190
that
to keep the head where it is as the

280
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
to keep the head where it is as the
 

281
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,110
to keep the head where it is as the
hands and the weight shift can continue

282
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
hands and the weight shift can continue
 

283
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,389
hands and the weight shift can continue
to bring it forward

284
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
to bring it forward
 

285
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,430
to bring it forward
and he's more into the tilt okay so

286
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
and he's more into the tilt okay so
 

287
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,230
and he's more into the tilt okay so
again

288
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
again
 

289
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,710
again
if he lets go it's almost irrelevant

290
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
if he lets go it's almost irrelevant
 

291
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,269
if he lets go it's almost irrelevant
it's going to be

292
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
it's going to be
 

293
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,750
it's going to be
in space that i can use to hinder do it

294
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
in space that i can use to hinder do it
 

295
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,110
in space that i can use to hinder do it
again it's going to let me

296
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
again it's going to let me
 

297
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,829
again it's going to let me
enter if he let's go on the other hand

298
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
enter if he let's go on the other hand
 

299
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,750
enter if he let's go on the other hand
the head is already under control i made

300
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
the head is already under control i made
 

301
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:35,990
the head is already under control i made
that

302
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
that
 

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,310
that
hand redundant with the head control all

304
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
hand redundant with the head control all
 

305
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,110
hand redundant with the head control all
right now

306
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
right now
 

307
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,230
right now
let's just say uh he just resists and

308
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
let's just say uh he just resists and
 

309
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,870
let's just say uh he just resists and
taps

310
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
taps
 

311
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,269
taps
well it all goes into the same ground

312
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
well it all goes into the same ground
 

313
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,470
well it all goes into the same ground
victory

victory
and then as i come into the throw

316
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
and then as i come into the throw
 

317
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,870
and then as i come into the throw
i do the throw i'm not going to use

318
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
i do the throw i'm not going to use
 

319
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,260
i do the throw i'm not going to use
momentum and take him out

320
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,270

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
i'm going to structurally
 

325
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,990
i'm going to structurally
vector in a way that

326
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
vector in a way that
 

327
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,030
vector in a way that
he's being deconstructed posturally okay

328
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
he's being deconstructed posturally okay
 

329
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,430
he's being deconstructed posturally okay
so resist

330
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440

 

331
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,710

and i want to carry that idea

332
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
and i want to carry that idea
 

333
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,150
and i want to carry that idea
all all the way through so even when i

334
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
all all the way through so even when i
 

335
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,750
all all the way through so even when i
get to the end

336
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
get to the end
 

337
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,150
get to the end
i don't go momentum

338
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160

 

339
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,069

i keep uh pressuring his center

340
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
i keep uh pressuring his center
 

341
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,430
i keep uh pressuring his center
so i'm here and i look for the hip lock

342
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
so i'm here and i look for the hip lock
 

343
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,990
so i'm here and i look for the hip lock
now

344
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
now
 

345
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,470
now
the hip lock and the headlock and that's

346
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
the hip lock and the headlock and that's
 

347
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,470
the hip lock and the headlock and that's
what does the throat

348
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480

 

349
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870

so i have a mechanical control the

350
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
so i have a mechanical control the
 

351
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,590
so i have a mechanical control the
entire time

352
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
entire time
 

353
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,710
entire time
boom

354
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720

 

355
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,509

same even on enikio not out here where

356
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
same even on enikio not out here where
 

357
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,949
same even on enikio not out here where
it's handsome

358
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
it's handsome
 

359
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,550
it's handsome
so boom i gotta get to the inside

360
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
so boom i gotta get to the inside
 

361
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,470
so boom i gotta get to the inside
inside so he let's go

362
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
inside so he let's go
 

363
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,710
inside so he let's go
i'm on the inside

364
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720

 

365
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,590

he tries to push and grab a factory he

366
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
he tries to push and grab a factory he
 

367
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,910
he tries to push and grab a factory he
tries to pull it just feeds the detail

368
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
tries to pull it just feeds the detail
 

369
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,509
tries to pull it just feeds the detail
okay and then same thing don't tilt him

370
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
okay and then same thing don't tilt him
 

371
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,750
okay and then same thing don't tilt him
over himself

372
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
over himself
 

373
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,829
over himself
keep structurally compressing

374
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

375
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,230

post until it's deconstructed

376
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
post until it's deconstructed
 

377
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,990
post until it's deconstructed
quite hand around

378
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000

 

379
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,990

pull no push

380
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
pull no push
 

381
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,670
pull no push
no it's not gonna work but then don't go

382
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
no it's not gonna work but then don't go
 

383
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,110
no it's not gonna work but then don't go
momentum at this

384
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
momentum at this
 

385
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,150
momentum at this
rate mechanically make sure your throw

386
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
rate mechanically make sure your throw
 

387
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,269
rate mechanically make sure your throw
is happening

388
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279

 

389
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:04,949

so resist

390
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959

 

391
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,150

okay try try to make it where you take

392
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
okay try try to make it where you take
 

393
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,790
okay try try to make it where you take
out all the inertial momentum

394
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
out all the inertial momentum
 

395
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
out all the inertial momentum
okay
