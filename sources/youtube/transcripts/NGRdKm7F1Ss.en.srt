trying to get
you can do one hand or the other. I

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
you can do one hand or the other. I
 

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,190
you can do one hand or the other. I
don't know. I wouldn't do the zombie

10
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
don't know. I wouldn't do the zombie
 

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,670
don't know. I wouldn't do the zombie
thing if I were you guys. Okay.

12
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
thing if I were you guys. Okay.
 

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,230
thing if I were you guys. Okay.
>> But Both of you are like blocking lots

00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
>> But Both of you are like blocking lots
 

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,350
>> But Both of you are like blocking lots
of places.

16
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
of places.
 

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,590
of places.
>> So you block. What are you going to do?

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
>> So you block. What are you going to do?
 

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,830
>> So you block. What are you going to do?
You block and then you're looking for

20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
You block and then you're looking for
 

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,069
You block and then you're looking for
this like a ledge like that.

22
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
this like a ledge like that.
 

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,789
this like a ledge like that.
>> You see? But if you look at her spine,

24
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
>> You see? But if you look at her spine,
 

25
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,630
>> You see? But if you look at her spine,
it's not all that compromised. And don't

26
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
it's not all that compromised. And don't
 

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,830
it's not all that compromised. And don't
don't move anything. Okay? For example,

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
don't move anything. Okay? For example,
 

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,149
don't move anything. Okay? For example,
this tilt. If you straighten your head

30
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
this tilt. If you straighten your head
 

31
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,149
this tilt. If you straighten your head
better, no, like here. See, you're like

32
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
better, no, like here. See, you're like
 

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,950
better, no, like here. See, you're like
that. I have no control over her head

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
that. I have no control over her head
 

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,230
that. I have no control over her head
from this angle. You move your head up

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
from this angle. You move your head up
 

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,550
from this angle. You move your head up
and down all around. I cannot stop that

38
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
and down all around. I cannot stop that
 

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,990
and down all around. I cannot stop that
from happening. So you going here for

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
from happening. So you going here for
 

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,550
from happening. So you going here for
for no freaking reason. And that's

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
for no freaking reason. And that's
 

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,110
for no freaking reason. And that's
making your center of gravity go up.

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
making your center of gravity go up.
 

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,510
making your center of gravity go up.
>> But you don't have to. Now stay stay

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
>> But you don't have to. Now stay stay
 

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,510
>> But you don't have to. Now stay stay
where you are and from here straighten

48
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
where you are and from here straighten
 

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,390
where you are and from here straighten
your spine. Do you see?

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
your spine. Do you see?
 

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,229
your spine. Do you see?
>> I'm not telling you to go back. I'm just

52
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
>> I'm not telling you to go back. I'm just
 

53

>> I'm not telling you to go back. I'm just
You're hunched.

54
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
You're hunched.
 

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,390
You're hunched.
>> Do you get it? And I can't make you I

56
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
>> Do you get it? And I can't make you I
 

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,190
>> Do you get it? And I can't make you I
want you to hunch and unhunch. You see

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
want you to hunch and unhunch. You see
 

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,910
want you to hunch and unhunch. You see
that? I I cannot control that from here.

60
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
that? I I cannot control that from here.
 

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,630
that? I I cannot control that from here.
>> I can't control her head. You get it?

62
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
>> I can't control her head. You get it?
 

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,229
>> I can't control her head. You get it?
So, I get that there's some tilt here,

64
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
So, I get that there's some tilt here,
 

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,670
So, I get that there's some tilt here,
but if you would fix your head and fix

66
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
but if you would fix your head and fix
 

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,830
but if you would fix your head and fix
your spine, I'm not telling you to go

68
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
your spine, I'm not telling you to go
 

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,070
your spine, I'm not telling you to go
back. You're doing just you're punching

70
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
back. You're doing just you're punching
 

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,430
back. You're doing just you're punching
for no reason.

72
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
for no reason.
 

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,390
for no reason.
>> Okay?

74
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
>> Okay?
 

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,110
>> Okay?
>> So, she's pretty freaking balanced. So,

76
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
>> So, she's pretty freaking balanced. So,
 

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,710
>> So, she's pretty freaking balanced. So,
stay just stay where you are. You don't

78
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
stay just stay where you are. You don't
 

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,110
stay just stay where you are. You don't
need that hand. Just stay where you are.

80
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
need that hand. Just stay where you are.
 

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,710
need that hand. Just stay where you are.
Okay, I'm going to take my hand away.

82
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
Okay, I'm going to take my hand away.
 

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,589
Okay, I'm going to take my hand away.
Stay where you are.

Stay where you are.
>> Where was her line of gravity? It's

86
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
>> Where was her line of gravity? It's
 

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,229
>> Where was her line of gravity? It's
inside her base of support.

88
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
inside her base of support.
 

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,589
inside her base of support.
>> There's this is not kazushi. Okay. So,

90
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
>> There's this is not kazushi. Okay. So,
 

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,830
>> There's this is not kazushi. Okay. So,
what happens is you guys will get here

92
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
what happens is you guys will get here
 

93
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,149
what happens is you guys will get here
in the other hand. Okay. You'll get here

94
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
in the other hand. Okay. You'll get here
 

95
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,910
in the other hand. Okay. You'll get here
and now you just kind of push this into

96
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
and now you just kind of push this into
 

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,630
and now you just kind of push this into
some semblance of the front inward

98
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
some semblance of the front inward
 

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,830
some semblance of the front inward
kazushi.

100
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
kazushi.
 

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,710
kazushi.
>> Okay. So I'll I'll say it again is

102
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
>> Okay. So I'll I'll say it again is
 

103
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,070
>> Okay. So I'll I'll say it again is
you'll find some ledge. There it is. And

104
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
you'll find some ledge. There it is. And
 

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,110
you'll find some ledge. There it is. And
then you push you're pushing it. Okay.

106
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
then you push you're pushing it. Okay.
 

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,390
then you push you're pushing it. Okay.
And there was of course those who go

108
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
And there was of course those who go
 

109
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,630
And there was of course those who go
that way. But even here you guys are

110
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
that way. But even here you guys are
 

111
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,509
that way. But even here you guys are
like pushing it into that. Okay.

112
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
like pushing it into that. Okay.
 

113
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,589
like pushing it into that. Okay.
We go. And I want to use the the the

114
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
We go. And I want to use the the the
 

115
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,070
We go. And I want to use the the the
yield on the adhesion. Do you see that

116
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
yield on the adhesion. Do you see that
 

117
00:03:46,080 --> 00:04:05,350
yield on the adhesion. Do you see that
difference? Okay. Stay where you are.

118
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360

 

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,509

Okay, got it.

120
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519

 

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,869

>> You see?

122
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
>> You see?
 

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,390
>> You see?
>> So, again, this is very common cuz we're

124
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
>> So, again, this is very common cuz we're
 

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,670
>> So, again, this is very common cuz we're
in a contestation is you're like, I I

126
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
in a contestation is you're like, I I
 

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,749
in a contestation is you're like, I I
can feel that. And then you try to use

128
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
can feel that. And then you try to use
 

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,189
can feel that. And then you try to use
that, but it's actually over here. And

130
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
that, but it's actually over here. And
 

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:33,749
that, but it's actually over here. And
then you'll find

132
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,830

find that. Okay,

134
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
find that. Okay,
 

135
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,189
find that. Okay,
>> you guys understand? So, you have to

136
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
>> you guys understand? So, you have to
 

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,189
>> you guys understand? So, you have to
look at all the places where you're like

138
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
look at all the places where you're like
 

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,430
look at all the places where you're like
stopping her

140
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
stopping her
 

141
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,469
stopping her
>> and then realize you're trying to stop

142
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
>> and then realize you're trying to stop
 

143
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,350
>> and then realize you're trying to stop
just so you can find a ledge to now do

144
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
just so you can find a ledge to now do
 

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
just so you can find a ledge to now do
that kind of stuff. Okay?

146
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
that kind of stuff. Okay?
 

147
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,310
that kind of stuff. Okay?
>> It's not the same. So, we're here. You

148
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
>> It's not the same. So, we're here. You
 

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:03,189
>> It's not the same. So, we're here. You
see, it's on that hand. Again,

150
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199

 

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,510

if I just get out of the way, it doesn't

152
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
if I just get out of the way, it doesn't
 

153
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,550
if I just get out of the way, it doesn't
do anything cuz she's trying to counter.

154
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
do anything cuz she's trying to counter.
 

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,710
do anything cuz she's trying to counter.
So, she wouldn't fall off balance

156
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
So, she wouldn't fall off balance
 

157
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,990
So, she wouldn't fall off balance
like modern Iikido imagines

158
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
like modern Iikido imagines
 

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,909
like modern Iikido imagines

160
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
people will do. Do you know, you move
 

161
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,270
people will do. Do you know, you move
out of the way and they're they're going

162
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
out of the way and they're they're going
 

163
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,710
out of the way and they're they're going
to fall into you and and go, "The

to fall into you and and go, "The

167
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,909
chair got pulled out." You know what I
mean? This this just doesn't happen. So,

168
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
mean? This this just doesn't happen. So,
 

169
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,189
mean? This this just doesn't happen. So,
you have to be the one to find the

170
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
you have to be the one to find the
 

171
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,550
you have to be the one to find the
adhesions to create the balance

172
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
adhesions to create the balance
 

173
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,790
adhesions to create the balance
breaking.

174
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
breaking.
 

175
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
breaking.
And you'll never do it by looking for a

176
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
And you'll never do it by looking for a
 

177
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,670
And you'll never do it by looking for a
ledge that you can now push them on.

178
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
ledge that you can now push them on.
 

179
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,189
ledge that you can now push them on.

186
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
against it. Now again, when when when
 

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,950
against it. Now again, when when when
I'm here and you feel that value,

188
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm here and you feel that value,
 

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,469
I'm here and you feel that value,
>> okay,

190
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
>> okay,
 

191
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,510
>> okay,
you want to think she's just going to

192
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
you want to think she's just going to
 

193
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,909
you want to think she's just going to
pull back. Like you want to think that

194
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
pull back. Like you want to think that
 

195
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,950
pull back. Like you want to think that
she'll pull back, but what's happening?

196
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
she'll pull back, but what's happening?
 

197
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,590
she'll pull back, but what's happening?
It's getting stickier. Do you see that?

198
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
It's getting stickier. Do you see that?
 

199
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,909
It's getting stickier. Do you see that?
So again,

200
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
So again,
 

201
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,550
So again,
you in Patreon just you can't feel that.

202
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
you in Patreon just you can't feel that.
 

203
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,629
you in Patreon just you can't feel that.
So you don't know what it is. But I

204
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
So you don't know what it is. But I
 

205
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,590
So you don't know what it is. But I
think physics physic wise, you can

206
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
think physics physic wise, you can
 

207
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,950
think physics physic wise, you can
understand it. If if there is if the

208
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
understand it. If if there is if the
 

209
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,189
understand it. If if there is if the
fact that I'm matching

210
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
fact that I'm matching
 

211
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,950
fact that I'm matching
friction, when she gives me the counter

212
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
friction, when she gives me the counter
 

213
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,029
friction, when she gives me the counter
opposing force, it's going to increase

214
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
opposing force, it's going to increase
 

215
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,150
opposing force, it's going to increase
the force at the contact. And so I just

216
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
the force at the contact. And so I just
 

217
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,550
the force at the contact. And so I just
maintain that friction and it just gets

218
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
maintain that friction and it just gets
 

219
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:12,550
maintain that friction and it just gets
stickier when she does that

220
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560

 

221
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,230

does that. Which is why when you watch

222
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
does that. Which is why when you watch
 

223
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,990
does that. Which is why when you watch
more of our advanced videos, you'll

224
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
more of our advanced videos, you'll
 

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,749
more of our advanced videos, you'll
never see Ronin pull back on that. He

226
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
never see Ronin pull back on that. He
 

227
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,150
never see Ronin pull back on that. He
has to get off of it. Okay? He can't

228
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
has to get off of it. Okay? He can't
 

229
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,870
has to get off of it. Okay? He can't
pull back. He has to I'll do it. Okay?

230
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
pull back. He has to I'll do it. Okay?
 

231
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,189
pull back. He has to I'll do it. Okay?
So you're you're like take it however

232
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
So you're you're like take it however
 

233
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,670
So you're you're like take it however
you want. Okay. Try to even hook it. You

234
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
you want. Okay. Try to even hook it. You
 

235
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,189
you want. Okay. Try to even hook it. You
could just grab it. Okay.

236
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
could just grab it. Okay.
 

237
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,990
could just grab it. Okay.
>> If I pull back, I'm increasing the force

there. Okay.
 

241
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,990
there. Okay.
>> And so I don't pull back. I find a way

242
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
>> And so I don't pull back. I find a way
 

243
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,830
>> And so I don't pull back. I find a way
to go around the force. I got to free my

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
to go around the force. I got to free my
 

245
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,790
to go around the force. I got to free my
center from your adhesion point.

246
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
center from your adhesion point.
 

247
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,430

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
>> Okay. Um
 

249
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,189
>> Okay. Um
so there is a yield. Yes. But it is an

250
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
so there is a yield. Yes. But it is an
 

251
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,150
so there is a yield. Yes. But it is an
adhesion that's pulling you into the

00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
adhesion that's pulling you into the
 

253
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,990
adhesion that's pulling you into the
yield

254
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
yield
 

255
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,350
yield
which you either instinctually untrained

256
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
which you either instinctually untrained
 

257
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,749
which you either instinctually untrained
people will pull against it. It's you're

258
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
people will pull against it. It's you're
 

259
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,869
people will pull against it. It's you're
making it worse. Trained people will now

260
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
making it worse. Trained people will now
 

261
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,710
making it worse. Trained people will now
have to yin yield. Got it.

262
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
have to yin yield. Got it.
 

263
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,230
have to yin yield. Got it.
So I'll I'll just get you here. Okay.

264
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
So I'll I'll just get you here. Okay.
 

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,430
So I'll I'll just get you here. Okay.
There it is. Now you got to free the

266
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
There it is. Now you got to free the
 

267
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,830
There it is. Now you got to free the
adhesion point.

268
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
adhesion point.
 

269
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,710
adhesion point.
Yeah. Come on. There she goes. Okay. I

270
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah. Come on. There she goes. Okay. I
 

271
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,550
Yeah. Come on. There she goes. Okay. I
don't know why you would touch me again.

272
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
don't know why you would touch me again.
 

273
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,909
don't know why you would touch me again.
Okay. You free. Free. Yes. Do you see?

274
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
Okay. You free. Free. Yes. Do you see?
 

275
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,390
Okay. You free. Free. Yes. Do you see?
But pay attention. Do that same one.

276
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
But pay attention. Do that same one.
 

277
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,630
But pay attention. Do that same one.
Where's her hand going? Back. Back

278
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
Where's her hand going? Back. Back
 

279
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,550
Where's her hand going? Back. Back
towards her. Do you see?

280
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
towards her. Do you see?
 

281
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,469
towards her. Do you see?
>> So, she's not going to go forward cuz

282
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
>> So, she's not going to go forward cuz
 

283
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,550
>> So, she's not going to go forward cuz
that would just continue her her

284
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
that would just continue her her
 

285
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,670
that would just continue her her
kazushi. She can't pull back on it. She

286
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
kazushi. She can't pull back on it. She
 

287
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,070
kazushi. She can't pull back on it. She
has to come back into herself. And

288
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
has to come back into herself. And
 

289
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,710
has to come back into herself. And
that's the hyper yin yield that that you

290
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
that's the hyper yin yield that that you
 

291
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,750
that's the hyper yin yield that that you
want. Okay. So, when when I go here, she

292
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
want. Okay. So, when when I go here, she
 

293
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,430
want. Okay. So, when when I go here, she
hyper yin yield. Boom. This is where you

294
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
hyper yin yield. Boom. This is where you
 

295
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:06,630
hyper yin yield. Boom. This is where you
follow it in

296
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640

 

297
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,790

to whatever. Okay. In our game when when

298
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
to whatever. Okay. In our game when when
 

299
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,590
to whatever. Okay. In our game when when
I'm here and she hyper yin heels, I

300
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm here and she hyper yin heels, I
 

301
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,030
I'm here and she hyper yin heels, I
practice the following skill back to

302
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
practice the following skill back to
 

303
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,990
practice the following skill back to
another adhesion point.

another adhesion point.
Okay. Does that make sense?

306
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
Okay. Does that make sense?
 

307
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,870
Okay. Does that make sense?

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
should have done with the adhesion
 

317
00:09:34,880 --> 00:10:24,310
should have done with the adhesion
point. Okay.

318
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320

 

319
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,190

Hello.

320
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200

 

321
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:47,030

Hello.

322
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040

 

323
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,850

Hello.

324
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:48,860
Hello.
 

325
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,470
Hello.
[Music]

326
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480

 

327
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,310

Um

328
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
Um
 

329
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,350
Um
well again repeating there is a yin

330
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
well again repeating there is a yin
 

331
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,430
well again repeating there is a yin
yield

332
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
yield
 

333
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,230
yield
but it must be

334
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
but it must be
 

335
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,710
but it must be
an adhesion. So let's let's put it a

336
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
an adhesion. So let's let's put it a
 

337
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,269
an adhesion. So let's let's put it a
little differently. Those are not either

338
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
little differently. Those are not either
 

339
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,230
little differently. Those are not either
or. There's a hidden heel

340
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
or. There's a hidden heel
 

341
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,750
or. There's a hidden heel
with an adhesion. Okay. So as we're

342
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
with an adhesion. Okay. So as we're
 

343
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,910
with an adhesion. Okay. So as we're
going that assaulted energy,

344
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
going that assaulted energy,
 

345
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,030
going that assaulted energy,
I have to get out of the way. You

346
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
I have to get out of the way. You
 

347
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,269
I have to get out of the way. You
understand? So let's let's look at that

348
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
understand? So let's let's look at that
 

349
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,670
understand? So let's let's look at that
same one.

350
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
same one.
 

351
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,550
same one.
I have the angle of deflection.

352
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
I have the angle of deflection.
 

353
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,750
I have the angle of deflection.
So he's pushing here, right? Stay there.

354
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
So he's pushing here, right? Stay there.
 

355
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,990
So he's pushing here, right? Stay there.
Stay there. And I'm at the distal end of

356
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
Stay there. And I'm at the distal end of
 

357
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,230
Stay there. And I'm at the distal end of
the lever.

358
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
the lever.
 

359
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,509
the lever.
So as as he has an intention here, he

360
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
So as as he has an intention here, he
 

361
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,990
So as as he has an intention here, he
can't do anything here. Do you

362
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
can't do anything here. Do you
 

363
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,870
can't do anything here. Do you
understand? You can't do anything at on

364
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
understand? You can't do anything at on
 

365
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,790
understand? You can't do anything at on
these 90°

366
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
these 90°
 

367
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,110
these 90°
because of the distal end lever here

368
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
because of the distal end lever here
 

369
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,949
because of the distal end lever here
theory. Got that? Okay. So, I have a

370
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
theory. Got that? Okay. So, I have a
 

371
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,269
theory. Got that? Okay. So, I have a
deflection. I'm I'm not going to do it

372
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
deflection. I'm I'm not going to do it
 

373
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,230
deflection. I'm I'm not going to do it
here because my lever is shorter.

374
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
here because my lever is shorter.
 

375
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,509
here because my lever is shorter.
So, I do it here. Okay. Yes. Then there

376
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
So, I do it here. Okay. Yes. Then there
 

377
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,990
So, I do it here. Okay. Yes. Then there
was the angle of deviation here. So he's

378
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
was the angle of deviation here. So he's
 

379
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,949
was the angle of deviation here. So he's
trying to hit here and I go whoa like

380
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
trying to hit here and I go whoa like
 

381
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,230
trying to hit here and I go whoa like
that. You see that? Okay. Those all of

382
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
that. You see that? Okay. Those all of
 

383
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,870
that. You see that? Okay. Those all of
that happened.

384
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
that happened.
 

385
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,990
that happened.
But if I just move out of the way, then

386
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
But if I just move out of the way, then
 

387
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,670
But if I just move out of the way, then
you have that same thing. Stay where you

388
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
you have that same thing. Stay where you
 

389
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,150
you have that same thing. Stay where you
are. Don't move. I'm going to let go.

390
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
are. Don't move. I'm going to let go.
 

391
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,670
are. Don't move. I'm going to let go.
And he's in perfect balance. Okay.

392
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680

 

393
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,629

So I do have to do this, but I have to

394
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
So I do have to do this, but I have to
 

395
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,509
So I do have to do this, but I have to
get that adhesion.

396
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
get that adhesion.
 

397
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,949
get that adhesion.
That is what I have to get. So that I

398
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
That is what I have to get. So that I
 

399
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,069
That is what I have to get. So that I
create the dilemma. He's either going to

400
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
create the dilemma. He's either going to
 

401
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,269
create the dilemma. He's either going to
keep going or he has to get off of it.

402
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
keep going or he has to get off of it.
 

403
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,150
keep going or he has to get off of it.
And then we have

404
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
And then we have
 

405
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:24,069
And then we have
the other

406
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079

 

407
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,829

The other thing, do you get it?

408
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
The other thing, do you get it?
 

409
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,310
The other thing, do you get it?
>> Yes, sir.

410
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
>> Yes, sir.
 

411
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,389
>> Yes, sir.
>> Right now, you guys have no

412
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
>> Right now, you guys have no
 

413
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,470
>> Right now, you guys have no
ide

414
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480

 

415
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,069

without

416
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
without
 

417
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,949
without
getting stuff off the line.

418
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
getting stuff off the line.
 

419
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,990
getting stuff off the line.
Do you understand that?

420
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you understand that?
 

421
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,550
Do you understand that?
>> Yes.

422
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
>> Yes.
 

423
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,590
>> Yes.
>> So, as he's going, you have to get him

424
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
>> So, as he's going, you have to get him
 

425
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:55,269
>> So, as he's going, you have to get him
off the off

426
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279

 

427
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,470

the line. See, he's not on the line. And

428
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
the line. See, he's not on the line. And
 

429
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,790
the line. See, he's not on the line. And
you could you saw his balance kind of

430
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
you could you saw his balance kind of
 

431
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,590
you could you saw his balance kind of
wobble. Okay. And I'm not going to

432
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
wobble. Okay. And I'm not going to
 

433
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,069
wobble. Okay. And I'm not going to
take the throw where his balance is. So,

434
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
take the throw where his balance is. So,
 

435
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,990
take the throw where his balance is. So,
for example, I'm not going to try to

436
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
for example, I'm not going to try to
 

437
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,949
for example, I'm not going to try to
take his line of gravity and try to get

438
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
take his line of gravity and try to get
 

439
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,269
take his line of gravity and try to get
past that outside base of support. I'm

440
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
past that outside base of support. I'm
 

441
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,509
past that outside base of support. I'm
not going to do that. And it's not going

442
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
not going to do that. And it's not going
 

443
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,990
not going to do that. And it's not going
to be here either. It's somewhere around

444
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
to be here either. It's somewhere around
 

445
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,110
to be here either. It's somewhere around
here. That's too far.

446
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
here. That's too far.
 

447
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,790
here. That's too far.
That's closer. So, that's where I go.

448
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
That's closer. So, that's where I go.
 

449
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,550
That's closer. So, that's where I go.
Do you see that? Do you guys understand

450
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
Do you see that? Do you guys understand
 

451
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,790
Do you see that? Do you guys understand
that? Okay.

452
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
that? Okay.
 

453
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,110
that? Okay.
But he's probably going to do something.

454
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
But he's probably going to do something.
 

455
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,550
But he's probably going to do something.
No, he does something.

456
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
No, he does something.
 

457
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,870
No, he does something.
Do you do you see you get it? But if you

458
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
Do you do you see you get it? But if you
 

459
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,590
Do you do you see you get it? But if you
don't get him on his initial assault to

460
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
don't get him on his initial assault to
 

461
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,110
don't get him on his initial assault to
get him in a compromised position when

462
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
get him in a compromised position when
 

463
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,030
get him in a compromised position when
he does something, you won't be able to

464
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
he does something, you won't be able to
 

465
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,389
he does something, you won't be able to
as easily keep the advantage. When

466
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
as easily keep the advantage. When
 

467
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,470
as easily keep the advantage. When
you're here like that, he's going to do

468
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
you're here like that, he's going to do
 

469
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,509
you're here like that, he's going to do
something. He's perfectly balanced.

470
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
something. He's perfectly balanced.
 

471
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,069
something. He's perfectly balanced.
You're going to if you get it one time,

472
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
You're going to if you get it one time,
 

473
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,750
You're going to if you get it one time,
two times, you're not going to get it

474
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
two times, you're not going to get it
 

475
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,590
two times, you're not going to get it
the fifth part. It's not and that's

476
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600

Okay, they you let them attack you.

640
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
Okay, they you let them attack you.
 

641
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,070
Okay, they you let them attack you.
Don't stop them. They come in. That's

642
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
Don't stop them. They come in. That's
 

643
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,310
Don't stop them. They come in. That's
what I want. I pulled you to there. You

644
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
what I want. I pulled you to there. You
 

645
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,270
what I want. I pulled you to there. You
decide what you're going to do

646
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
decide what you're going to do
 

647
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,990
decide what you're going to do
and I follow.

648
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
and I follow.
 

649
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:25,990
and I follow.
You go again.

650
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000

 

651
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,470

all comes from levy memor. Okay.

652
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
all comes from levy memor. Okay.
 

653
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,470
all comes from levy memor. Okay.
If I if I if I go here, you'll see like

654
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
If I if I if I go here, you'll see like
 

655
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,029
If I if I if I go here, you'll see like
it's about to lose. Do you get it? Okay.

656
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
it's about to lose. Do you get it? Okay.
 

657
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,950
it's about to lose. Do you get it? Okay.
Um but I can make

658
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
Um but I can make
 

659
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,510
Um but I can make
by what I do with this hand. So for

660
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
by what I do with this hand. So for
 

661
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,669
by what I do with this hand. So for
example,

662
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
example,
 

663
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,270
example,
this this is now going to be over yong.

664
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
this this is now going to be over yong.
 

665
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,070
this this is now going to be over yong.
Do do you feel that? Okay. But if this

666
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
Do do you feel that? Okay. But if this
 

667
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,270
Do do you feel that? Okay. But if this
hand now keeps you going that way. Do

668
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
hand now keeps you going that way. Do
 

669
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,470
hand now keeps you going that way. Do
you understand?

670
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
you understand?
 

671
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,750
you understand?
>> Now now it won't be over yong.

672
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
>> Now now it won't be over yong.
 

673
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,310
>> Now now it won't be over yong.
>> Okay. Right.

674
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
>> Okay. Right.
 

675
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,310
>> Okay. Right.
But sometimes

676
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
But sometimes
 

677
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,390
But sometimes
as we're going right, I'm trying to get

678
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
as we're going right, I'm trying to get
 

679
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,070
as we're going right, I'm trying to get
that it's starting to starting to

680
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
that it's starting to starting to
 

681
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,390
that it's starting to starting to
weaken. You see they start to slip

682
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
weaken. You see they start to slip
 

683
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,909
weaken. You see they start to slip
because

684
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
because
 

685
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,830
because
of it it's entering its yin phase. Well,

686
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
of it it's entering its yin phase. Well,
 

687
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,029
of it it's entering its yin phase. Well,
if what I want to accomplish requires

688
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
if what I want to accomplish requires
 

689
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,470
if what I want to accomplish requires
less adhesion, the yin phase will work.

690
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
less adhesion, the yin phase will work.
 

691
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,310
less adhesion, the yin phase will work.
So if I'm moving you that way, it's with

692
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
So if I'm moving you that way, it's with
 

693
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:47,029
So if I'm moving you that way, it's with
the other hand, it's doing that job.

694
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039

 

695
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,830

So that is one way

696
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,840
So that is one way
 

697
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,070
So that is one way
that I only got let's say the adhesion

698
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
that I only got let's say the adhesion
 

699
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,510
that I only got let's say the adhesion
has a young value of five but the but

700
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
has a young value of five but the but
 

701
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,029
has a young value of five but the but
your balance requires a young value of

702
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
your balance requires a young value of
 

703
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,830
your balance requires a young value of
six. Do you see that? By moving you with

704
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
six. Do you see that? By moving you with
 

705
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,710
six. Do you see that? By moving you with
the other hand your balance now requires

706
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
the other hand your balance now requires
 

707
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,190
the other hand your balance now requires
a young value of three and five was

708
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
a young value of three and five was
 

709
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,549
a young value of three and five was
plenty. You see? So I'm using one hand

710
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
plenty. You see? So I'm using one hand
 

711
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,350
plenty. You see? So I'm using one hand
in this case to make whatever value is

712
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
in this case to make whatever value is
 

713
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,350
in this case to make whatever value is
there still viable. Okay. But sometimes

714
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
there still viable. Okay. But sometimes
 

715
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,390
there still viable. Okay. But sometimes
as as we're going right I can uh in this

716
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
as as we're going right I can uh in this
 

717
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,110
as as we're going right I can uh in this
case what I'm going to do is the two

718
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
case what I'm going to do is the two
 

719
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,110
case what I'm going to do is the two
adhesions.

720
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
adhesions.
 

721
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,430
adhesions.
Let's say they're both at three. You see

722
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
Let's say they're both at three. You see
 

723
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,870
Let's say they're both at three. You see
that one at three won't work. You have a

724
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
that one at three won't work. You have a
 

725
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,350
that one at three won't work. You have a
a a disturbance value of six. But

726
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
a a disturbance value of six. But
 

727
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:46,950
a a disturbance value of six. But
together the two will work.

728
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960

 

729
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,070

3 + 3. Do you understand that? So that's

730
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
3 + 3. Do you understand that? So that's
 

731
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,430
3 + 3. Do you understand that? So that's
another way. Okay. And and another way

732
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
another way. Okay. And and another way
 

733
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,270
another way. Okay. And and another way
that I can do this, it's it's going to

734
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,280
that I can do this, it's it's going to
 

735
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,029
that I can do this, it's it's going to
be not so possible at the at the four

736
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
be not so possible at the at the four
 

737
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,990
be not so possible at the at the four
and eight. Okay. But as I get the

738
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
and eight. Okay. But as I get the
 

739
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,950
and eight. Okay. But as I get the
adhesion, like it's right here. Okay.

740
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
adhesion, like it's right here. Okay.
 

741
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,190
adhesion, like it's right here. Okay.
But you can feel it's at its edge. Do

742
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
But you can feel it's at its edge. Do
 

743
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,029
But you can feel it's at its edge. Do
you see that? Okay. So, I'll turn your

744
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
you see that? Okay. So, I'll turn your
 

745
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,950
you see that? Okay. So, I'll turn your
body to keep it

746
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960

 

747
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,510

to do that. So, in this case, the it's

748
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
to do that. So, in this case, the it's
 

749
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,549
to do that. So, in this case, the it's
only at its edge. See there? It's only

750
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
only at its edge. See there? It's only
 

751
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,549
only at its edge. See there? It's only
at its edge when it go when it's going

752
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
at its edge when it go when it's going
 

753
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,470
at its edge when it go when it's going
straight. But once it starts to go

754
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
straight. But once it starts to go
 

755
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,070
straight. But once it starts to go
around me,

756
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
around me,
 

757
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,070
around me,
>> do you see?

758
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
>> do you see?
 

759
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,070
>> do you see?
>> It's now going to be You might want to

760
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
>> It's now going to be You might want to
 

761
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,549
>> It's now going to be You might want to
go on that side.

762
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
go on that side.
 

763
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,350
go on that side.
this this parallel angle

764
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
this this parallel angle
 

765
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,390
this this parallel angle
right is not going to have as much yong

766
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
right is not going to have as much yong
 

767
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,310
right is not going to have as much yong
value as if you was curved and I'm doing

768
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
value as if you was curved and I'm doing
 

769
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,310
value as if you was curved and I'm doing
that. You see that? So I use this hand

770
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
that. You see that? So I use this hand
 

771
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,549
that. You see that? So I use this hand
to turn you and then I get more

772
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
to turn you and then I get more
 

773
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:09,350
to turn you and then I get more
adhesion.

774
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360

 

775
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,390

on that on that. You see that? So in

776
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
on that on that. You see that? So in
 

777
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,070
on that on that. You see that? So in
this case, I'm using the one hand to

778
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
this case, I'm using the one hand to
 

779
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,909
this case, I'm using the one hand to
increase the yong value to to do it.

780
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
increase the yong value to to do it.
 

781
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,390
increase the yong value to to do it.
Okay? So so far what I showed you is

782
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
Okay? So so far what I showed you is
 

783
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,190
Okay? So so far what I showed you is
I can move you so that the whatever yong

784
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
I can move you so that the whatever yong
 

785
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,269
I can move you so that the whatever yong
value I got here that was not going to

786
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
value I got here that was not going to
 

787
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,070
value I got here that was not going to
be ample is ample. Then I showed you how

788
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
be ample is ample. Then I showed you how
 

789
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,789
be ample is ample. Then I showed you how
to add the two together so that it is

790
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
to add the two together so that it is
 

791
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,350
to add the two together so that it is
now ample. And then I showed you how to

792
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
now ample. And then I showed you how to
 

793
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,630
now ample. And then I showed you how to
feed so that you get more yon value out

794
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
feed so that you get more yon value out
 

795
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,909
feed so that you get more yon value out
of that. Okay? And the takeaway is that

796
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
of that. Okay? And the takeaway is that
 

797
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,350
of that. Okay? And the takeaway is that
your hams work in conjunction with each

798
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
your hams work in conjunction with each
 

799
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,750
your hams work in conjunction with each
other. Okay? Now

800
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
other. Okay? Now
 

801
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,549
other. Okay? Now
when you felt those good throws, right?

802
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
when you felt those good throws, right?
 

803
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,950
when you felt those good throws, right?
You felt those good throws.

804
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
You felt those good throws.
 

805
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,669
You felt those good throws.
It's because you had the two hands at

806
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
It's because you had the two hands at
 

807
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,430
It's because you had the two hands at
the plus three plus three.

808
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440
the plus three plus three.
 

809
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,830
the plus three plus three.
>> Do you get it? And it's kind of like

810
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
>> Do you get it? And it's kind of like
 

811
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,430
>> Do you get it? And it's kind of like
you're it you're worked out, but he's

812
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
you're it you're worked out, but he's
 

813
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,510
you're it you're worked out, but he's
going to do all kinds of things. And so

814
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
going to do all kinds of things. And so
 

815
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,590
going to do all kinds of things. And so
you need those other ways of having the

816
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
you need those other ways of having the
 

817
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,110
you need those other ways of having the
two hands feed each other. Okay, that's

818
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
two hands feed each other. Okay, that's
 

819
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,430
two hands feed each other. Okay, that's
what I meant.

820
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440

 

821
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,029

Does that

822
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039

 

823
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,149

those two ladder the first one like I'll

824
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
those two ladder the first one like I'll
 

825
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,470
those two ladder the first one like I'll
decrease how much is needed and now I'll

826
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
decrease how much is needed and now I'll
 

827
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,710
decrease how much is needed and now I'll
feed how much I have. Those are more

828
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
feed how much I have. Those are more
 

829
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,950
feed how much I have. Those are more
difficult. And that's why I want you to

830
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
difficult. And that's why I want you to
 

831
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,669
difficult. And that's why I want you to
start with. But so where we always

832
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
start with. But so where we always
 

833
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,710
start with. But so where we always
starting here and moving the whole

834
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
starting here and moving the whole
 

835
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,430
starting here and moving the whole
center of the icy ton. Just keep chasing

836
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
center of the icy ton. Just keep chasing
 

837
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,440
center of the icy ton. Just keep chasing
that.
