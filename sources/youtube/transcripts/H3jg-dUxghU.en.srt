spine our head's at the top here it

22
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:40,760
spine our head's at the top here it
 

23
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,270
spine our head's at the top here it
comes forward and usually what people

24
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
comes forward and usually what people
 

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,189
comes forward and usually what people
think

26
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:45,199
think
 

27
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,670
think
is that it's going to go like this in

28
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,680
is that it's going to go like this in
 

29
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,510
is that it's going to go like this in
some way so sometimes you have some ukas

30
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,520
some way so sometimes you have some ukas
 

31
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,349
some way so sometimes you have some ukas
that will slide

32
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:54,359
that will slide
 

33
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,150
that will slide
under okay and then sometimes you have

34
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,160
under okay and then sometimes you have
 

35
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,029
under okay and then sometimes you have
ukas like if this had a hinge here and

36
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,039
ukas like if this had a hinge here and
 

37
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,910
ukas like if this had a hinge here and
and this top part goes like this they

38
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:02,920
and this top part goes like this they
 

39
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,429
and this top part goes like this they
Bend backwards okay at at the back and

40
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
Bend backwards okay at at the back and
 

41
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,710
Bend backwards okay at at the back and
then they go B they go backwards into

42
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
then they go B they go backwards into
 

43
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,990
then they go B they go backwards into
the back breakfall but either way uh if

44
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
the back breakfall but either way uh if
 

45
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,109
the back breakfall but either way uh if
we just look at the head

46
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:14,119
we just look at the head
 

47
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,070
we just look at the head
area uh it's going that way which in our

48
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
area uh it's going that way which in our
 

49
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,149
area uh it's going that way which in our
Dojo is east and then the head is

50
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
Dojo is east and then the head is
 

51
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,469
Dojo is east and then the head is
brought West okay and either way whether

52
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:25,479
brought West okay and either way whether
 

53
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,230
brought West okay and either way whether
the feet keep going or whether it bends

54
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,240
the feet keep going or whether it bends
 

55
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,910
the feet keep going or whether it bends
here

56
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:30,920
here
 

57
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,030
here
and then they do the step back back

58
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
and then they do the step back back
 

59
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,910
and then they do the step back back

or sorry rear roll whatever none of that
stuff is what we want to do because

00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
stuff is what we want to do because
 

67
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,670
stuff is what we want to do because
they're coming from west to east and we

68
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
they're coming from west to east and we
 

69
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,270
they're coming from west to east and we
pushing that head back from east to west

70
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
pushing that head back from east to west
 

71
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,190
pushing that head back from east to west
so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want

72
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want
 

73
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,350
so that's a y y Clash okay we don't want
to do that so if uh this is where the

74
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
to do that so if uh this is where the
 

75
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,590
to do that so if uh this is where the
heaven arm would be what we want to do

76
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
heaven arm would be what we want to do
 

77
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,910
heaven arm would be what we want to do
instead is we know for the head to

brought on that Circle the Kay Circle so

84
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
brought on that Circle the Kay Circle so
 

85
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,430
brought on that Circle the Kay Circle so
that its forward inertia is maintained

86

this Loop sometimes I refer to it as

110
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
this Loop sometimes I refer to it as
 

111
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,630
this Loop sometimes I refer to it as
it's like kotes on the head like a lot

112
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
it's like kotes on the head like a lot
 

113

of people will do it on kesi but they
 

115
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,789
of people will do it on kesi but they
don't do it on any of the other throws

116

teni nugget Ed nugget C hole but it's

118
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
teni nugget Ed nugget C hole but it's
 

119
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,550
teni nugget Ed nugget C hole but it's
the same you do it the same way so think

120
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
the same you do it the same way so think
 

121
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,830
the same you do it the same way so think
of it that way the head is going to go

122
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:14,840
of it that way the head is going to go
 

123
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,270
of it that way the head is going to go
forward on this Loop like this

124
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
forward on this Loop like this
 

125
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,630
forward on this Loop like this
okay um and then what happens is uh now

126
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:23,640
okay um and then what happens is uh now
 

127
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,750
okay um and then what happens is uh now
I'm not fighting it cuz now it's inertia

128
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm not fighting it cuz now it's inertia
 

129
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,429
I'm not fighting it cuz now it's inertia
is

130
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:27,439
is
 

131
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,309
is
going uh West even though know the

132
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
going uh West even though know the
 

133
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,789
going uh West even though know the
body's coming east okay and now what I

134
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:33,799
body's coming east okay and now what I
 

135
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,630
body's coming east okay and now what I
have to do is help make the feet light

136
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:37,640
have to do is help make the feet light
 

137
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,149
have to do is help make the feet light
okay and the way you do that is you now

138
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:41,159
okay and the way you do that is you now
 

139
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,910
okay and the way you do that is you now
bring the head this

140
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:42,920
bring the head this
 

141
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,910
bring the head this
way okay your hip's going to go in

142
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920

 

143
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,149

here crap all right you're going to go

144
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
here crap all right you're going to go
 

145
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,789
here crap all right you're going to go
this way you make that little Loop and

146
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
this way you make that little Loop and
 

147
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,990
this way you make that little Loop and
now you come this

148
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
now you come this
 

149
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,630
now you come this
way then your hip goes in here

150
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
way then your hip goes in here
 

151
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,229
way then your hip goes in here
and this part starts to now fol them

152
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
and this part starts to now fol them
 

153
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,069
and this part starts to now fol them
around this way and as the feet are

154
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:08,079
around this way and as the feet are
 

155
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,990
around this way and as the feet are
lifting the head is getting light so the

156
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,000
lifting the head is getting light so the
 

157
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,509
lifting the head is getting light so the
head we know is going down but I'm not

158
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
head we know is going down but I'm not
 

159
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,789
head we know is going down but I'm not
actually throwing it down it's more I

160
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:15,799
actually throwing it down it's more I
 

161
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,629
actually throwing it down it's more I
pick the feet up and I help pick the

162
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
pick the feet up and I help pick the
 

163
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,030
pick the feet up and I help pick the
feet up by moving the head this way and

164
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
feet up by moving the head this way and
 

165
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,350
feet up by moving the head this way and
then eventually that head Falls over on

166
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,360
then eventually that head Falls over on
 

167
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,550
then eventually that head Falls over on
this side okay so let's film it from

168
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,560
this side okay so let's film it from
 

169
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,469
this side okay so let's film it from
over

170
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
over
 

171
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,310
over
here see you can see more of the angles

172
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
here see you can see more of the angles
 

173
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
here see you can see more of the angles
the head is going forward it's going to

174
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
the head is going forward it's going to
 

175
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,310
the head is going forward it's going to
do that

176
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
do that
 

177
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,110
do that
kotes on the head now the forward

178
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
kotes on the head now the forward
 

179
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,749
kotes on the head now the forward
inertia is going rearward okay then I

180
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:42,759
inertia is going rearward okay then I
 

181
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,990
inertia is going rearward okay then I
got to get weight off the feet and so I

182
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
got to get weight off the feet and so I
 

183
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,390
got to get weight off the feet and so I
bring the head this way with my hip over

184
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
bring the head this way with my hip over
 

185
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,189
bring the head this way with my hip over
here the head goes this way the feet go

186
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
here the head goes this way the feet go
 

187
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,390
here the head goes this way the feet go
that way and the feet start to lower the

188
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
that way and the feet start to lower the
 

189
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,550
that way and the feet start to lower the
head and the guy falls down okay one

190
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
head and the guy falls down okay one
 

191
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,510
head and the guy falls down okay one
more time this way on the head then back

192
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
more time this way on the head then back
 

193
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,790
more time this way on the head then back
this way Hip is over here it'll lighten

194
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
this way Hip is over here it'll lighten
 

195
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,870
this way Hip is over here it'll lighten
the feet the feet will come around as I

196
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
the feet the feet will come around as I
 

197
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,150
the feet the feet will come around as I
keep guiding the head around my body and

198
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,160
keep guiding the head around my body and
 

199
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,310
keep guiding the head around my body and
the guy falls down

200
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,320
the guy falls down
 

201
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,950
the guy falls down
okay not doing

202
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:15,960
okay not doing
 

203
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,710
okay not doing
this like that

204
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
this like that
 

205
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,430
this like that
okay so let's look at some of the more

206
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
okay so let's look at some of the more
 

207
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,070
okay so let's look at some of the more
common ways that

208
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
common ways that
 

209
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,830
common ways that
people um mistakenly end up Yong Yong

210
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
people um mistakenly end up Yong Yong
 

211
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,189
people um mistakenly end up Yong Yong
clashing that means that they're coming

212
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
clashing that means that they're coming
 

213
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,550
clashing that means that they're coming
this way and you just took energy uh in

214
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
this way and you just took energy uh in
 

215
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,510
this way and you just took energy uh in
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so

216
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so
 

217
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,469
100 uh 180° opposition to them okay so
we'll do that

218
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
we'll do that
 

219
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,710
we'll do that
now okay uh let's go over

220
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:47,720
now okay uh let's go over
 

221
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,350
now okay uh let's go over
here so probably the most common way is

222
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
here so probably the most common way is
 

223
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,270
here so probably the most common way is
we'll just look at the earthand is the

224
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,280
we'll just look at the earthand is the
 

225
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,350
we'll just look at the earthand is the
earth hand the person's coming in and

226
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
earth hand the person's coming in and
 

227
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,550
earth hand the person's coming in and
then we pull it this way

228
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,560
then we pull it this way
 

229
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,870
then we pull it this way
okay so this hand looks like

230
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
okay so this hand looks like
 

231
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,110
okay so this hand looks like
this

232
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
this
 

233
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,029
this
okay uh a lot of people are thinking

234
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
okay uh a lot of people are thinking
 

235
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,189
okay uh a lot of people are thinking
that you're going to shove that down

236
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
that you're going to shove that down
 

237
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,230
that you're going to shove that down
like that and then you have now shaku

238
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
like that and then you have now shaku
 

239
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,270
like that and then you have now shaku
and then you enter into

240
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280

 

241
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,390

it but what happens is is when you when

242
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
it but what happens is is when you when
 

243
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,390
it but what happens is is when you when
you pull this thing around like that you

244
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:27,400
you pull this thing around like that you
 

245
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,909
you pull this thing around like that you
can see the pull I'm doing on his

246
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
can see the pull I'm doing on his
 

247
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,390
can see the pull I'm doing on his
shoulder so I'm just demonstrated it

248
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
shoulder so I'm just demonstrated it
 

249
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,189
shoulder so I'm just demonstrated it
from this angle

250
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
from this angle
 

251
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,950
from this angle
okay

252
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
okay
 

253
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,629
okay
okay and so now that

254
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
okay and so now that
 

255
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,510
okay and so now that
shoulder is coming back which means that

256
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
shoulder is coming back which means that
 

257
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,870
shoulder is coming back which means that
other shoulder is coming forward and you

258
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
other shoulder is coming forward and you
 

259
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,469
other shoulder is coming forward and you
can see how it sets them up for that

260
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:47,479
can see how it sets them up for that
 

261
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,110
can see how it sets them up for that
turn that you have uh that problem with

262
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,120

 

263
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,909

okay which means if he wants to he could

264
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
okay which means if he wants to he could
 

265
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,990
okay which means if he wants to he could
take that turn

266
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
take that turn
 

267
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,710
take that turn
you

268
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:01,720
you
 

269
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,390
you
see and that's that's the problem so I'm

270
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
see and that's that's the problem so I'm
 

271
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,830
see and that's that's the problem so I'm
contesting on the grib and now I made it

272
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
contesting on the grib and now I made it
 

273
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,469
contesting on the grib and now I made it
possible for the UK who wants to turn to

274
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
possible for the UK who wants to turn to
 

275
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,589
possible for the UK who wants to turn to
turn

276
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:14,599
turn
 

277
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,270
turn
okay it goes this

278
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,280
okay it goes this
 

279
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,710
okay it goes this
way and it doesn't matter if I

280
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720

 

281
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,869

enter and do it every time okay so what

282
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:27,879
enter and do it every time okay so what
 

283
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,469
enter and do it every time okay so what
we want to do on this hand is not go

284
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
we want to do on this hand is not go
 

285
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,430
we want to do on this hand is not go
this

286
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
this
 

287
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,430
this
way it's going to help with that pattern

288
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:36,440
way it's going to help with that pattern
 

289
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,230
way it's going to help with that pattern
so I showed the pattern on this side so

290
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
so I showed the pattern on this side so
 

291
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,909
so I showed the pattern on this side so
we'll do it on this side okay he's going

292
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:40,919
we'll do it on this side okay he's going
 

293
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,629
we'll do it on this side okay he's going
to go

294
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:43,639
to go
 

295
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,830
to go
in and then around me this way

296
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:48,840
in and then around me this way
 

297
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,710
in and then around me this way
okay so if we look at certain things

298
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
okay so if we look at certain things
 

299
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,909
okay so if we look at certain things
one when I do this

300
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
one when I do this
 

301
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,749
one when I do this
hand and I go here like that we want to

302
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
hand and I go here like that we want to
 

303
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,350
hand and I go here like that we want to
look at where his foot is to my hip it's

304
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
look at where his foot is to my hip it's
 

305
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,550
look at where his foot is to my hip it's
way over

306
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,560
way over
 

307
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,149
way over
there and we want to bring him more in

308
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:09,159
there and we want to bring him more in
 

309
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:20,749
there and we want to bring him more in
past my hip and that's where that hand

310
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:20,759

 

311
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,550

drops I want him past my

312
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,560

 

313
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,589

head and that's where this leg comes in

314
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:30,599
head and that's where this leg comes in
 

315
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,230
head and that's where this leg comes in
now this now brings his head this

316
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240

 

317
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,870

way this way not this

318
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880

 

319
00:08:44,880 --> 00:09:00,350

way let him pass you and then you enter

320
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,360

 

321
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,829

when you cut this arm down don't pull it

322
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
when you cut this arm down don't pull it
 

323
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,230
when you cut this arm down don't pull it
you're just guiding it it's very light

324
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,240
you're just guiding it it's very light
 

325
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,910
you're just guiding it it's very light
here that's how you know when to drop it

326
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:10,920
here that's how you know when to drop it
 

327
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,269
here that's how you know when to drop it
when you don't feel his energy on it

328
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
when you don't feel his energy on it

this foot is your my foot so you decide

338
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
this foot is your my foot so you decide
 

339
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,069
this foot is your my foot so you decide
where it goes to allow all that to

340
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:39,079
where it goes to allow all that to
 

341
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,990
where it goes to allow all that to
happen you kind go

342
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,000

she has that 180 degree oppositional
 

357
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,870
she has that 180 degree oppositional
mindset you can

358
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880

okay so a lot of times just like on the
 

515
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,949
okay so a lot of times just like on the
earth hand uh people bring it only a

516
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:55,959
earth hand uh people bring it only a
 

517

earth hand uh people bring it only a
little bit where his foot's not over

518
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:58,279
little bit where his foot's not over
 

519
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,949
little bit where his foot's not over
here and then they start bringing it

520
00:14:59,949 --> 00:14:59,959
here and then they start bringing it
 

521
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,470
here and then they start bringing it
back here the same thing you get sub

522
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
back here the same thing you get sub
 

523
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,389
back here the same thing you get sub
opening but now it's going it's going

524
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
opening but now it's going it's going
 

525
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,749
opening but now it's going it's going
that way and it stops a person stops a

526
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:09,759
that way and it stops a person stops a
 

527
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,949
that way and it stops a person stops a
person and when it stops a person it

528
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
person and when it stops a person it
 

529
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,150
person and when it stops a person it
gives him a choice to turn on it and you

530
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
gives him a choice to turn on it and you
 

531
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,710
gives him a choice to turn on it and you
can do the forward

532
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
can do the forward
 

533
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,670
can do the forward
roll what we're trying to do is stop him

534
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
roll what we're trying to do is stop him
 

535
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,629
roll what we're trying to do is stop him
from being able to turn by preoccupying

536
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:25,639
from being able to turn by preoccupying
 

537
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,949
from being able to turn by preoccupying
his center with the forward

538
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:27,959
his center with the forward
 

539
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,150
his center with the forward
inertia it's hard to turn when your

540
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
inertia it's hard to turn when your
 

541
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,470
inertia it's hard to turn when your
Center is being pulled that way okay

542
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480
Center is being pulled that way okay
 

543
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,670
Center is being pulled that way okay
that's that's our our counter to the

544
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
that's that's our our counter to the
 

545
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,910
that's that's our our counter to the
turn all right so we work on this

546
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
turn all right so we work on this
 

547
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,189
turn all right so we work on this
hand and it's the inward spiral yes but

548
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
hand and it's the inward spiral yes but
 

549
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,710
hand and it's the inward spiral yes but
it wants to control the

550
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:47,720
it wants to control the
 

551
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,069
it wants to control the
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding

552
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding
 

553
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:59,949
elbow and this becomes as if I'm holding
here and I pull this forward

554
00:15:59,949 --> 00:15:59,959

 

555
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,910

here and I'm pulling it forward so he

556
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:02,920
here and I'm pulling it forward so he
 

557
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,269
here and I'm pulling it forward so he
keeps going

558
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:04,279
keeps going
 

559
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,470
keeps going
forward when you combine this elbow like

560
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,480
forward when you combine this elbow like
 

561
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,870
forward when you combine this elbow like
that and they're both pulling it's not

562
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
that and they're both pulling it's not
 

563
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,309
that and they're both pulling it's not
possible to turn cuz there's pulling

564
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:13,319
possible to turn cuz there's pulling
 

565
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,470
possible to turn cuz there's pulling
here try to turn it's pulling him that

566
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:17,480
here try to turn it's pulling him that
 

567
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,870
here try to turn it's pulling him that
way so we're going to just look at this

568
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:19,880
way so we're going to just look at this
 

569
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,829
way so we're going to just look at this
hand and this hand goes here and it

570
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
hand and this hand goes here and it
 

571
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,069
hand and this hand goes here and it
moves him back forward

572
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:29,079

 

573
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,350

and back this way that's what I mean

574
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,360
and back this way that's what I mean
 

575
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,230
and back this way that's what I mean
it's making him go

576
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,240
it's making him go
 

577
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,949
it's making him go
forward and it breaks him to here I

578
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
forward and it breaks him to here I
 

579
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,910

reconciled West East direction that he's
 

663
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,070
reconciled West East direction that he's
already folling that way okay without me

664
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,080
already folling that way okay without me
 

665
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:12,990
already folling that way okay without me
moving my hands from where he came

666
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,000

 

667
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,430

from okay try that part okay a second

668
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
from okay try that part okay a second
 

669
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,149

detail on this on the heaven hand okay

670
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
detail on this on the heaven hand okay
 

671
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,950
detail on this on the heaven hand okay
for him to

672
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:21,960
for him to
 

673
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,789
for him to
turn he can't have his head going the

674
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
turn he can't have his head going the
 

675
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,470
turn he can't have his head going the
other way so here would be a a a linear

676
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,480
other way so here would be a a a linear
 

677
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,390
other way so here would be a a a linear
energy against his chin and he's going

678
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
energy against his chin and he's going
 

679
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,390
energy against his chin and he's going
to turn this way the head the head is

680
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
to turn this way the head the head is
 

681
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,789
to turn this way the head the head is
now acting against that okay so when

682
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:37,799
now acting against that okay so when
 

683
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,909
now acting against that okay so when
he's in the heaven hand and he's she

684
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:40,919
he's in the heaven hand and he's she
 

685
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,830
he's in the heaven hand and he's she
like that and you can't you're throwing

686
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:42,840
like that and you can't you're throwing
 

687
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,270
like that and you can't you're throwing
him basically into the hand so he's

688
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
him basically into the hand so he's
 

689
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,950
him basically into the hand so he's
pressing into the hand okay it's not

690
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
pressing into the hand okay it's not
 

691
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,230
pressing into the hand okay it's not
it's not easy to turn your head that way

692
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
it's not easy to turn your head that way
 

693
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,029
it's not easy to turn your head that way
because even though I'm bringing his

694
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:54,039
because even though I'm bringing his
 

695
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:59,149
because even though I'm bringing his
head this way if you don't mind

696
00:20:59,149 --> 00:20:59,159
head this way if you don't mind
 

697
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,710
head this way if you don't mind
his linear inertia is pushing him into

698
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:01,720
his linear inertia is pushing him into
 

699
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,950
his linear inertia is pushing him into
my hand you see and as I move this way

700
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
my hand you see and as I move this way
 

701
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,950
my hand you see and as I move this way
it's difficult for him to turn his chin

702
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,960
it's difficult for him to turn his chin
 

703
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,510
it's difficult for him to turn his chin
in the direction do do you understand

704
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:10,520
in the direction do do you understand
 

705
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,750
in the direction do do you understand
that

706
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760

 

707
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,470

whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm

708
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm
 

709
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,110
whereas if I don't have him cuz I'm
pushing my head this way his forward

710
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
pushing my head this way his forward
 

711
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,269
pushing my head this way his forward
inertia he's going to yield to it by

712
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:21,279
inertia he's going to yield to it by
 

713
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,110
inertia he's going to yield to it by
turning and he's in the pivot okay so

714
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
turning and he's in the pivot okay so
 

715
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,230
turning and he's in the pivot okay so
I'm going to smash him into my arm arms

716
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm going to smash him into my arm arms
 

717
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,870
I'm going to smash him into my arm arms
boom and it makes it hard for him to

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:31,880
boom and it makes it hard for him to
 

719
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,789
boom and it makes it hard for him to
turn the chin and I don't need him to

720
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
turn the chin and I don't need him to
 

721
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,630
turn the chin and I don't need him to
not turn the chin ever I just need him

722
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:37,640
not turn the chin ever I just need him
 

723
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,710
not turn the chin ever I just need him
not to turn the chin long enough for me

724
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
not to turn the chin long enough for me

enter and I have him
 

731
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,149
enter and I have him
here I don't now try to throw his

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:53,159
here I don't now try to throw his
 

733
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,350
here I don't now try to throw his
head okay I have them like this I so go

734
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:56,360
head okay I have them like this I so go
 

735

to do
instead is as the weight is not on his

752
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
instead is as the weight is not on his
 

753
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,549
instead is as the weight is not on his
legs now and the inertia was coming

754
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
legs now and the inertia was coming
 

755
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,669
legs now and the inertia was coming
through on his Center

756
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:30,679

 

757
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,549

imagine here's his head I hold his head

758
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559

 

759
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,750

still camera over here you're going to

760
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,760
still camera over here you're going to
 

761
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,630
still camera over here you're going to
grab his Center this camera over here

762
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
grab his Center this camera over here
 

763
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,430
grab his Center this camera over here
this is what I'm working with this makes

764
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
this is what I'm working with this makes
 

765
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,230
this is what I'm working with this makes
his feet light and I can now make his

766
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,240
his feet light and I can now make his
 

767
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,789
his feet light and I can now make his
head light okay so when you gets to

768
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
head light okay so when you gets to
 

769
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,029
head light okay so when you gets to
where I want here this is where I'm

770
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
where I want here this is where I'm
 

771
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,310
where I want here this is where I'm
coming in and hitting this

772
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320

 

773
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,390

base as the base gets displaced his head

774
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
base as the base gets displaced his head
 

775
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,510
base as the base gets displaced his head
gets lighter and all I'm doing is

776
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
gets lighter and all I'm doing is
 

777
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,789
gets lighter and all I'm doing is
guiding it around me I'm not throwing

778
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:13,799
guiding it around me I'm not throwing
 

779
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,669
guiding it around me I'm not throwing
them down so I don't ever have to make

780
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:16,679
them down so I don't ever have to make
 

781
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,190
them down so I don't ever have to make
my arm go against that energy coming

782
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,200
my arm go against that energy coming
 

783
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:53,710
my arm go against that energy coming
west to east just around

784
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:53,720

 

785
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:21,110

787
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,590

okay so uh what I'm doing here is that

788
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:24,600
okay so uh what I'm doing here is that
 

789
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,269
okay so uh what I'm doing here is that
body lock concept we have a video on the

790
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
body lock concept we have a video on the
 

791
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,389
body lock concept we have a video on the
body lock Maybe more than one but it's

792
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:30,399
body lock Maybe more than one but it's
 

793
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,470
body lock Maybe more than one but it's
the only way I throw I only throw with

794
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
the only way I throw I only throw with
 

795
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,590
the only way I throw I only throw with
the body lock especially on the back

796
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
the body lock especially on the back
 

797
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,269
the body lock especially on the back
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a

798
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a
 

799
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,669
breakfall um as opposed to requiring a
hinge in the middle of his body like the

800
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
hinge in the middle of his body like the
 

801
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,350
hinge in the middle of his body like the
bonai does or uh the Federation at large

802
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
bonai does or uh the Federation at large
 

803
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,029
bonai does or uh the Federation at large
where they sit their butt down you see

804
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
where they sit their butt down you see
 

805
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,310
where they sit their butt down you see
that it has that hinge in the body still

806
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,320
that it has that hinge in the body still
 

807
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,990
that it has that hinge in the body still
is just going the other way than bonai

808
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
is just going the other way than bonai
 

809
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,789
is just going the other way than bonai
and uh none of that happens martially uh

810
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
and uh none of that happens martially uh
 

811
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,510
and uh none of that happens martially uh
people that are aggressing uh they will

812
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
people that are aggressing uh they will
 

813
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,789
people that are aggressing uh they will
lock their own body up uh and then with

814
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
lock their own body up uh and then with
 

815
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,070
lock their own body up uh and then with
inertia too the inertia acting on him

816
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,080
inertia too the inertia acting on him
 

817
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,149
inertia too the inertia acting on him
will lock the body up so all I have here

818
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
will lock the body up so all I have here
 

819
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,950
will lock the body up so all I have here
at this point with all that stuff I've

820
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:11,960
at this point with all that stuff I've
 

821
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,870
at this point with all that stuff I've
done with the tabaki the Ashi saaki the

822
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
done with the tabaki the Ashi saaki the
 

823
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,950
done with the tabaki the Ashi saaki the
yin yield the IE adhesion Etc is to

824
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:17,960
yin yield the IE adhesion Etc is to
 

825
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,990
yin yield the IE adhesion Etc is to
create a kind of rigidity on his body

826
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,000
create a kind of rigidity on his body
 

827
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,029
create a kind of rigidity on his body
that's what you want okay um you don't

828
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:24,039
that's what you want okay um you don't
 

829
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,310
that's what you want okay um you don't
want you don't want this okay and what

830
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
want you don't want this okay and what
 

831
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,590
want you don't want this okay and what
what I'm doing here is and I'll just go

832
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
what I'm doing here is and I'll just go
 

833
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,669
what I'm doing here is and I'll just go
see the video on the body lock okay but

834
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:34,679
see the video on the body lock okay but
 

835
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,669
see the video on the body lock okay but
there is the ademi angle where I can be

836
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
there is the ademi angle where I can be
 

837
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,070
there is the ademi angle where I can be
on the front top part of it like the

838
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
on the front top part of it like the
 

839
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,590
on the front top part of it like the
bulen and the bottom part back of it and

840
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
bulen and the bottom part back of it and
 

841
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,630
bulen and the bottom part back of it and
that's what you're throwing when you do

842
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:49,640
that's what you're throwing when you do
 

843
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,909
that's what you're throwing when you do
these techniques it's kind of I'm gaming

844
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
these techniques it's kind of I'm gaming
 

845
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,470
these techniques it's kind of I'm gaming
it here but instead of bending them

846
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
it here but instead of bending them
 

847
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,789
it here but instead of bending them
backwards and then he goes

848
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
backwards and then he goes
 

849
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,830
backwards and then he goes
you're kind of just hitting

850
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
you're kind of just hitting
 

851
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,830
you're kind of just hitting
here you want it to lock but your body

852
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:04,840
here you want it to lock but your body
 

853
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,230
here you want it to lock but your body
has to be in a certain place for that

854
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,240
has to be in a certain place for that
 

855
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,909
has to be in a certain place for that
okay and that I found even my dis you

856
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
okay and that I found even my dis you
 

857
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,430
okay and that I found even my dis you
don't quite get it as you go down in the

858
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:12,440
don't quite get it as you go down in the
 

859
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,630
don't quite get it as you go down in the
rank there's a place what they usually

860
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:15,640
rank there's a place what they usually
 

861
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,549

on the vertical plane here I'm not doing

884
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:50,679
on the vertical plane here I'm not doing
 

885
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,669
on the vertical plane here I'm not doing
that this has to coordinate with this

886
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
that this has to coordinate with this

displacement so that his body and lock

890
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
displacement so that his body and lock
 

891
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,350
displacement so that his body and lock
okay that's the body lock and that's in

892
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
okay that's the body lock and that's in
 

893
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,950
okay that's the body lock and that's in
the technique that also makes it very
