to move quickly
from the x you're going to be slower

360
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
from the x you're going to be slower
 

361
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,350
from the x you're going to be slower
if you don't lower your center of

gravity first
 

365
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,710
gravity first
so as you try to go like this this first

366
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
so as you try to go like this this first
 

367
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,309
so as you try to go like this this first
step is very slow

368
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
step is very slow
 

369
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,869
step is very slow
if you paid attention i did it on the

370
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
if you paid attention i did it on the
 

371
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,749
if you paid attention i did it on the
last drill

372
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
last drill
 

373
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,950
last drill
is i'm gonna drop my my weight

374
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
is i'm gonna drop my my weight
 

375
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,550
is i'm gonna drop my my weight
first that's the first thing i'm going

376
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
first that's the first thing i'm going
 

377
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,389
first that's the first thing i'm going
to do so if you watch

378
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
to do so if you watch
 

379
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,870
to do so if you watch
the uh the two men um

380
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
the uh the two men um
 

381
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,190
the uh the two men um
gu what we what you'll see is that a lot

382
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
gu what we what you'll see is that a lot
 

383
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,990
gu what we what you'll see is that a lot
i'll drop my

i'll drop my
 

385
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,070
i'll drop my
weight as opposed to just walking and

386
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
weight as opposed to just walking and
 

387
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,670
weight as opposed to just walking and
just walking you have to drop your

388
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
just walking you have to drop your
 

389
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,230
just walking you have to drop your
weight

390
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
weight
 

391
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,430
weight
in order to cut directions okay so

392
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
in order to cut directions okay so
 

393
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,949
in order to cut directions okay so
the first move is pull my drop my weight

394
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
the first move is pull my drop my weight
 

395
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,590
the first move is pull my drop my weight
and that is where i start taking off

396
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
and that is where i start taking off
 

397
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,030
and that is where i start taking off
okay

398
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
okay
 

399
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,630
okay
and just like the last drill there

400
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
and just like the last drill there
 

401
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,389
and just like the last drill there
should be no part of me that is not

402
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
should be no part of me that is not
 

403
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,590
should be no part of me that is not
already moving

404
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
already moving
 

405
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,230
already moving
and just like my body art everything is

406
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
and just like my body art everything is
 

407
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,430
and just like my body art everything is
always moving

408
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
always moving
 

409
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,230
always moving
but not necessarily on the same path or

410
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
but not necessarily on the same path or
 

411
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,590
but not necessarily on the same path or
at the same rate

412
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
at the same rate
 

413
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,470
at the same rate
okay but what i don't want to do is this

414
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
okay but what i don't want to do is this
 

415
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,829
okay but what i don't want to do is this
hand is here

416
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
hand is here
 

417
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,630
hand is here
like someone shot it with a dart okay

418
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
like someone shot it with a dart okay
 

419
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,910
like someone shot it with a dart okay
everything is moving

420
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
everything is moving
 

421
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,070
everything is moving
so i know where that hand wants to end

422
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
so i know where that hand wants to end
 

423
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,990
so i know where that hand wants to end
up and how it wants to end up

424
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
up and how it wants to end up
 

425
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,509
up and how it wants to end up
so it wants to get that master grip okay

426
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
so it wants to get that master grip okay
 

427
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,630
so it wants to get that master grip okay
so i i'm working it towards that

428
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
so i i'm working it towards that
 

429
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,670
so i i'm working it towards that
um so i'm moving boom

430
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
um so i'm moving boom
 

431
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,550
um so i'm moving boom
and around

432
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560

 

433
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,070

i'll do the other one from the other

434
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
i'll do the other one from the other
 

435
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,829
i'll do the other one from the other
side again on this

436
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
side again on this
 

437
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,790
side again on this
arc i'm going to my support side so

438
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
arc i'm going to my support side so
 

439
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,230
arc i'm going to my support side so
you're going to find it

440
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
you're going to find it
 

441
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,710
you're going to find it
much more beneficial to keep the master

442
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
much more beneficial to keep the master
 

443
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,310
much more beneficial to keep the master
grip

444
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
grip
 

445
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,670
grip
not in place until the end so i'm moving

446
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680

 

447
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,630

and again if i do the other one you're

448
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
and again if i do the other one you're
 

449
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,430
and again if i do the other one you're
going to get this weird sweep

450
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
going to get this weird sweep
 

451
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,230
going to get this weird sweep
so bring that gun up to the fastest side

452
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
so bring that gun up to the fastest side
 

453
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,949
so bring that gun up to the fastest side
picture

454
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
picture
 

455
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:28,069
picture
that you can

456
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079

 

457
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,990

okay okay now

458
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
okay okay now
 

459
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,069
okay okay now
let's go back to the first micro drill

460
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
let's go back to the first micro drill
 

461
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,630
let's go back to the first micro drill
something's in my hand though okay this

462
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
something's in my hand though okay this
 

463
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,870
something's in my hand though okay this
is just representative of

464
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
is just representative of
 

465
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,949
is just representative of
anything it might be it might be your

466
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
anything it might be it might be your
 

467
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,030
anything it might be it might be your
flashlight might be your pen might be

468
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
flashlight might be your pen might be
 

469
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,389
flashlight might be your pen might be
your citation book

470
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
your citation book
 

471
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,910
your citation book
it doesn't matter okay

472
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920

 

473
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,470

what happens under stress is the kind of

474
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
what happens under stress is the kind of
 

475
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,470
what happens under stress is the kind of
sympathetic squeeze of this hand

476
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480

 

477
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,790

culturally you're often told don't have

478
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
culturally you're often told don't have
 

479
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,949
culturally you're often told don't have
anything in your gunman

480
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
anything in your gunman
 

481
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,230
anything in your gunman
but it's actually um the and the notion

482
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
but it's actually um the and the notion
 

483
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,190
but it's actually um the and the notion
there

484
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
there
 

485
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,110
there
is that you'll you're gonna draw it

486
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
is that you'll you're gonna draw it
 

487
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,110
is that you'll you're gonna draw it
okay so out of all the people that i

488
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
okay so out of all the people that i
 

489
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,990
okay so out of all the people that i
have trained i have never seen that

490
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
have trained i have never seen that
 

491
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,630
have trained i have never seen that
what i have seen is that they don't let

492
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
what i have seen is that they don't let
 

493
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,389
what i have seen is that they don't let
go of this thing

494
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
go of this thing
 

495
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,269
go of this thing
and they end up shooting one-handed

496
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
and they end up shooting one-handed
 

497
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,949
and they end up shooting one-handed
which is doable

498
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
which is doable
 

499
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,590
which is doable
but definitely it's going to reduce our

500
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
but definitely it's going to reduce our
 

501
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,190
but definitely it's going to reduce our
recoil mitigation

502
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
recoil mitigation
 

503
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,030
recoil mitigation
and therefore give us a worse ratio in

504
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
and therefore give us a worse ratio in
 

505
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,990
and therefore give us a worse ratio in
terms of

506
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
terms of
 

507
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,750
terms of
speed and accuracy okay so

508
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
speed and accuracy okay so
 

509
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,389
speed and accuracy okay so
it's because you have so many reps

510
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
it's because you have so many reps
 

511
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,990
it's because you have so many reps
already with the

512
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
already with the
 

513

okay so we have to get some reps in with
 

533
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,829

dropping the thing

534
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
dropping the thing
 

535
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,790
dropping the thing
okay and opening our hand and this

537
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,870
okay and opening our hand and this
happens naturally

538

position of the master grip
 

551
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,030
position of the master grip
okay but you need some reps in it to

552
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
okay but you need some reps in it to
 

553
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,030

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,030
okay all right this time the person's
doing the

686
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
doing the
 

687
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,790
doing the
the same kind of pressure let's start

688
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
the same kind of pressure let's start
 

689
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,150
the same kind of pressure let's start
like failure

690
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
like failure
 

691
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,189
like failure
okay so same kind of pressure okay

692
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
okay so same kind of pressure okay
 

693
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,710
okay so same kind of pressure okay
wow that's it

694
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720

 

695
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,990

and i'm just going to create a

696
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
and i'm just going to create a
 

697
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,069
and i'm just going to create a
deflection a deflection on her

698
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
deflection a deflection on her
 

699
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,110
deflection a deflection on her
she goes and now

700
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
she goes and now
 

701
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,269
she goes and now
now she is my pointer okay

702
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279

 

703
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,389

so i have the same stressor to test the

704
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
so i have the same stressor to test the
 

705
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,069
so i have the same stressor to test the
sympathetic squeeze

706
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
sympathetic squeeze
 

707
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,230
sympathetic squeeze
but i also have a form that i have to

708
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
but i also have a form that i have to
 

709
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:04,859
but i also have a form that i have to
find okay

710
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:04,869
find okay
 

711
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:15,710
find okay
[Music]

712
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:15,720

 

713
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720

okay
