I can lower it. After he passes me, pass

doesn't take much. Okay.

184
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920

 

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,509

Hold on. We got a question. Are you

186
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
Hold on. We got a question. Are you
 

187
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,070
Hold on. We got a question. Are you
using the coil for that? Yes. Yes.

188
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
using the coil for that? Yes. Yes.
 

189
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,750
using the coil for that? Yes. Yes.
That's all I have. I don't want to move

my feet. If I move my feet, I'm going to

192
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
my feet. If I move my feet, I'm going to
 

193
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,509

little to get the full yield. And then

204
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,630

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,749
So, all that we're doing now is project
projecting the guy away. Okay? If you

352
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
projecting the guy away. Okay? If you
 

353
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,910
projecting the guy away. Okay? If you
wanted to project him away, you would do

354
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
wanted to project him away, you would do
 

355
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,430
wanted to project him away, you would do
that. Okay? And then you could draw your

356
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
that. Okay? And then you could draw your
 

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,189
that. Okay? And then you could draw your
weapon. Good. He's off your wrist. Okay?

358
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
weapon. Good. He's off your wrist. Okay?
 

359
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,990
weapon. Good. He's off your wrist. Okay?
Um to get the top effect, we have to get

360
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
Um to get the top effect, we have to get
 

361
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,150
Um to get the top effect, we have to get
the head down. So, as the head comes

362
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
the head down. So, as the head comes
 

363
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,550
the head down. So, as the head comes
back up, the center goes out and heads

364
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
back up, the center goes out and heads
 

365
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,870
back up, the center goes out and heads
back up. Okay?

366
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
back up. Okay?
 

367
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,389
back up. Okay?
So,

368
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
So,
 

369
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,910
So,
you have to have your hat ready like

370
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
you have to have your hat ready like
 

371
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,230
you have to have your hat ready like
we've been doing. You know, the head

372
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
we've been doing. You know, the head
 

373
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,189
we've been doing. You know, the head
lowered initially, remember? So, don't

374
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
lowered initially, remember? So, don't
 

375
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,350
lowered initially, remember? So, don't
reach up for it. Just have it ready to

376
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
reach up for it. Just have it ready to
 

377
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,390
reach up for it. Just have it ready to
catch it. It's right there.

378
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
catch it. It's right there.
 

379
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,549
catch it. It's right there.
Got it?

380
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
Got it?
 

381
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,710
Got it?
Don't push it down cuz that would be

382
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
Don't push it down cuz that would be
 

383
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,549
Don't push it down cuz that would be
contesting. The head goes around you

384
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
contesting. The head goes around you
 

385
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,210

You see that? Okay. So, if you feel for
 

491
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,070
You see that? Okay. So, if you feel for
it, it would never come up because it

492

it, it would never come up because it
 

493
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,789
it, it would never come up because it
would feel very loose. Okay. Try it

push the center.
 

503
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,149

in mid-range grappling
they did this other thing. Why? Because

776
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:38,799
they did this other thing. Why? Because
 

777
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,389
they did this other thing. Why? Because
they have you. They cannot control the

778
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
they have you. They cannot control the
 

779

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
center from the this part of the body.
 

781
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,830
center from the this part of the body.
But once you have the internals, now you

782
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
But once you have the internals, now you
 

783
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,510
But once you have the internals, now you
can touch the center from this part of

784
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
can touch the center from this part of
 

785
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,230
can touch the center from this part of
the body. And now you're back to only

786
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
the body. And now you're back to only
 

787
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,750
the body. And now you're back to only
agency you have is how do you land?

788
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
agency you have is how do you land?
 

789
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,070
agency you have is how do you land?
Right? You might want to go and say,

790
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
Right? You might want to go and say,
 

791
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,070
Right? You might want to go and say,
"No, I have agency." Uh if in the middle

792
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
"No, I have agency." Uh if in the middle
 

793
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,990
"No, I have agency." Uh if in the middle
of the technique I try to do that. Well,

794
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
of the technique I try to do that. Well,
 

795
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,470
of the technique I try to do that. Well,
then we're not for training. We want to

796
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
then we're not for training. We want to
 

797
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,950
then we're not for training. We want to
do giwaza then the the no is going to do

798
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
do giwaza then the the no is going to do
 

799
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,990
do giwaza then the the no is going to do
gi waza back on there. So there is the

800
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
gi waza back on there. So there is the
 

801
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,269
gi waza back on there. So there is the
hammer fist to your face right or in

802
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,279
hammer fist to your face right or in
 

803
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,470
hammer fist to your face right or in
this in this um

804
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
this in this um
 

805
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,269
this in this um
this uh counter that I was telling you

806
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
this uh counter that I was telling you
 

807
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,310
this uh counter that I was telling you
cuz what what is happening is you have

808
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
cuz what what is happening is you have
 

809
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,430
cuz what what is happening is you have
the center and you're feeling it

810
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
the center and you're feeling it
 

811
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,230
the center and you're feeling it
dismantled right and so you're hyper yin

812
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
dismantled right and so you're hyper yin
 

813
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,870
dismantled right and so you're hyper yin
heal. You get it? Okay. So as you hyper

814
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
heal. You get it? Okay. So as you hyper
 

815
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,909
heal. You get it? Okay. So as you hyper
your heel, this hand that you've now

816
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
your heel, this hand that you've now
 

817
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,630
your heel, this hand that you've now
brought close to you will go directly on

818
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
brought close to you will go directly on
 

819
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,310
brought close to you will go directly on
the center. And now that is where the

820
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
the center. And now that is where the
 

821
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,950
the center. And now that is where the
coping projection hits you. So instead

822
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
coping projection hits you. So instead
 

823
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,630
coping projection hits you. So instead
of going through your arm or maybe if

824
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
of going through your arm or maybe if
 

825
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,950
of going through your arm or maybe if
you take a little shaving off of it,

826
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
you take a little shaving off of it,
 

827
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,870
you take a little shaving off of it,
there's no taking off anything and you

828
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
there's no taking off anything and you
 

829
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,310
there's no taking off anything and you
really you really go fly.

830
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
really you really go fly.
 

831
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,070
really you really go fly.

00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
and he feels the center, he feels that.
 

835
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,710
and he feels the center, he feels that.
hyper immune deals. It goes right to

836
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
hyper immune deals. It goes right to
 

837
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,070
hyper immune deals. It goes right to
there now. And that's where you have

838
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
there now. And that's where you have
 

839
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,590
there now. And that's where you have
projection. Okay. Um and again, no one

840
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
projection. Okay. Um and again, no one
 

841
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,230
projection. Okay. Um and again, no one
would ever know that that wasn't my

842
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,240
would ever know that that wasn't my
 

843
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,310
would ever know that that wasn't my
target all along. I'm just following the

844
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
target all along. I'm just following the
 

845
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,430
target all along. I'm just following the
unit space that he's given me. Okay. Um

846
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
unit space that he's given me. Okay. Um
 

847
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,669
unit space that he's given me. Okay. Um
we talked about following earlier. But

848
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
we talked about following earlier. But
 

849
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,830
we talked about following earlier. But
back to the UK.

850
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
back to the UK.
 

851
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,990
back to the UK.
Um that kind of is actually what it's

852
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
Um that kind of is actually what it's
 

853
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,630
Um that kind of is actually what it's
supposed to do when we look at the

854
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
supposed to do when we look at the
 

855
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,909
supposed to do when we look at the
marshall aspect. Yes, that that makes it

856
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
marshall aspect. Yes, that that makes it
 

857
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,389
marshall aspect. Yes, that that makes it
work because now the guy gets in a

858
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
work because now the guy gets in a
 

859
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,430
work because now the guy gets in a
dilemma. He has to get off of there

860
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
dilemma. He has to get off of there
 

861
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,149
dilemma. He has to get off of there
somehow. You see, there's only two ways.

862
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
somehow. You see, there's only two ways.
 

863
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,549
somehow. You see, there's only two ways.
He pulls out. He pulls out. Cool. I got

864
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
He pulls out. He pulls out. Cool. I got
 

865
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,710
He pulls out. He pulls out. Cool. I got
a weapon out. I got a weapon out. And we

866
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
a weapon out. I got a weapon out. And we
 

867
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,389
a weapon out. I got a weapon out. And we
don't have to drop over my weapon cuz

868
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
don't have to drop over my weapon cuz
 

869
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,590
don't have to drop over my weapon cuz
you gave space in time. Okay. Or he

870
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
you gave space in time. Okay. Or he
 

871
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,750
you gave space in time. Okay. Or he
hyper yin knees and it stays in place.

872
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
hyper yin knees and it stays in place.
 

873
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,990
hyper yin knees and it stays in place.
Cool. Now I go and do close-range

874
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
Cool. Now I go and do close-range
 

875
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,549
Cool. Now I go and do close-range
grappling on a guy who already lost his

876
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
grappling on a guy who already lost his
 

877
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,590
grappling on a guy who already lost his
balance and is trying to regain it.

878
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
balance and is trying to regain it.
 

879
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,230
balance and is trying to regain it.
or he had uh depending on where I am, he

880
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
or he had uh depending on where I am, he
 

881
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,310
or he had uh depending on where I am, he
goes hyper knee heels and I follow those

882
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
goes hyper knee heels and I follow those
 

883
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,950
goes hyper knee heels and I follow those
in and I'm into mid-range striking. You

884
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
in and I'm into mid-range striking. You
 

885
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,830
in and I'm into mid-range striking. You
get them right away.

886
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
get them right away.
 

887
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,149
get them right away.
Um but it all stems from I did have a

888
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
Um but it all stems from I did have a
 

889
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,230
Um but it all stems from I did have a
viable mid-range rack length because

890
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
viable mid-range rack length because
 

891
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,029
viable mid-range rack length because
from this part of his body I can still

892
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
from this part of his body I can still
 

893
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,350
from this part of his body I can still
control his center and therefore his

894
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
control his center and therefore his
 

895
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,870
control his center and therefore his
balance.

896
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880

 

897
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,909

But at the energetic level, obviously

898
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
But at the energetic level, obviously
 

899
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,710
But at the energetic level, obviously
that's it. There's no energetics in the

900
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
that's it. There's no energetics in the
 

901
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,269
that's it. There's no energetics in the
choreography. You're moving yourself.

902
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
choreography. You're moving yourself.
 

903
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,430
choreography. You're moving yourself.
I'm not moving you. So, how does it

904
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm not moving you. So, how does it
 

905
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,750
I'm not moving you. So, how does it
matter how I move and organize myself?

906
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
matter how I move and organize myself?
 

907
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,669
matter how I move and organize myself?
It doesn't. Which is why I can stand

908
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
It doesn't. Which is why I can stand
 

909
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,789
It doesn't. Which is why I can stand
straight up with my chin like that.

910
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:44,799

 

911
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,750

But then at the spiritual level,

912
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
But then at the spiritual level,
 

913
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,950
But then at the spiritual level,
the has to now unself because that just

914
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
the has to now unself because that just
 

915
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,430
the has to now unself because that just
 up. That's a up feeling.

916
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
up. That's a up feeling.
 

917
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,549
up. That's a up feeling.
You see the only way I can do this is

918
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:56,559
You see the only way I can do this is
 

919
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,190
You see the only way I can do this is
that I I did already. I've already

920
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
that I I did already. I've already
 

921
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,190
that I I did already. I've already
released itself and I allow this to

922
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
released itself and I allow this to
 

923
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,950
released itself and I allow this to
happen.

924
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
happen.
 

925
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,710
happen.
When I allow it to happen, I can

926
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
When I allow it to happen, I can
 

927
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,190
When I allow it to happen, I can
maintain consciousness through this top

928
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
maintain consciousness through this top
 

929
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,350
maintain consciousness through this top
spinning world that's happening and I

930
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
spinning world that's happening and I
 

931
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,389
spinning world that's happening and I
will find the map to spot.

932
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
will find the map to spot.
 

933
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,029
will find the map to spot.
But when I

934
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
But when I
 

935
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,789
But when I
have the self, I will lose that

936
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
have the self, I will lose that
 

937
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,190
have the self, I will lose that
universal speed of life awareness

938
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
universal speed of life awareness
 

939
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,190
universal speed of life awareness
because the ego tripartite mind cannot

940
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
because the ego tripartite mind cannot
 

941
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,350
because the ego tripartite mind cannot
function like that.

942
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
function like that.
 

943
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,269
function like that.
And now you grab for things and this is

944
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
And now you grab for things and this is
 

945
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,710
And now you grab for things and this is
maybe just making it worse. We laugh at

946
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
maybe just making it worse. We laugh at
 

947
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,590
maybe just making it worse. We laugh at
this freaking or the last second, you

948
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
this freaking or the last second, you
 

949
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,110
this freaking or the last second, you
know,

950
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
know,
 

951
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,190
know,
and then we get hurt. Now we take time

952
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
and then we get hurt. Now we take time
 

953
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,389
and then we get hurt. Now we take time
off.

954
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399

 

955
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,149

But now, as I said, the itself has an

956
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:42,159
But now, as I said, the itself has an
 

957
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,149
But now, as I said, the itself has an
unself aspect of it. Once we train like

958
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159
unself aspect of it. Once we train like
 

959
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,669
unself aspect of it. Once we train like
this and move ourselves away, no longer

960
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
this and move ourselves away, no longer
 

961
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,190
this and move ourselves away, no longer
having a need for

962
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
having a need for
 

963
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,070
having a need for
very very important. I don't I don't

964
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
very very important. I don't I don't
 

965
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,310
very very important. I don't I don't
know what to say. If I if I say Baki

966
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
know what to say. If I if I say Baki
 

967
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,029
know what to say. If I if I say Baki
yoga is very very important, it's the

968
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
yoga is very very important, it's the
 

969
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,669
yoga is very very important, it's the
same level of importance. Okay.

970
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679

 

971
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,430

All right. Any final questions, comments

972
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
All right. Any final questions, comments
 

973
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,790
All right. Any final questions, comments
on any of the training general

974
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
on any of the training general
 

975
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,190
on any of the training general
that anything on the training general?

976
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
that anything on the training general?
 

977
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,069
that anything on the training general?
just some of the themes that I've

978
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
just some of the themes that I've
 

979
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,190
just some of the themes that I've
noticed for myself. So first day just

980
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
noticed for myself. So first day just
 

981
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,669
noticed for myself. So first day just
doing this basic

982
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
doing this basic
 

983
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,669
doing this basic
experience of how one loses

984
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679
experience of how one loses
 

985
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,030
experience of how one loses
balance.

986
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040

 

987
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,909

Um what I noticed was feet becoming

988
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
Um what I noticed was feet becoming
 

989
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,349
Um what I noticed was feet becoming
tangled also often

990
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
tangled also often
 

991
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,470
tangled also often
feet.

992
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480

 

993
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,270

Yeah. So and it was very subtle. I was

994
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
Yeah. So and it was very subtle. I was
 

995
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,629
Yeah. So and it was very subtle. I was
very aware of it and I noticed

996
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
very aware of it and I noticed
 

997
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,990
very aware of it and I noticed
um maybe let's go by that the mindset.

998
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,000
um maybe let's go by that the mindset.
 

999
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,950
um maybe let's go by that the mindset.
Okay, but continue. So feet like this

1000
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
Okay, but continue. So feet like this
 

1001
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,950
Okay, but continue. So feet like this
feet entanglement but Naga's feet are

1002
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
feet entanglement but Naga's feet are
 

1003
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,030
feet entanglement but Naga's feet are
always ready to take advantage or to

1004
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
always ready to take advantage or to
 

1005
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,870
always ready to take advantage or to
utilize that feet entanglement. Yeah. So

1006
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
utilize that feet entanglement. Yeah. So
 

1007
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,950
utilize that feet entanglement. Yeah. So
just the feeling of feet entanglement

1008
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
just the feeling of feet entanglement
 

1009
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,550
just the feeling of feet entanglement
stumbling

1010
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
stumbling
 

1011
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,270
stumbling
kind of an unusual feeling for Iikido in

1012
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
kind of an unusual feeling for Iikido in
 

1013
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,190
kind of an unusual feeling for Iikido in
general and scary. Yeah. just even that

1014
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,200
general and scary. Yeah. just even that
 

1015
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,550
general and scary. Yeah. just even that
even subtle, you know, when we did the

1016
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,560
even subtle, you know, when we did the
 

1017
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,630
even subtle, you know, when we did the
adhesion and pull to the side. Yeah.

1018
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
adhesion and pull to the side. Yeah.
 

1019
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,750
adhesion and pull to the side. Yeah.
Really subtle. And immediately I noticed

1020
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
Really subtle. And immediately I noticed
 

1021
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,829
Really subtle. And immediately I noticed
when it came my turn to do it, I was

1022
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
when it came my turn to do it, I was
 

1023
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,190
when it came my turn to do it, I was
giving them the pass like instinctively

1024
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
giving them the pass like instinctively
 

1025
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,910
giving them the pass like instinctively
like I won't do that to you. Yes. Cuz I

1026
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
like I won't do that to you. Yes. Cuz I
 

1027
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,390
like I won't do that to you. Yes. Cuz I
don't want it done to me. Yes. No. I

1028
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
don't want it done to me. Yes. No. I
 

1029
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,670
don't want it done to me. Yes. No. I
That's me. Exactly. Now go back. Let's

1030
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
That's me. Exactly. Now go back. Let's
 

1031
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,310
That's me. Exactly. Now go back. Let's
keep that thought. How many times did I

1032
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
keep that thought. How many times did I
 

1033
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,550
keep that thought. How many times did I
actually address that repeatedly?

1034
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:42,560
actually address that repeatedly?
 

1035
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:55,190
actually address that repeatedly?
because I this is very common. Um

1036
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200

 

1037
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,390

I think it's part of the culture that

1038
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
I think it's part of the culture that
 

1039
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,190
I think it's part of the culture that
we're all raised in. There's a long

1040
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,200
we're all raised in. There's a long
 

1041
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,510
we're all raised in. There's a long
history to make us

1042
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
history to make us
 

1043
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,870
history to make us
um abhore violence.

1044
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
um abhore violence.
 

1045
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,670
um abhore violence.
There's a long history of it. Uh there's

1046
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
There's a long history of it. Uh there's
 

1047
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,349
There's a long history of it. Uh there's
a long history that our nation state

1048
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
a long history that our nation state
 

1049
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,230
a long history that our nation state
governments monopolize violence that

1050
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
governments monopolize violence that
 

1051
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,109
governments monopolize violence that
everyone else is criminal for being

1052
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
everyone else is criminal for being
 

1053
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,270
everyone else is criminal for being
violent. You have to understand that

1054
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
violent. You have to understand that
 

1055
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,670
violent. You have to understand that
much for most of human history that was

1056
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:25,680
much for most of human history that was
 

1057
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,270
much for most of human history that was
not the world. So for example

1058
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
not the world. So for example
 

1059
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,950
not the world. So for example
um you know how in the classroom in the

1060
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
um you know how in the classroom in the
 

1061
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,829
um you know how in the classroom in the
classroom we all went to school at uh

1062
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
classroom we all went to school at uh
 

1063
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,069
classroom we all went to school at uh
all our desks were lined up in lines

1064
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
all our desks were lined up in lines
 

1065
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,190
all our desks were lined up in lines
right? remember that

1066
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200
right? remember that
 

1067
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,910
right? remember that
and the state and the the teacher was up

1068
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
and the state and the the teacher was up
 

1069
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,349
and the state and the the teacher was up
front. Now we today think that that was

1070
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
front. Now we today think that that was
 

1071
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,310
front. Now we today think that that was
about that's about well that way we can

1072
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320
about that's about well that way we can
 

1073
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,670
about that's about well that way we can
all focus on the teacher. Okay. But

1074
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
all focus on the teacher. Okay. But
 

1075
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,550
all focus on the teacher. Okay. But
um Fukose's work was done on this. Okay.

1076
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
um Fukose's work was done on this. Okay.
 

1077
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,349
um Fukose's work was done on this. Okay.
And you trace it to it. It has to do

1078
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
And you trace it to it. It has to do
 

1079
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,069
And you trace it to it. It has to do
with surveillance. The per one person

1080
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
with surveillance. The per one person
 

1081
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,190
with surveillance. The per one person
can now watch a lot of people. Okay. and

1082
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,200
can now watch a lot of people. Okay. and
 

1083
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,349
can now watch a lot of people. Okay. and
you trace it back and you see the same

1084
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
you trace it back and you see the same
 

1085
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,589
you trace it back and you see the same
kind of system is in the prisons and the

1086
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
kind of system is in the prisons and the
 

1087
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,150
kind of system is in the prisons and the
jails where you can't have as many

1088
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
jails where you can't have as many
 

1089
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,790
jails where you can't have as many
guards as you have prisoners. So you

1090
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:16,800
guards as you have prisoners. So you
 

1091
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,550
guards as you have prisoners. So you
have to control space and you have to

1092
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
have to control space and you have to
 

1093
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,270
have to control space and you have to
survey uh that the space is being

1094
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
survey uh that the space is being
 

1095
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,510
survey uh that the space is being
controlled the whole time. But that went

1096
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
controlled the whole time. But that went
 

1097
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,829
controlled the whole time. But that went
back originally to the military

1098
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
back originally to the military
 

1099
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,829
back originally to the military
formations because early on

1100
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:29,839
formations because early on
 

1101
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,870
formations because early on
people would kind of fight independent

1102
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
people would kind of fight independent
 

1103
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,310
people would kind of fight independent
like a tribe and you would have

1104
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
like a tribe and you would have
 

1105
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,790
like a tribe and you would have
one-on-one. We know from our own arts

1106
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,800
one-on-one. We know from our own arts
 

1107
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,710
one-on-one. We know from our own arts
history, the samurai fought more

1108
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
history, the samurai fought more
 

1109
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,829
history, the samurai fought more
oneon-one, you see,

1110
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:41,839
oneon-one, you see,
 

1111
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,630
oneon-one, you see,
and much of Europe did. Even the Romans

1112
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
and much of Europe did. Even the Romans
 

1113
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,550
and much of Europe did. Even the Romans
were the first ones to and and the

1114
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
were the first ones to and and the
 

1115
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,069
were the first ones to and and the
Greeks were the first ones to really

1116
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
Greeks were the first ones to really
 

1117
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,710
Greeks were the first ones to really
organize themselves in this unit. But

1118
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
organize themselves in this unit. But
 

1119
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,710
organize themselves in this unit. But
even then,

1120
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
even then,
 

1121
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,270
even then,
they would have different groups as you

1122
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
they would have different groups as you
 

1123
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,109
they would have different groups as you
would be working around.

1124
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119

 

1125
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,390

Then Rome disappears.

1126
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
Then Rome disappears.
 

1127
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,430
Then Rome disappears.
uh Europe is borrowing some Roman

1128
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
uh Europe is borrowing some Roman
 

1129
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,430
uh Europe is borrowing some Roman
military technology in terms of

1130
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
military technology in terms of
 

1131
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,390
military technology in terms of
strategy, but they're coming from more

1132
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
strategy, but they're coming from more
 

1133
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,829
strategy, but they're coming from more
of the hordes that the Romans conquered.

1134
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
of the hordes that the Romans conquered.
 

1135
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,790
of the hordes that the Romans conquered.
It wasn't really it regimented like we

1136
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
It wasn't really it regimented like we
 

1137
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,870
It wasn't really it regimented like we
understand now where the British

1138
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
understand now where the British
 

1139
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,829
understand now where the British
colonial soldiers are walking until the

1140
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
colonial soldiers are walking until the
 

1141
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,510
colonial soldiers are walking until the
these nation states decided to hand

1142
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
these nation states decided to hand
 

1143
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,310
these nation states decided to hand
everybody a gun.

1144
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
everybody a gun.
 

1145
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,670
everybody a gun.
Prior to that, you were of the wealthier

1146
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:31,680
Prior to that, you were of the wealthier
 

1147
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,069
Prior to that, you were of the wealthier
class that you could afford armor and a

1148
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
class that you could afford armor and a
 

1149
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,710
class that you could afford armor and a
horse, right? And so you were that class

1150
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
horse, right? And so you were that class
 

1151
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,910
horse, right? And so you were that class
was fighting for that class economic

1152
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
was fighting for that class economic
 

1153
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,829
was fighting for that class economic
dominance, but quickly with the rifle,

1154
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839
dominance, but quickly with the rifle,
 

1155
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,829
dominance, but quickly with the rifle,
you didn't need all that training and

1156
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:47,839
you didn't need all that training and
 

1157
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,750
you didn't need all that training and
all that funding.

1158
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760
all that funding.
 

1159
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,550
all that funding.
And we could start giving it to peasants

1160
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
And we could start giving it to peasants
 

1161
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,230
And we could start giving it to peasants
and farmers. Same thing happened in

1162
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
and farmers. Same thing happened in
 

1163
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,750
and farmers. Same thing happened in
Japan. And it was a big question.

1164
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
Japan. And it was a big question.
 

1165
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,990
Japan. And it was a big question.
What if they turn these rifles on us

1166
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
What if they turn these rifles on us
 

1167
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,390
What if they turn these rifles on us
because we are controlling them all the

1168
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
because we are controlling them all the
 

1169
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,589
because we are controlling them all the
time. Well, we'll line them up.

1170
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
time. Well, we'll line them up.
 

1171
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,910
time. Well, we'll line them up.
That's where that came from. Line them

1172
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
That's where that came from. Line them
 

1173
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,069
That's where that came from. Line them
up so we can see which one is doing

1174
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
up so we can see which one is doing
 

1175
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,829
up so we can see which one is doing
something different than what we need

1176
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
something different than what we need
 

1177
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,990
something different than what we need
them to do. And that is what made its

1178
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
them to do. And that is what made its
 

1179
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,430
them to do. And that is what made its
way into prisons and into the

1180
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,440
way into prisons and into the
 

1181
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,589
way into prisons and into the
classrooms.

1182
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
classrooms.
 

1183
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,349
classrooms.
The way cities are all graded and

1184
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
The way cities are all graded and
 

1185
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,990
The way cities are all graded and
everything like that.

1186
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,000
everything like that.
 

1187
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,750
everything like that.
But along with that inertia is to is

1188
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
But along with that inertia is to is
 

1189
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,310
But along with that inertia is to is
also like

1190
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:28,320
also like
 

1191
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,030
also like
the government this violence is fine

1192
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
the government this violence is fine
 

1193
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,950
the government this violence is fine
when it's for the government. Violence

1194
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
when it's for the government. Violence
 

1195
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,550
when it's for the government. Violence
not for the government is not fine.

1196
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
not for the government is not fine.
 

1197
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,430
not for the government is not fine.
So in a lot of countries where you're in

1198
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
So in a lot of countries where you're in
 

1199
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,270
So in a lot of countries where you're in
you're not even allowed to carry a

1200
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
you're not even allowed to carry a
 

1201
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,190
you're not even allowed to carry a
weapon.

1202
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
weapon.
 

1203
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,589
weapon.
The United States has this long history

1204
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
The United States has this long history
 

1205
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,990
The United States has this long history
of the tyranny

1206
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
of the tyranny
 

1207
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,870
of the tyranny
of British colonialism where they were

1208
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
of British colonialism where they were
 

1209
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,870
of British colonialism where they were
having their weapons taken away from

1210
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:52,880
having their weapons taken away from
 

1211
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,670
having their weapons taken away from
them for these reasons and their

1212
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:55,680
them for these reasons and their
 

1213
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,990
them for these reasons and their
founding fathers said no that seemed to

1214
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
founding fathers said no that seemed to
 

1215
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,470
founding fathers said no that seemed to
be the gateway to the hell we got

1216
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480
be the gateway to the hell we got
 

1217
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,150
be the gateway to the hell we got
ourselves into. And

1218
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
ourselves into. And
 

1219
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,310
ourselves into. And
this is why America still has this kind

1220
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,320
this is why America still has this kind
 

1221
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,190
this is why America still has this kind
of cowboy spirit. Okay.

1222
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,200
of cowboy spirit. Okay.
 

1223
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,870
of cowboy spirit. Okay.
But there's still a big push in the

1224
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
But there's still a big push in the
 

1225
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,710
But there's still a big push in the
United States. No, no, no. You don't

Why do you need a gun? The already you

1230
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
Why do you need a gun? The already you
 

1231
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,829
Why do you need a gun? The already you
see the culturation that only the

1232

see the culturation that only the
 

1233
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,030
see the culturation that only the
government needs guns.

1234
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,040
government needs guns.
 

1235
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,589
government needs guns.
You you you repeat the founding father's

1236
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
You you you repeat the founding father's
 

1237
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,230
You you you repeat the founding father's
rationale that you need a gun because

1238
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,240
rationale that you need a gun because
 

1239
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,270
rationale that you need a gun because
the government can do this to you. Why

00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
would the government do that to You see
 

1243
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,990
would the government do that to You see
the totally a a history has taken place

1244
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
the totally a a history has taken place
 

1245
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,109
the totally a a history has taken place
that has moved us away from the founding

1246
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
that has moved us away from the founding
 

1247
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,349
that has moved us away from the founding
fathers experience that governments do

1248
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
fathers experience that governments do
 

1249
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,270
fathers experience that governments do
tyrannical things to people. Okay now no

weird way

1254
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000

 

1255
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,309

and now violence and the tools of

1256
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
and now violence and the tools of

put it down there on the nightstand. And

1276
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,109
bathroom cuz the other ones were the the

00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
nightstand is by the headboard. Do you
 

1285
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,270
nightstand is by the headboard. Do you
know the the door the bathroom's that

1286
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
know the the door the bathroom's that
 

1287
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,910
know the the door the bathroom's that
way? She turned and looked and sort of

1288
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
way? She turned and looked and sort of
 

1289
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,630
way? She turned and looked and sort of
started shaking because it looks like it

1290
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
started shaking because it looks like it
 

1291
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,069
started shaking because it looks like it
does not look like a chef knife. You

1292
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
does not look like a chef knife. You
 

1293
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,950
does not look like a chef knife. You
know what I mean? It was it it started

1294
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
know what I mean? It was it it started
 

1295
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,870
know what I mean? It was it it started
like really getting her. We're from the

1296
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
like really getting her. We're from the
 

1297
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,309
like really getting her. We're from the
same family, but we have a different

1298
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
same family, but we have a different
 

1299
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,109
same family, but we have a different
path. And this triggered the the

1300
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
path. And this triggered the the
 

1301
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,990
path. And this triggered the the
response. I see this response all the

1302
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
response. I see this response all the
 

1303
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,230
response. I see this response all the
time, too. When we get recruits who've

1304
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
time, too. When we get recruits who've
 

1305
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,190
time, too. When we get recruits who've
never held a gun, it's it's already

1306
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
never held a gun, it's it's already
 

1307
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,109
never held a gun, it's it's already
charged with a power that brings in

1308
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
charged with a power that brings in
 

1309
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:14,950
charged with a power that brings in
anxiety.

1310
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:14,960

 

1311
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,630

Here too, we do a drill on the like one

1312
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
Here too, we do a drill on the like one
 

1313
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,030
Here too, we do a drill on the like one
of the ways we get close to the striking

1314
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
of the ways we get close to the striking
 

1315
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,349
of the ways we get close to the striking
and the relaxation.

1316
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:25,359
and the relaxation.
 

1317
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,990
and the relaxation.
is you have your hands behind your back

1318
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
is you have your hands behind your back
 

1319
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,910
is you have your hands behind your back
and they'll just hit you in the face

1320
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920
and they'll just hit you in the face
 

1321
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,750
and they'll just hit you in the face
over and over until you get used to

1322
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
over and over until you get used to
 

1323
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,030
over and over until you get used to
getting hit in the face.

1324
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
getting hit in the face.
 

1325
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,870
getting hit in the face.
And everyone's more fond of getting hit

1326
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
And everyone's more fond of getting hit
 

1327
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,030
And everyone's more fond of getting hit
in the face than it then you start have

1328
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
in the face than it then you start have
 

1329
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,630
in the face than it then you start have
people that don't want to hit the other

1330
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
people that don't want to hit the other
 

1331
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,270
people that don't want to hit the other
people in the face.

1332
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280

 

1333
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,630

I had him cry at trying to do it the way

1334
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
I had him cry at trying to do it the way
 

1335
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:57,750
I had him cry at trying to do it the way
my sister cried at trying to do that.

1336
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,760

 

1337
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,630

I've had recruits too and they do this

1338
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:00,640
I've had recruits too and they do this

1345
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,510
other after they exhaust each other
physically and then they have to do this

1346
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,520
physically and then they have to do this
 

1347
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,870
physically and then they have to do this
boxing uh and they we're looking for

1348
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880

quit.
 

1353
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,750
quit.
And you'll see again some people like

1354
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:21,760
And you'll see again some people like
 

1355
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,829
And you'll see again some people like
they'd rather get hit than hit the other

1356
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
they'd rather get hit than hit the other
 

1357
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,670
they'd rather get hit than hit the other
person.

1358
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680

 

1359
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,430

And for me, like I said, we're all just

1360
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
And for me, like I said, we're all just
 

1361
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,990
And for me, like I said, we're all just
fighting this history that made what was

1362
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
fighting this history that made what was
 

1363
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,550
fighting this history that made what was
once normal,

1364
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,560
once normal,
 

1365
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,030
once normal,
especially for a warrior.

1366
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
especially for a warrior.
 

1367
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,069
especially for a warrior.
We're in a warrior art, but somehow

1368
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079

 

1369
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,309

we don't have the warrior that warrior

1370
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
we don't have the warrior that warrior
 

1371
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,309
we don't have the warrior that warrior
comfortability, that warrior culture

1372
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
comfortability, that warrior culture
 

1373
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,710
comfortability, that warrior culture
where the weapons are not charged for

1374
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
where the weapons are not charged for
 

1375
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,109
where the weapons are not charged for
me, you know, with that emotional power.

1376
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119

 

1377
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,150

So, I would say first, yes, that's

1378
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
So, I would say first, yes, that's
 

1379
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,390
So, I would say first, yes, that's
probably more common than not. And it's

1380
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
probably more common than not. And it's
 

1381
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,190
probably more common than not. And it's
going to get more common as the modern

1382
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
going to get more common as the modern
 

1383
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,190
going to get more common as the modern
nation states do more and more to

1384
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
nation states do more and more to
 

1385
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,109
nation states do more and more to
monopolize violence. And um I would even

1386
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
monopolize violence. And um I would even
 

1387
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,390
monopolize violence. And um I would even
say this, Buudo itself, budo itself as

1388
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
say this, Buudo itself, budo itself as
 

1389
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,069
say this, Buudo itself, budo itself as
the Japanese developed it

1390
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079

 

1391
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,550

is part of this government

1392
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
is part of this government
 

1393
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,630
is part of this government
monopolization

1394
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
monopolization
 

1395
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,069
monopolization
of of uh the natural human tendency for

1396
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
of of uh the natural human tendency for
 

1397
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,990
of of uh the natural human tendency for
violence. And like we're trying to make

1398
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
violence. And like we're trying to make
 

1399
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,790
violence. And like we're trying to make
it unnatural. So for example, I

1400
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
it unnatural. So for example, I
 

1401
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,270
it unnatural. So for example, I
mentioned earlier I project and draw a

1402
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
mentioned earlier I project and draw a
 

1403
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,829
mentioned earlier I project and draw a
weapon. I draw my handgun. In the old

1404
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
weapon. I draw my handgun. In the old
 

1405
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,470
weapon. I draw my handgun. In the old
days, I would project and drew a sword.

1406
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
days, I would project and drew a sword.
 

1407
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,069
days, I would project and drew a sword.
You see that?

1408
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:48,079

 

1409
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,470

I don't think it's an accident that all

1410
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:50,480
I don't think it's an accident that all
 

1411
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,990
I don't think it's an accident that all
these Buddho traditions have stuck with

1412
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
these Buddho traditions have stuck with
 

1413
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,030
these Buddho traditions have stuck with
uh ancient impractical weapons

1414
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
uh ancient impractical weapons
 

1415
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,950
uh ancient impractical weapons
because they're not charged and they

1416
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960
because they're not charged and they
 

1417
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,910
because they're not charged and they
can't be used against the government.

1418
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
can't be used against the government.
 

1419
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,790
can't be used against the government.
You're you're going out in protest or

1420
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
You're you're going out in protest or
 

1421
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,710
You're you're going out in protest or
rebellion against the government with

1422
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
rebellion against the government with
 

1423
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:21,190
rebellion against the government with
swords would only be symbolic.

1424
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200

 

1425
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,270

you show up with AR-15s,

1426
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
you show up with AR-15s,
 

1427
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,030
you show up with AR-15s,
no one's going to think it's a simple,

1428
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
no one's going to think it's a simple,
 

1429
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,109
no one's going to think it's a simple,
you know.

1430
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:31,119

 

1431
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,750

So, yes, naturally, this is just in us.

1432
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
So, yes, naturally, this is just in us.
 

1433
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,390
So, yes, naturally, this is just in us.
There's no way around it.

1434
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,400
There's no way around it.
 

1435
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,750
There's no way around it.
Um,

1436
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760

 

1437
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,230

okay.

1438
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
okay.
 

1439
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,829
okay.
It's one of those things.

1440
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839

 

1441
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,589

I see this unself in me. I see a viable

1442
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
I see this unself in me. I see a viable
 

1443
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,069
I see this unself in me. I see a viable
practice that is complete.

1444
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
practice that is complete.
 

1445
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,309
practice that is complete.
But it goes through this

1446
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319

 

1447
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,630

charged repelling aspect of warriorhood.

1448
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640

 

1449
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,829

In other words, it's not a dead for me.

1450
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:11,839
In other words, it's not a dead for me.
 

1451
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,710
In other words, it's not a dead for me.
Modern Christianity is a dead is a dead

1452
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:14,720
Modern Christianity is a dead is a dead
 

1453

Okay, that's what viable means.

1472
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640
Okay, that's what viable means.
 

1473
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,069
Okay, that's what viable means.

the

1486
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920

 

1487
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,790

let's just call that the way.

1488
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800

 

1489
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,030

Here I am. I've been cultured

1490
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,040
Here I am. I've been cultured
 

1491
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,670
Here I am. I've been cultured
that I found the way, but my culture has

1492
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
that I found the way, but my culture has
 

1493
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,190
that I found the way, but my culture has
veered me away from it.

1494
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
veered me away from it.
 

1495
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,829
veered me away from it.
In my world,

1496
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
In my world,
 

1497
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,910
In my world,
my culture is a birth of the ego

1498
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
my culture is a birth of the ego
 

1499
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,670
my culture is a birth of the ego
tripartite mind.

1500
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:33,680

 

1501
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,950

So for me, this choice is not not

1502
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
So for me, this choice is not not
 

1503
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,990
So for me, this choice is not not
between my culture and the way. This

1504
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,000
between my culture and the way. This
 

1505
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,150
between my culture and the way. This
choice is between the light and the

1506
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
choice is between the light and the
 

1507
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,550
choice is between the light and the
darkness, between God and the devil.

1508
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:48,560

 

1509
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,870

So the choice is easy, but

1510
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
So the choice is easy, but
 

1511
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,550
So the choice is easy, but
there's still in each of you, you're

1512
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:54,560
there's still in each of you, you're
 

1513
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,750
there's still in each of you, you're
like, you have to get to that area where

1514
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
like, you have to get to that area where
 

1515
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,430
like, you have to get to that area where
you're like,

1516
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
you're like,
 

1517
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,750
you're like,
I don't like this violent part.

1518
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
I don't like this violent part.
 

1519
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,870
I don't like this violent part.
But I do like the part about I have to

1520
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
But I do like the part about I have to
 

1521
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,270
But I do like the part about I have to
find all the seeds of violence in me.

1522
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
find all the seeds of violence in me.
 

1523
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,750
find all the seeds of violence in me.
And to find those seeds, I have to pass

1524
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
And to find those seeds, I have to pass
 

1525
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,430
And to find those seeds, I have to pass
through this violence as my culture has

1526
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,440
through this violence as my culture has
 

1527
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,630
through this violence as my culture has
defined it. See,

1528
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640

 

1529
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,870

and I think that choice is as easy as it

1530
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
and I think that choice is as easy as it
 

1531
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,309
and I think that choice is as easy as it
is for as as I frame it for me.

1532
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:32,319

 

1533
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:38,309

And I think what you'll see as for me,

1534
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:38,319

 

1535
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,430

when I push you, do it. Do it to them.

1536
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
when I push you, do it. Do it to them.
 

1537
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,589
when I push you, do it. Do it to them.
Do it to them.

1538
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
Do it to them.
 

1539
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,829
Do it to them.
I'm not pushing you to vi to the

1540
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
I'm not pushing you to vi to the
 

1541
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,589
I'm not pushing you to vi to the
violence.

1542
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
violence.
 

1543
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,150
violence.
I'm pushing you into the violence

1544
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
I'm pushing you into the violence
 

1545
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,270
I'm pushing you into the violence
because you're not doing it from a

1546
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
because you're not doing it from a
 

1547
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,790
because you're not doing it from a
selfie

1548
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
selfie
 

1549
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:03,109
selfie
point of view. You see? So for example,

1550
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119

 

1551
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,589

you're early on contested or you're

1552
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
you're early on contested or you're
 

1553
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,990
you're early on contested or you're
early on uh

1554
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
early on uh
 

1555
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,190
early on uh
stop the energetic engine early on

1556
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200
stop the energetic engine early on
 

1557
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,950
stop the energetic engine early on
because you were already stuck in the

1558
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
because you were already stuck in the
 

1559
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,589
because you were already stuck in the
self. The technique is not going to work

1560
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
self. The technique is not going to work
 

1561
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,309
self. The technique is not going to work
and you already know it.

1562
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
and you already know it.
 

1563
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,309
and you already know it.
And so then you powder puff the ending

1564
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:24,319
And so then you powder puff the ending
 

1565
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,349
And so then you powder puff the ending
then but you think you were nice. You

1566
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
then but you think you were nice. You
 

1567
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,430
then but you think you were nice. You
see? So if my guess she can testify to

1568
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:31,440
see? So if my guess she can testify to
 

1569
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,910
see? So if my guess she can testify to
this

1570
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
this
 

1571
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,710
this
I'll say like do it and then you'll

1572
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
I'll say like do it and then you'll
 

1573
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,349
I'll say like do it and then you'll
realize you couldn't.

1574
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
realize you couldn't.
 

1575
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,030
realize you couldn't.
You see that is the only reason that I

1576
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
You see that is the only reason that I
 

1577
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,390
You see that is the only reason that I
will make you go past that other that

1578
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
will make you go past that other that
 

1579
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,990
will make you go past that other that
other stuff because you're hiding the

1580
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
other stuff because you're hiding the
 

1581
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,790
other stuff because you're hiding the
the moral. They're hiding the selfieing

1582
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
the moral. They're hiding the selfieing
 

1583
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,750
the moral. They're hiding the selfieing
with the moral cause. Okay?

1584
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
with the moral cause. Okay?
 

1585
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,870
with the moral cause. Okay?
If you're not selfing

1586
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
If you're not selfing
 

1587
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,670
If you're not selfing
and you're just killing people, then I

1588
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
and you're just killing people, then I
 

1589
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,910
and you're just killing people, then I
will tell you, hey, you don't need to do

1590
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
will tell you, hey, you don't need to do
 

1591
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,150
will tell you, hey, you don't need to do
it at that level. You do it at this

1592
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
it at that level. You do it at this
 

1593
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,630
it at that level. You do it at this
level.

1594
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,640
level.
 

1595
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,589
level.
Um,

1596
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
Um,
 

1597
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:22,230
Um,
like you saw me do it without there.

1598
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,240

 

1599
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,790

And in that sense then as you you you

1600
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
And in that sense then as you you you
 

1601
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,190
And in that sense then as you you you
made the you calculated what is the

1602
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
made the you calculated what is the
 

1603
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,349
made the you calculated what is the
equation in which I'm choosing A or B

1604
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
equation in which I'm choosing A or B
 

1605
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,589
equation in which I'm choosing A or B
from and then you go I'm going to go

1606
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
from and then you go I'm going to go
 

1607
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,910
from and then you go I'm going to go
ahead and choose it. You're going to see

1608
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
ahead and choose it. You're going to see
 

1609
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,630
ahead and choose it. You're going to see
that we're actually not doing what that

1610
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
that we're actually not doing what that
 

1611
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,349
that we're actually not doing what that
culture was telling us that we're doing.

1612
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359
culture was telling us that we're doing.
 

1613
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,069
culture was telling us that we're doing.
We're still doing the unselfing.

1614
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
We're still doing the unselfing.
 

1615
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,829
We're still doing the unselfing.
And when you don't sell

1616
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
And when you don't sell
 

1617
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,790
And when you don't sell
The expectation is that you're not ever

1618
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800
The expectation is that you're not ever
 

1619
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,150
The expectation is that you're not ever
hurting anyone. Okay? That you can do

1620
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
hurting anyone. Okay? That you can do
 

1621
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,109
hurting anyone. Okay? That you can do
the technique with the same level of

1622
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
the technique with the same level of
 

1623
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,349
the technique with the same level of
control from the same level above

1624
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:57,359
control from the same level above
 

1625
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:02,069
control from the same level above
selfie. Super slow and super gentle.

1626
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:02,079
selfie. Super slow and super gentle.
 

1627
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,270
selfie. Super slow and super gentle.
Even taking off the throat if need be,

1628
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
Even taking off the throat if need be,
 

1629
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,109
Even taking off the throat if need be,
right? And you don't feel like you're

1630
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:07,119
right? And you don't feel like you're
 

1631
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,910
right? And you don't feel like you're
not training enough.

1632
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:09,920
not training enough.
 

1633
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,109
not training enough.
But I can't get there if I don't ever go

1634
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:13,119
But I can't get there if I don't ever go
 

1635
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,270
But I can't get there if I don't ever go
there. That's that's the thing in modern

1636
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
there. That's that's the thing in modern
 

1637
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,549
there. That's that's the thing in modern
IPO never goes there. So what we do

1638
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:18,559
IPO never goes there. So what we do
 

1639
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,750
IPO never goes there. So what we do
instead in modern IPO is

1640
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:23,760
instead in modern IPO is
 

1641
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,309
instead in modern IPO is
I won't throw you I won't do that to you

1642
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:26,319
I won't throw you I won't do that to you
 

1643
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,430
I won't throw you I won't do that to you
because you're going to do it to

1644
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,440
because you're going to do it to
 

1645
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,670
because you're going to do it to
yourself. But then if you don't you see

1646
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680

everyone wants whoa, what the You

1868
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
everyone wants whoa, what the You
 

1869
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,950

happen. Uh it's just here. That's all
 

1875
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,230
happen. Uh it's just here. That's all
that happens, right? That's that's the

1876
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
that happens, right? That's that's the
 

1877
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,750
that happens, right? That's that's the
difference.

1878
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
difference.
 

1879
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,829
difference.
But even then, even then the quality of

1880
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:07,839
But even then, even then the quality of
 

1881
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,349
But even then, even then the quality of
the the throw is even different. Yes, I

1882
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
the the throw is even different. Yes, I
 

1883
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,630
the the throw is even different. Yes, I
would agree. I would agree. Yeah. Yeah.

1884
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
would agree. I would agree. Yeah. Yeah.
 

1885
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,109
would agree. I would agree. Yeah. Yeah.
All that kind of stuff. But that to me

1886
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:17,119
All that kind of stuff. But that to me
 

1887
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,190
All that kind of stuff. But that to me
that's what makes it potentially

1888
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
that's what makes it potentially
 

1889
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,349
that's what makes it potentially
spiritual because it triggers itself.

1890
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
spiritual because it triggers itself.
 

1891
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,230
spiritual because it triggers itself.
100% agree. Does everyone that's why you

1892
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
100% agree. Does everyone that's why you
 

1893
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,510
100% agree. Does everyone that's why you
can't you can't dial past that. You can

1894
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
can't you can't dial past that. You can
 

1895
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,829
can't you can't dial past that. You can
dial down but you can't dial around it.

1896
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
dial down but you can't dial around it.
 

1897
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,549
dial down but you can't dial around it.
So I I when when I did that case on

1898
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:32,559
So I I when when I did that case on
 

1899
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,309
So I I when when I did that case on
Fouching, believe me, she's struggling

00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
Fouching, believe me, she's struggling
 

1901
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,630
Fouching, believe me, she's struggling
with selfie even at that pace. Okay,

1904
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:44,400

 

1905
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,069

e even as uh

e even as uh
 

1907
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,750
e even as uh
I didn't throw that knee because that

1908
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
I didn't throw that knee because that
 

1909
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,910

was going to shut Chris down right away.

1910
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
was going to shut Chris down right away.
 

1911
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,430
was going to shut Chris down right away.
Okay, that was going to hit him on the

1912
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:53,440
Okay, that was going to hit him on the
 

1913
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,309
Okay, that was going to hit him on the
hit him in the in the solar plexus and

1914
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:56,319
hit him in the in the solar plexus and
 

1915
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,789
hit him in the in the solar plexus and
then he would have just collapsed right

1916
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
then he would have just collapsed right
 

1917
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,710
then he would have just collapsed right
there. It would look something like

1918
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
there. It would look something like
 

1919
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:14,870
there. It would look something like
this.

1920
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880

 

1921
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,190

Right. They're laughing because that's

1922
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
Right. They're laughing because that's
 

1923
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,390
Right. They're laughing because that's
exactly right.

1924
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
exactly right.
 

1925
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,630
exactly right.
It would we would not be training them.

1926
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:22,640
It would we would not be training them.
 

1927
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,990
It would we would not be training them.
You see some someone on on on Ronin,

1931
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,990
right? He'd see that knee. He He knew he
 up. He'd see the knee push the

1932
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,000
up. He'd see the knee push the
 

1933
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,190
up. He'd see the knee push the
knee down. He'd get the hell out of

1934
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
knee down. He'd get the hell out of
 

1935

cuz he blocked it, he woke up. Okay? And
then he would come back in

1942
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:45,599
then he would come back in
 

1943
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,030
then he would come back in
and everyone's different because

the fear and the selfie and the need for

1958
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
the fear and the selfie and the need for
 

1959
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,670
the fear and the selfie and the need for
control that you're not helping them

1960
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
control that you're not helping them
 

1961
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,630
control that you're not helping them
that way. And yes, that you know, to be

1962
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:14,640
that way. And yes, that you know, to be
 

1963
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,789
that way. And yes, that you know, to be
honest, that just does not feel good.

1964
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:16,799
honest, that just does not feel good.
 

1965
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:21,030
honest, that just does not feel good.
That's a big part why um

1966
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
That's a big part why um
 

1967
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,150
That's a big part why um
I'm just not interested in

1968
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
I'm just not interested in
 

1969
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,789
I'm just not interested in
trying to get as many people because the

1970
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:26,799
trying to get as many people because the
 

1971
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,549
trying to get as many people because the
there's a lot of people that like the

1972
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
there's a lot of people that like the
 

1973
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,309
there's a lot of people that like the
idea but can't do the idea. Do do you

1974
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
idea but can't do the idea. Do do you
 

1975
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,190
idea but can't do the idea. Do do you
know what I mean? And so you're just

1976
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200
know what I mean? And so you're just
 

1977
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,349
know what I mean? And so you're just
you're going to have to always pull back

1978
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
you're going to have to always pull back
 

1979
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,870
you're going to have to always pull back
and then they get to just self.

1980
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
and then they get to just self.
 

1981
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,670
and then they get to just self.
And now you're actually hurting them

1982
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
And now you're actually hurting them
 

1983
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,910
And now you're actually hurting them
because from your perspective that's the

1984
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
because from your perspective that's the
 

1985
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,150
because from your perspective that's the
seed of all suffering

1986
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
seed of all suffering
 

1987
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,030
seed of all suffering
and you're just reifying yourself. But

1988
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,040
and you're just reifying yourself. But
 

1989
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,870
and you're just reifying yourself. But
now

1990
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:56,880
now
 

1991
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,069
now
it never feels good.

1992
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
it never feels good.
 

1993
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,829
it never feels good.
It's not there's no pleasure in it for

1994
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:01,839
It's not there's no pleasure in it for
 

1995
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,109
It's not there's no pleasure in it for
me.

1996
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
me.
 

1997
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,270
me.
They had that I go through cycles. If

1998
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,280
They had that I go through cycles. If
 

1999
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,390
They had that I go through cycles. If
they know, you got to remember I'm done.

2000
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
they know, you got to remember I'm done.
 

2001
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,270
they know, you got to remember I'm done.
I'm not hitting you guys anymore because

2002
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:11,280
I'm not hitting you guys anymore because
 

2003
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,430
I'm not hitting you guys anymore because
I I go through these cycles.

2004
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440

 

2005
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,710

We had one guy,

2006
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
We had one guy,
 

2007
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:25,270
We had one guy,
Julian was the last one.

2008
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280

 

2009
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,430

Julian decided that he didn't know if it

2010
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,440
Julian decided that he didn't know if it
 

2011
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,589
Julian decided that he didn't know if it
was real or not. So decides to test it

2012
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:33,599
was real or not. So decides to test it
 

2013
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,750
was real or not. So decides to test it
and um

2014
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
and um
 

2015
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,069
and um
I can feel all that. You can feel it.

2016
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079

 

2017
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,230

And I think it was a similar technique.

2018
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:44,240
And I think it was a similar technique.
 

2019
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,789
And I think it was a similar technique.
I know it was a hammer fist in the face.

2020
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
I know it was a hammer fist in the face.
 

2021
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,510
I know it was a hammer fist in the face.
So he decided he was going to turn in

2022
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
So he decided he was going to turn in
 

2023
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,190
So he decided he was going to turn in
the technique. Um but instead of turning

2024
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:53,200
the technique. Um but instead of turning
 

2025
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,829
the technique. Um but instead of turning
out of this hesitation, just turning out

2026
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:55,839
out of this hesitation, just turning out
 

2027
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,789
out of this hesitation, just turning out
of the the intention

2028
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
of the the intention
 

2029
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:04,150
of the the intention
uh and with an assault. So

2030
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
uh and with an assault. So
 

2031
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,109
uh and with an assault. So
I ended up hammerfisting him and it

2032
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:07,119
I ended up hammerfisting him and it
 

2033
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,430
I ended up hammerfisting him and it
broke his nose and his blood went all

2034
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,440
broke his nose and his blood went all
 

2035
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,150
broke his nose and his blood went all
over the place. And then he w he like

2036
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
over the place. And then he w he like
 

2037
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,910
over the place. And then he w he like
woke up. He felt guilty as hell. He's

2038
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:13,920
woke up. He felt guilty as hell. He's
 

2039
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,829
woke up. He felt guilty as hell. He's
like, "I shouldn't have doubted you."

2040
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:15,839
like, "I shouldn't have doubted you."
 

2041
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,950
like, "I shouldn't have doubted you."
And uh but why did the doubt come?

2042
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
And uh but why did the doubt come?
 

2043
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,589
And uh but why did the doubt come?
Because the training

2044
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
Because the training
 

2045
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,349
Because the training
was had to be soft enough for him. You

2046
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
was had to be soft enough for him. You
 

2047
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,630
was had to be soft enough for him. You
see the the doubt is coming from the

2048
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,640
see the the doubt is coming from the
 

2049
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,990
see the the doubt is coming from the
self. The self can't do this level of

2050
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
self. The self can't do this level of
 

2051
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,710
self. The self can't do this level of
training. So the training had to be

2052
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
training. So the training had to be
 

2053
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,430
training. So the training had to be
softened for him and it's just feeding

2054
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:37,440
softened for him and it's just feeding
 

2055
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,789
softened for him and it's just feeding
him. And so he had to go to this level

2056
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:40,799
him. And so he had to go to this level
 

2057
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,030
him. And so he had to go to this level
and now it broke him and required me to

2058
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,040
and now it broke him and required me to
 

2059
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,710
and now it broke him and required me to
go to that. And I was like, I'm not

2060
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720
go to that. And I was like, I'm not
 

2061
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,630
go to that. And I was like, I'm not
doing this for no one else. This is for

2062
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
doing this for no one else. This is for
 

2063
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,990
doing this for no one else. This is for
my sons only. My sons are those who will

2064
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
my sons only. My sons are those who will
 

2065
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,030
my sons only. My sons are those who will
align with me, male or female.

2066
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,040

 

2067
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:02,950

Just like the sons of God.

2068
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:02,960

 

2069
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,589

So that's why I don't I don't I'm not

2070
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
So that's why I don't I don't I'm not
 

2071
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,109
So that's why I don't I don't I'm not
going to let you in because I'm not

2072
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
going to let you in because I'm not
 

2073
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,309
going to let you in because I'm not
going to reify yourself and if it's

2074
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
going to reify yourself and if it's
 

2075
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,150
going to reify yourself and if it's
going to take this extra level of

2076
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
going to take this extra level of
 

2077
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:17,589
going to take this extra level of
violence. No, we're not doing that.

2078
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599

 

2079
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,030

Again, my try to motivate you. You do

2080
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:21,040
Again, my try to motivate you. You do
 

2081
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,670
Again, my try to motivate you. You do
it. You do the alignment. You don't need

2082
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
it. You do the alignment. You don't need
 

2083
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,270
it. You do the alignment. You don't need
the whacking stick. Don't need it.

2084
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
the whacking stick. Don't need it.
 

2085
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,190
the whacking stick. Don't need it.
Here's the self. Here's what it does.

Here's the self. Here's what it does.
 

2087
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,630
Here's the self. Here's what it does.
Here's what it feels like. Here's what

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,069
Here's what it feels like. Here's what
it looks like. Let go.

2090
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079

 

2091
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,190

So, very similarly, we we make these

2092
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
So, very similarly, we we make these
 

2093
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,190
So, very similarly, we we make these
jokes. You've heard me make these jokes.

2094
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
jokes. You've heard me make these jokes.
 

2095
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,069
jokes. You've heard me make these jokes.

2100
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
and you're not going to do it. And then
 

2101
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,270
and you're not going to do it. And then

I always go or not.
 

2103
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,030
I always go or not.
I think a couple of those came out this

2104
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,040
I think a couple of those came out this
 

2105
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,309
I think a couple of those came out this
week.

2106
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319

 

2107
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,589

Or how about you try our technique? You

2108
01:03:01,589 --> 01:03:01,599
Or how about you try our technique? You
 

2109
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,510
Or how about you try our technique? You
heard that one,

2110
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,520
heard that one,
 

2111
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:09,030
heard that one,
right?

2112
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,040

 

2113
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,069

Early on. We had our own little

01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
Early on. We had our own little
 

2115
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,990
Early on. We had our own little
preface into this camp. And one of the

2116
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
preface into this camp. And one of the
 

2117
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,309
preface into this camp. And one of the
things I said

2118
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
things I said
 

2119
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,029
things I said
to this group cuz he already knows how

2120
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
to this group cuz he already knows how
 

2121
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,349
to this group cuz he already knows how
to do this. You felt that firsthand.

2122
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
to do this. You felt that firsthand.
 

2123
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,270
to do this. You felt that firsthand.
He's going to whatever you do, he's

2124
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,280
He's going to whatever you do, he's
 

2125
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,750
He's going to whatever you do, he's
going to throw you

2126
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:25,760
going to throw you
 

2127
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,829
going to throw you
whatever thing. But I had to tell this

2128
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
whatever thing. But I had to tell this
 

2129
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,069
whatever thing. But I had to tell this
group

2130
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
group
 

2131
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,069
group
whatever you need to do, you make the

2132
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:32,079
whatever you need to do, you make the
 

2133
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,710
whatever you need to do, you make the
throw work.

2134
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
throw work.
 

2135
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,349
throw work.
But why?

2136
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:37,359
But why?
 

2137
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,829
But why?
Because they're selfieing and getting

2138
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
Because they're selfieing and getting
 

2139
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,069
Because they're selfieing and getting
themselves in situations where the throw

2140
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
themselves in situations where the throw
 

2141
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,630
themselves in situations where the throw
cannot work.

2142
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640

 

2143
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,390

So even just recently, just right here,

2144
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
So even just recently, just right here,
 

2145
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,150
So even just recently, just right here,
you're

2146
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
you're
 

2147
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,309
you're
 footing around the throat and I

2148
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
footing around the throat and I
 

2149
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,390
footing around the throat and I
go, "Do it." And then you bounced off of

2150
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
go, "Do it." And then you bounced off of
 

2151
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,190
go, "Do it." And then you bounced off of
him

2152
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
him
 

2153
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:15,670
him
cuz you have that tension in your body.

2154
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:15,680

 

2155
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,069

I think any actual spiritual mentor

2156
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,079
I think any actual spiritual mentor
 

2157
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,109
I think any actual spiritual mentor
has to struggle with that. I mean it

2158
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
has to struggle with that. I mean it
 

2159
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:32,870
has to struggle with that. I mean it
does take like is sense.

2160
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:32,880

 

2161
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,109

I learned a lot from him. Nowhere near

2162
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
I learned a lot from him. Nowhere near
 

2163
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,789
I learned a lot from him. Nowhere near
what you're seeing here because he had a

2164
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
what you're seeing here because he had a
 

2165
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,309
what you're seeing here because he had a
lot of students. They can't do what I

2166
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
lot of students. They can't do what I
 

2167
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:45,190
lot of students. They can't do what I
do. But he was influential in my life.

2168
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:45,200

 

2169
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,029

But he didn't give a about no one

2170
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:47,039
But he didn't give a about no one
 

2171
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,190
But he didn't give a about no one
else.

2172
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
else.
 

2173
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,430
else.
The second you

2174
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
The second you
 

2175
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,829
The second you
did your own thing, he would let you do

2176
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
did your own thing, he would let you do
 

2177
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,230
did your own thing, he would let you do
your own thing. He would not take the

2178
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:58,240
your own thing. He would not take the
 

2179
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,549
your own thing. He would not take the
time or the energy nor experience

2180
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
time or the energy nor experience
 

2181
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,150
time or the energy nor experience
the repercussions of reeling you back

2182
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
the repercussions of reeling you back
 

2183
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,390
the repercussions of reeling you back
into alignment.

2184
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
into alignment.
 

2185
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,150
into alignment.
And I think that this is related, right?

2186
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
And I think that this is related, right?
 

2187
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,309
And I think that this is related, right?
Like I'm not going to do it to you. And

2188
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
Like I'm not going to do it to you. And
 

2189
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,950
Like I'm not going to do it to you. And
I that's how a lot of teachers are.

2190
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
I that's how a lot of teachers are.
 

2191
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,589
I that's how a lot of teachers are.
They're not going to hold you

2192
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:19,599
They're not going to hold you
 

2193
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,950
They're not going to hold you
They're going to let you do your own

2194
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
They're going to let you do your own
 

2195
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,589
They're going to let you do your own
thing. That's why the mat looks

2196
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:23,599
thing. That's why the mat looks
 

2197
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,589
thing. That's why the mat looks
everyone's doing their own thing. That's

2198
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:25,599
everyone's doing their own thing. That's
 

2199
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,670
everyone's doing their own thing. That's
why when I stop you, it feels so weird

2200
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
why when I stop you, it feels so weird
 

2201
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,109
why when I stop you, it feels so weird
to what maybe you're used to or why we

2202
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
to what maybe you're used to or why we
 

2203
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,390
to what maybe you're used to or why we
go back to a progression to give you the

2204
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
go back to a progression to give you the
 

2205
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,870
go back to a progression to give you the
chance to get it to get it before we go

2206
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
chance to get it to get it before we go
 

2207
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,870
chance to get it to get it before we go
on. Do you see why the lessons feed off

2208
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
on. Do you see why the lessons feed off
 

2209
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,950
on. Do you see why the lessons feed off
of the other lessons and we don't jump

2210
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
of the other lessons and we don't jump
 

2211
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,870
of the other lessons and we don't jump
all over the place? You could jump all

2212
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
all over the place? You could jump all
 

2213
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,549
all over the place? You could jump all
over the place when you don't give a

2214
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
over the place when you don't give a
 

2215
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,630
over the place when you don't give a
 what everyone's doing. You see, who

2216
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
what everyone's doing. You see, who
 

2217
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,470
what everyone's doing. You see, who
cares?

2218
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480

 

2219
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,390

So even from the teacher's point of

2220
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
So even from the teacher's point of
 

2221
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,630
So even from the teacher's point of
view, there's, you know, we understand

2222
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
view, there's, you know, we understand
 

2223
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,349
view, there's, you know, we understand
violence and this grander thing, it's

2224
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:01,359
violence and this grander thing, it's
 

2225
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,390
violence and this grander thing, it's
like they don't want to do this, but I

2226
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
like they don't want to do this, but I
 

2227
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,430
like they don't want to do this, but I
am going to make them do it by making it

2228
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
am going to make them do it by making it
 

2229
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,670
am going to make them do it by making it
impossible for them to not do it.

2230
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
impossible for them to not do it.
 

2231
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,230
impossible for them to not do it.
So,

2232
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
So,
 

2233
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,910
So,
just like I told you, the way you were

2234
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
just like I told you, the way you were
 

2235
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,510
just like I told you, the way you were
moving your feet that time, I'm going to

2236
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:17,520
moving your feet that time, I'm going to
 

2237
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,109
moving your feet that time, I'm going to
come up with a version where you can't

2238
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
come up with a version where you can't
 

2239
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,190
come up with a version where you can't
move your feet like that. That's the

2240
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,200
move your feet like that. That's the
 

2241
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,029
move your feet like that. That's the
kind of violence he wanted to do it one

2242
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:25,039
kind of violence he wanted to do it one
 

2243
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,950
kind of violence he wanted to do it one
way, he wanted to do it another way, but

2244
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:26,960
way, he wanted to do it another way, but
 

2245
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,470
way, he wanted to do it another way, but
I wanted him to do it this way

2246
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
I wanted him to do it this way
 

2247
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,309
I wanted him to do it this way
because I wanted him to use the force

2248
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
because I wanted him to use the force
 

2249
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,750
because I wanted him to use the force
engine, which requires the unself.

2250
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
engine, which requires the unself.
 

2251
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,589
engine, which requires the unself.
All right? And then I combined that with

2252
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
All right? And then I combined that with
 

2253
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,430
All right? And then I combined that with
everyone that wanted to find their

2254
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,440
everyone that wanted to find their
 

2255
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,990
everyone that wanted to find their
inside foot. I'm going to take away your

2256
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
inside foot. I'm going to take away your
 

2257
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,510
inside foot. I'm going to take away your
inside foot. We're going to sweep the

2258
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
inside foot. We're going to sweep the
 

2259
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,910
inside foot. We're going to sweep the
leg. You see, that's the kind of

2260
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:45,920
leg. You see, that's the kind of
 

2261
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,670
leg. You see, that's the kind of
violence.

2262
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
violence.
 

2263
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,670
violence.
Everyone wanted to be able to find that

2264
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
Everyone wanted to be able to find that
 

2265
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,029
Everyone wanted to be able to find that
inside foot and just calmly lay down.

2266
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
inside foot and just calmly lay down.
 

2267
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,150
inside foot and just calmly lay down.
But there's no training in that.

2268
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
But there's no training in that.
 

2269
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,230
But there's no training in that.
And there has to be something in you as

2270
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:58,240
And there has to be something in you as
 

2271
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,589
And there has to be something in you as
the teacher who's like going and saying

2272
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:03,599
the teacher who's like going and saying
 

2273
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,670
the teacher who's like going and saying
it's going to be uncomfortable. It

2274
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:05,680
it's going to be uncomfortable. It
 

2275
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,309
it's going to be uncomfortable. It
really is uncomfortable.

2276
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
really is uncomfortable.
 

2277
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,789
really is uncomfortable.
We're not honest, but you have to be

2278
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
We're not honest, but you have to be
 

2279
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,950
We're not honest, but you have to be
able to go, "No,

2280
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
able to go, "No,
 

2281
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,750
able to go, "No,
we have to go there." And so, we go

2282
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:15,760
we have to go there." And so, we go
 

2283
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,069
we have to go there." And so, we go
there. And then you balance out for risk

2284
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:18,079
there. And then you balance out for risk
 

2285
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,950
there. And then you balance out for risk
and safety and all that kind of stuff,

2286
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:20,960
and safety and all that kind of stuff,
 

2287
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,990
and safety and all that kind of stuff,
but you can't cave into the initial

2288
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
but you can't cave into the initial
 

2289
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,430
but you can't cave into the initial
impulses. This is going to be

2290
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
impulses. This is going to be
 

2291
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,309
impulses. This is going to be
uncomfortable. So, let's not go there.

2292
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
uncomfortable. So, let's not go there.
 

2293
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,109
uncomfortable. So, let's not go there.
Okay? So, likewise, you and yourself,

2294
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
Okay? So, likewise, you and yourself,
 

2295
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,029
Okay? So, likewise, you and yourself,
you have to do that. And if you do that,

2296
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
you have to do that. And if you do that,
 

2297
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,230
you have to do that. And if you do that,
your teacher can do it more while having

2298
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
your teacher can do it more while having
 

2299
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,549
your teacher can do it more while having
to do it less.

2300
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
to do it less.
 

2301
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,990
to do it less.
Okay? If you're ready to be

2302
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,000
Okay? If you're ready to be
 

2303
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,710
Okay? If you're ready to be
uncomfortable, then we you're working on

2304
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
uncomfortable, then we you're working on
 

2305
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,029
uncomfortable, then we you're working on
it. We're doing it. Okay? If the

2306
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
it. We're doing it. Okay? If the
 

2307
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,109
it. We're doing it. Okay? If the
uncomfortability immediately makes you

2308
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
uncomfortability immediately makes you
 

2309
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,430
uncomfortability immediately makes you
want to stop

2310
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
want to stop
 

2311
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,549
want to stop
have any but but stopping broader any

2312
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:52,559
have any but but stopping broader any
 

2313
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,430
have any but but stopping broader any
frustration, any depression, any guilt,

2314
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
frustration, any depression, any guilt,
 

2315
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,230
frustration, any depression, any guilt,
any shame, anything like that is all

2316
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
any shame, anything like that is all
 

2317
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:07,990
any shame, anything like that is all
resistance towards we're going there.

2318
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000

 

2319
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,910

You're already dead. Go. What do you

2320
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
You're already dead. Go. What do you
 

2321
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,349
You're already dead. Go. What do you
What's there to be ashamed of? What's

2322
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
What's there to be ashamed of? What's
 

2323
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,150
What's there to be ashamed of? What's
there to be guilty of? What's there to

2324
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
there to be guilty of? What's there to
 

2325
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:20,470
there to be guilty of? What's there to
regret? What's there to dread?

2326
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:20,480

 

2327
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,829

I'll close with this.

2328
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839

 

2329
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:31,990

This is why traditionally

2330
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,000

 

2331
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,110

The way

2332
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
The way
 

2333
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:41,030
The way
of the sons of God is in this alignment.

2334
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040

 

2335
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,189

It goes down. It goes down too. So your

2336
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
It goes down. It goes down too. So your
 

2337
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:51,030
It goes down. It goes down too. So your
first alignment is with the teacher.

2338
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040

 

2339
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,749

This is a micro version of this other

2340
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
This is a micro version of this other
 

2341
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,870
This is a micro version of this other
alignment.

2342
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880

 

2343
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,749

You can't. This voice is going to talk

2344
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
You can't. This voice is going to talk
 

2345
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,229
You can't. This voice is going to talk
to you sooner or later and you can't go

2346
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
to you sooner or later and you can't go
 

2347
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,030
to you sooner or later and you can't go
hold on. Wait.

2348
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:07,040
hold on. Wait.
 

2349
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,749
hold on. Wait.
How about if you can't negotiate?

2350
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:11,759

 

2351
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,430

Well, the same thing. That's that's what

2352
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
Well, the same thing. That's that's what
 

2353
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,070
Well, the same thing. That's that's what
you practice with your teacher first.

2354
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,080

 

2355
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,630

That's terrifying.

2356
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
That's terrifying.
 

2357
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,349
That's terrifying.
But the other one you don't have a shot

2358
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
But the other one you don't have a shot
 

2359
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,590
But the other one you don't have a shot
if this is terrifying.

2360
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600

 

2361
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,269

Hey, don't move your foot there. Move

2362
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
Hey, don't move your foot there. Move
 

2363
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,390
Hey, don't move your foot there. Move
your foot here. If I can't do that

2364
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
your foot here. If I can't do that
 

2365
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,470
your foot here. If I can't do that
because it's too terrifying or because

2366
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
because it's too terrifying or because
 

2367
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,229
because it's too terrifying or because
there's too much self that I have to let

2368
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
there's too much self that I have to let
 

2369
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,910
there's too much self that I have to let
go of. If I can't do it just because

2370
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:39,920
go of. If I can't do it just because
 

2371
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,910
go of. If I can't do it just because
that person told me to do it. If that's

2372
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
that person told me to do it. If that's
 

2373
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,990
that person told me to do it. If that's
not enough to get me to do it, there's

2374
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
not enough to get me to do it, there's
 

2375
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,630
not enough to get me to do it, there's
no way

2376
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:46,640
no way
 

2377
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,749
no way
I'm going to align with the divine.

2378
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:49,759
I'm going to align with the divine.
 

2379
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,910
I'm going to align with the divine.
There's no way.

2380
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:53,920

 

2381
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,950

It's like if I can't do

2382
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
It's like if I can't do
 

2383
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,590
It's like if I can't do
drill one, there's no way I can do drill

2384
01:09:59,590 --> 01:09:59,600
drill one, there's no way I can do drill
 

2385
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,510
drill one, there's no way I can do drill
two. There's no way I can do drill

2386
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
two. There's no way I can do drill
 

2387
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,470
two. There's no way I can do drill
three. There's no way I can do tima.

2388
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,480
three. There's no way I can do tima.
 

2389
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,830
three. There's no way I can do tima.
You see, it goes on like that. This

2390
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840
You see, it goes on like that. This
 

2391
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,830
You see, it goes on like that. This
cultivation field between the teacher

2392
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
cultivation field between the teacher
 

2393
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,310
cultivation field between the teacher
and the guest

2394
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
and the guest
 

2395
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,270
and the guest
is it's way easier.

2396
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
is it's way easier.
 

2397
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,750
is it's way easier.
If I can't do it here, I can't do it

2398
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:17,760
If I can't do it here, I can't do it
 

2399
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,950
If I can't do it here, I can't do it
there. So,

2400
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:20,960
there. So,
 

2401
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,430
there. So,
it should be a big deal. The teacher not

2402
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,440
it should be a big deal. The teacher not
 

2403
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,550
it should be a big deal. The teacher not
have to say or not or how about try

2404
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
have to say or not or how about try
 

2405
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,190
have to say or not or how about try
ours. It shouldn't have to be.

2406
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:30,200
ours. It shouldn't have to be.
 

2407
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,990
ours. It shouldn't have to be.
[Music]

2408
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000

 

2409
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,149

And I think if we do all that, we won't

2410
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:36,159
And I think if we do all that, we won't
 

2411
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,430
And I think if we do all that, we won't
even get we can circumvent this. I'm

2412
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
even get we can circumvent this. I'm
 

2413
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,110
even get we can circumvent this. I'm
doing something to someone else. Do you

2414
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
doing something to someone else. Do you
 

2415
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,510
doing something to someone else. Do you
know what I mean? It gets filtered

2416
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:43,520
know what I mean? It gets filtered
 

2417
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,990
know what I mean? It gets filtered
through the teacher

2418
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
through the teacher
 

2419
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,350
through the teacher
and it gets filtered through the

2420
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,360
and it gets filtered through the
 

2421
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,149
and it gets filtered through the
teaching. I'm not doing violence.

2422
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:50,159
teaching. I'm not doing violence.
 

2423
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,199
teaching. I'm not doing violence.
I'm creating an unselfy
