it could be used as a takedown like a
lot of techniques can be used to take

110
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
lot of techniques can be used to take
 

111
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,630

123
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,190
right he can't do anything to me and
from a good control point right now

124
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
from a good control point right now
 

125
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,630
from a good control point right now
understand that that also is true here

126
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
understand that that also is true here
 

127
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,110

right so in all those positions by

132
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
right so in all those positions by
 

133
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,390
right so in all those positions by
controlling his elbow he can't use a

134
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
controlling his elbow he can't use a
 

135
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,869
controlling his elbow he can't use a
weapon on me and i think that is

136
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
weapon on me and i think that is
 

137
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,229
weapon on me and i think that is

number one most important part okay now
 

171
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,990
number one most important part okay now
understand that it's gonna come up all

172
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
understand that it's gonna come up all
 

173
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,470
understand that it's gonna come up all
the time so that elbow control is gonna

174
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
the time so that elbow control is gonna
 

175
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,790
the time so that elbow control is gonna
come up all the time so let's say josh

176
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
come up all the time so let's say josh
 

177

you're constantly getting eco now it's
 

193
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,030
you're constantly getting eco now it's
not the most dominant form of ikyo and

not the most dominant form of ikyo and
 

195
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,789
not the most dominant form of ikyo and
it's not an eco that takes someone down

it's not an eco that takes someone down
 

197
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,710
it's not an eco that takes someone down
it's not eco that hurts him or anything

it's not eco that hurts him or anything
 

199
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,630
it's not eco that hurts him or anything
but it does a really functional job for

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,550
when i cut and run his natural defense
is going to be this which is our

228
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
is going to be this which is our
 

229
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,470
is going to be this which is our
shomonucci position now what i would

230
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
shomonucci position now what i would
 

231
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,789
shomonucci position now what i would
like to do is go into something here

232
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
like to do is go into something here
 

233
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,550
like to do is go into something here
right to keep him from grabbing me so i

234
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
right to keep him from grabbing me so i
 

235
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,990
right to keep him from grabbing me so i
could control him right and i could

236
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
could control him right and i could
 

237
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,429
could control him right and i could
definitely use the weapon in lots of

238
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
definitely use the weapon in lots of
 

239
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,990
definitely use the weapon in lots of
ways here also if he were to get a hold

240
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
ways here also if he were to get a hold
 

241
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,429
ways here also if he were to get a hold
of my hand

242
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
of my hand
 

243
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,310
of my hand
hitting at that elbow in any kind of

244
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
hitting at that elbow in any kind of
 

245
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,030
hitting at that elbow in any kind of
fashion is likely to get his hand off of

246
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
fashion is likely to get his hand off of
 

247
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,030
fashion is likely to get his hand off of
me right so that's going to be another

248
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
me right so that's going to be another
 

249
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,670
me right so that's going to be another
great function of eq and why eq is so

250
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
great function of eq and why eq is so
 

251
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,110
great function of eq and why eq is so
important all right now if this guy has

252
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
important all right now if this guy has
 

253
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,110
important all right now if this guy has
a knife i also might need to use that as

254
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
a knife i also might need to use that as
 

255
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,670
a knife i also might need to use that as
a control but in truth really rokio is

256
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
a control but in truth really rokio is
 

257
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,430
a control but in truth really rokio is
going to work out better for me or nico

258
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
going to work out better for me or nico
 

259
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,710
going to work out better for me or nico
or coatigatch all kinds of other stuff

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
or coatigatch all kinds of other stuff
 

261
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,390
or coatigatch all kinds of other stuff
is going to work out better than this

262
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
is going to work out better than this
 

263
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,390
is going to work out better than this
eco so it's functional we could use it

264
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
eco so it's functional we could use it
 

265
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,990
eco so it's functional we could use it
that way but that's not going to be its

266
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
that way but that's not going to be its
 

267
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,670
that way but that's not going to be its
primary objective our primary objective

268
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
primary objective our primary objective
 

269
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,390
primary objective our primary objective
is just to hold the elbow now it does

270
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
is just to hold the elbow now it does
 

271
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,629
is just to hold the elbow now it does
come in great hand when i need to get

272
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
come in great hand when i need to get
 

273
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,550
come in great hand when i need to get
here and make my escape and you can see

274
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
here and make my escape and you can see
 

275
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,070
here and make my escape and you can see
i'm holding the eco and if josh will

276
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
i'm holding the eco and if josh will
 

277
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,830
i'm holding the eco and if josh will
stop for a second i can make my escape

278
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
stop for a second i can make my escape
 

279
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,150
stop for a second i can make my escape
so i i can get out of there by

280
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
so i i can get out of there by
 

281
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,070
so i i can get out of there by
controlling that elbow right and of

282
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
controlling that elbow right and of
 

283
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,590
controlling that elbow right and of
course if we did chase each other around

284
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
course if we did chase each other around
 

285
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,950
course if we did chase each other around
like that i could use it as a takedown

286
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
like that i could use it as a takedown
 

287
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,390
like that i could use it as a takedown
or i could transition into sanctuary i

288
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
or i could transition into sanctuary i
 

289
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,150
or i could transition into sanctuary i
could do something else now that's

290
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
could do something else now that's
 

291
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,749
could do something else now that's
another good point of why eco is so

292
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
another good point of why eco is so
 

293
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,790
another good point of why eco is so
important is it readily transitions into

294
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
important is it readily transitions into
 

295
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,950
important is it readily transitions into
all our other techniques right so let's

296
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
all our other techniques right so let's
 

297
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,550
all our other techniques right so let's
mock up go to this side for me let's

298
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
mock up go to this side for me let's
 

299
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,390
mock up go to this side for me let's
mock up that situation we just had okay

300
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
mock up that situation we just had okay
 

301
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,909
mock up that situation we just had okay
so i'm here and i'm trying to make my

302
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
so i'm here and i'm trying to make my
 

303
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,590
so i'm here and i'm trying to make my
escape this guy's sticking with me right

304
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
escape this guy's sticking with me right
 

305

right this
 

309
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,510
right this
