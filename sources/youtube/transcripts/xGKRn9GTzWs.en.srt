son so you want to have drills to

286
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
son so you want to have drills to
 

287
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,110

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
give micro drills to help them get there
 

295
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,750
give micro drills to help them get there
so here is a micro drill to help Not

296
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
so here is a micro drill to help Not
 

297
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,670

freak out so what is happening is it
looks like it's nothing when I'm hitting

300
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:08,760
looks like it's nothing when I'm hitting
 

301
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,870
looks like it's nothing when I'm hitting
him but he has my energy and my presence

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
in that tip and it starts to generate
 

305
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,110
in that tip and it starts to generate
fear and fear makes the ike go away okay

and then he can't feel the adhesion he

308
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
and then he can't feel the adhesion he
 

309
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,470
and then he can't feel the adhesion he
won't feel it he he won't let that

310

327
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,710
position I'm just standing here and I'll
do the adhesion and the swipe back and

328
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
do the adhesion and the swipe back and
 

329
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,200
do the adhesion and the swipe back and
he's just going to get used to

330
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,210

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,829
energy his weapon going to be here
upward

526
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
upward
 

527
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,230
upward
energy how come you

528
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
energy how come you
 

529
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,069
energy how come you
move think about it you you did move do

530
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
move think about it you you did move do
 

531
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,749
move think about it you you did move do
you feel that you have upward energy

532
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:11,759
you feel that you have upward energy
 

533
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,269
you feel that you have upward energy
here I am Bo it moved you forward how

534
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
here I am Bo it moved you forward how
 

535
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,269
here I am Bo it moved you forward how
can you

536
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
can you
 

537
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,990
can you
move think about it why I okay so I had

538
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
move think about it why I okay so I had
 

539
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,949
move think about it why I okay so I had
the iion right so I have to match Yang

540
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:25,959
the iion right so I have to match Yang
 

541
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,189
the iion right so I have to match Yang
energy got that okay

542
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
energy got that okay
 

543
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,670
energy got that okay
so now do the math where's the Y energy

544
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:32,680
so now do the math where's the Y energy
 

545
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,110
so now do the math where's the Y energy
in the upward energy do you get that and

546
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
in the upward energy do you get that and
 

547
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,629
in the upward energy do you get that and
when you have the upward energy then

548
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:37,639
when you have the upward energy then
 

549
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,629
when you have the upward energy then
right here got that so what you're doing

550
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
right here got that so what you're doing
 

551
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,829
right here got that so what you're doing
here is no

552
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:42,839
here is no
 

553
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,629
here is no
energy you got that and so when he goes

554
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:45,639
energy you got that and so when he goes

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
can allow the adhesion to happen here
 

579
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,749
can allow the adhesion to happen here
you get it okay let's go

580
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:20,759
you get it okay let's go
 

581
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,710
you get it okay let's go
back and let's put this where it

582
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720

 

583
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:38,230

goes that was conscious move

584
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240

 

585
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,309

it okay last one was conscious movement

586
