00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
you after normal I practice night you go
 

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,469
you after normal I practice night you go

normally so so that's natural and I

00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
normally so so that's natural and I
 

71
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,590
normally so so that's natural and I
still get that today I still get it

72
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
still get that today I still get it
 

73
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,870
still get that today I still get it
today

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,270
today
what I'm saying for personal practice if

76
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
what I'm saying for personal practice if
 

77
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,830
what I'm saying for personal practice if
you've got a back door or you've got a

78
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
you've got a back door or you've got a
 

79
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,709
you've got a back door or you've got a
little space where you can swing that or

80
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:07,719
little space where you can swing that or
 

81
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:19,509
little space where you can swing that or
you J

82
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519

 

83
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,949

but see I had this Theory by doing it

84
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
but see I had this Theory by doing it
 

85
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,270
but see I had this Theory by doing it
slowly I could get the

86
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280

 

87
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,710

foot to land at the same time as

88
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720

 

89
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,070

can and at first the foot's there first

90
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
can and at first the foot's there first
 

91
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,470
can and at first the foot's there first
then the K or Ken first and then you

92
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,480
then the K or Ken first and then you
 

93
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,270
then the K or Ken first and then you
bring the foot out so I would spend

94
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,280
bring the foot out so I would spend
 

95
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,949
bring the foot out so I would spend
these little pieces in the daytime at

96
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
these little pieces in the daytime at
 

97
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,550
these little pieces in the daytime at
night

98
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:47,560

 

99
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,390

going and you know you might stagger a

100
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
going and you know you might stagger a
 

101
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,990
going and you know you might stagger a
bit

102
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000

 

103
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,750

or quickly bring your foot out so you'll

104
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
or quickly bring your foot out so you'll
 

105
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,190
or quickly bring your foot out so you'll
go through all these mental

106
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
go through all these mental
 

107
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,710
go through all these mental
processes but then event usually you

108
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
processes but then event usually you
 

109
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,990
processes but then event usually you
won't work out your foots you got too

110
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,000
won't work out your foots you got too
 

111
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,830
won't work out your foots you got too
much weight on your front foot you can't

112
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:04,840
much weight on your front foot you can't
 

113
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,550
much weight on your front foot you can't
you're

114
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,560

 

115
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,030

just so if I'm doing what Alex was doing

116
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
just so if I'm doing what Alex was doing
 

117
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,630
just so if I'm doing what Alex was doing
going backwards I use that power to

118
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:19,640
going backwards I use that power to
 

119
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,990
going backwards I use that power to
bring the Ken

120
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
bring the Ken
 

121
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,309
bring the Ken
backwards forwards is the is the result

122
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
backwards forwards is the is the result
 

123
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,630
backwards forwards is the is the result
of the going

124
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:27,640
of the going
 

125
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,070
of the going
backward if you go backward

126
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,080
backward if you go backward
 

127
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,750
backward if you go backward
and then go forwards foots first then

128
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
and then go forwards foots first then
 

129
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,550
and then go forwards foots first then
the cut you've got Thomas's problem

130
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
the cut you've got Thomas's problem
 

131
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,710
the cut you've got Thomas's problem
where you're trying to cor so much that

132
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
where you're trying to cor so much that
 

133
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,910
where you're trying to cor so much that
you're actually throwing it out more

134
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
you're actually throwing it out more
 

135
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,630
you're actually throwing it out more
than you

136
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,640

 

137
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,149

are you can all if the foot gets they're

138
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
are you can all if the foot gets they're
 

139
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,550
are you can all if the foot gets they're
too quick there a little trick that I

140
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
too quick there a little trick that I
 

141
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,270
too quick there a little trick that I
used to do foots they're too quick I

142
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
used to do foots they're too quick I
 

143
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,910
used to do foots they're too quick I
used to keep the heel

144
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:52,920
used to keep the heel
 

145
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,350
used to keep the heel
up and let the heel go down last so that

146
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
up and let the heel go down last so that
 

147
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,350
up and let the heel go down last so that
would satisfy me that

148
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360

 

149
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:16,789

right I'm coordinating the last part

150
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799

 

151
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,990

any and then it becomes enjoyable but

152
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
any and then it becomes enjoyable but
 

153
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,710
any and then it becomes enjoyable but
that's talking to you after 49

154
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:23,720
that's talking to you after 49
 

155
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,469
that's talking to you after 49
years um but I also give you the answer

156
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:27,479
years um but I also give you the answer
 

157
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,909
years um but I also give you the answer
that my student

158
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
that my student
 

159
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,070
that my student
got a massive amount within four months

160
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080
got a massive amount within four months
 

161
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,390
got a massive amount within four months
so it doesn't take you 50 years it just

162
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
so it doesn't take you 50 years it just
 

163
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,510
so it doesn't take you 50 years it just
you got to work

164
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520

 

165
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,590

out so this is the foot again if it gets

166
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:42,600
out so this is the foot again if it gets
 

167
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,590
out so this is the foot again if it gets
too quick keep the heel up push it down

168
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600

 

169
