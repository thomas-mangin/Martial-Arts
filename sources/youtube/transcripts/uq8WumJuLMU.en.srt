00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,770

so let's go back to title intro and

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:03,780
so let's go back to title intro and
 

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:12,860
so let's go back to title intro and
we're gonna take out its role as a push

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:12,870
we're gonna take out its role as a push
 

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,320
we're gonna take out its role as a push
right so we're gonna have them ease up

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,330
right so we're gonna have them ease up
 

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,680
right so we're gonna have them ease up
on the push but yes it keep this prompt

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,690
on the push but yes it keep this prompt
 

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,349
on the push but yes it keep this prompt
I want you to pay attention to the point

10
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
I want you to pay attention to the point
 

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,820
I want you to pay attention to the point
in space that my elbow is this elbow

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:25,830
in space that my elbow is this elbow
 

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,070
in space that my elbow is this elbow
will go forward continually in its

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,080
will go forward continually in its
 

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,350
will go forward continually in its
pattern so it's going to turn this way

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
pattern so it's going to turn this way
 

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,639
pattern so it's going to turn this way
so here's my point my elbows point in

18
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:40,649
so here's my point my elbows point in
 

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,090
so here's my point my elbows point in
space and it moves forward into that

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
space and it moves forward into that
 

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,279
space and it moves forward into that
pattern making this wrong so it's not

22
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:52,289
pattern making this wrong so it's not
 

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,470
pattern making this wrong so it's not
going to go backwards it's not going to

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
going to go backwards it's not going to
 

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,340
going to go backwards it's not going to
go down it's going to go forward into

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,350
go down it's going to go forward into
 

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,920

the pattern this pattern is a circular
 

29
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,530
the pattern this pattern is a circular
so my elbow is not going to draw a

30
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:09,540
so my elbow is not going to draw a
 

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,020
so my elbow is not going to draw a
straight line here so it's moving

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,030
straight line here so it's moving
 

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,929
straight line here so it's moving
forward on the pattern a step to keep it

on to the curve do you see that so if I

98
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,340
on to the curve do you see that so if I
 

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,600
on to the curve do you see that so if I
push here the elbow is going in a

straight line that was not the problem
 

103
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,730
straight line that was not the problem
okay when I go into straight line at

higher speeds that would be a clash and
 

107
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,560
higher speeds that would be a clash and
you would be bounced off if he had way

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,570
you would be bounced off if he had way
 

109
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,410
you would be bounced off if he had way
more could generate more cookie okay

00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,739
you let it move that way and then you
step where the elbow pattern needs it

164
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:02,749
step where the elbow pattern needs it
 

165
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:06,819
step where the elbow pattern needs it
you see it's all free space here and I'm

166
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:06,829
you see it's all free space here and I'm
 

167
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,850
you see it's all free space here and I'm
pivot on a single pivot point the back

168
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:09,860
pivot on a single pivot point the back
 

169
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,879

leg there's no weight on the other leg

170
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:12,889
leg there's no weight on the other leg
 

171
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:20,259
leg there's no weight on the other leg
which is why it can move so immediately

172
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:20,269
which is why it can move so immediately
 

173
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:24,489
which is why it can move so immediately
he goes this way I step to keep the

174
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:24,499
he goes this way I step to keep the
 

175
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,359
he goes this way I step to keep the
pattern going on the elbow single pivot

pattern going on the elbow single pivot
 

177
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:36,850
pattern going on the elbow single pivot
point then step to keep it that's where

178
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:36,860
point then step to keep it that's where
 

179
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,350
point then step to keep it that's where
he wants to go step to keep the pattern

180
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,360
he wants to go step to keep the pattern
 

181
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,689
he wants to go step to keep the pattern
do you see how I shifting weight come

182
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:43,699
do you see how I shifting weight come
 

183
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,489
do you see how I shifting weight come
back

184

watch me double pivot here's the gear I

186
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:47,389
watch me double pivot here's the gear I
 

187
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,929
watch me double pivot here's the gear I
step I'm going to double pivot now I'm

188
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:49,939
step I'm going to double pivot now I'm
 

189
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,659
step I'm going to double pivot now I'm
going to pull them you see that when I

190
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:52,669
going to pull them you see that when I
 

191
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,939
going to pull them you see that when I
shift weight onto the other leg I'm on

192
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:54,949
shift weight onto the other leg I'm on
 

193
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,069

the other side of the axis of rotation

194
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:57,079
the other side of the axis of rotation
 

195
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:05,139
the other side of the axis of rotation
so there's the hole for the EDB step

196
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:05,149
so there's the hole for the EDB step
 

197
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,389
so there's the hole for the EDB step
into it keep it going

198
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:07,399
into it keep it going
 

199
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,219
into it keep it going
don't double pivot here you're gonna

200
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:09,229
don't double pivot here you're gonna
 

201
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:16,250
don't double pivot here you're gonna
pull him shift weight on the line

202

203
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,440

that will allow this leg this is

204
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,450
that will allow this leg this is
 

205
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:29,800
that will allow this leg this is
dreaming here but mostly you like that

206
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:29,810

 

207
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,850

you see how it gets kind of tight in

248
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,350
you see how it gets kind of tight in
 

249
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,010
you see how it gets kind of tight in
there you see that right right in there

there you see that right right in there
 

251
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,390
there you see that right right in there
and I kind of hovering on the surface of

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,070
that pressure the mistake that some of
 

255
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,040
that pressure the mistake that some of
you were making at first was you cross

256
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,050
you were making at first was you cross
 

257
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,210

the pressure line you see okay to help

258
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,220
the pressure line you see okay to help
 

259
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,740
the pressure line you see okay to help
me not get so tight there I'm going to

260
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:40,750
me not get so tight there I'm going to
 

261
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,630
me not get so tight there I'm going to
keep the same pattern the same thing

262
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
keep the same pattern the same thing
 

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,140
keep the same pattern the same thing
that makes the center go this way but I

264
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,150
that makes the center go this way but I
 

265
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,860
that makes the center go this way but I
rotate my arm harmoniously with the top

266
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:49,870
rotate my arm harmoniously with the top
 

267
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,180
rotate my arm harmoniously with the top
you see that so there is the outer

268
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,190
you see that so there is the outer
 

269
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,060
you see that so there is the outer
spiral of the overall pattern and then

270
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,070
spiral of the overall pattern and then
 

271
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,960
spiral of the overall pattern and then
an interior spiral of the arm for

272
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:01,970
an interior spiral of the arm for
 

273
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,400
an interior spiral of the arm for
okay so we're here and how you can tell

274
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,410
okay so we're here and how you can tell
 

275
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,730
okay so we're here and how you can tell
is that his grip is going to go up

276
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:09,740
is that his grip is going to go up
 

277
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,040
is that his grip is going to go up
underneath okay

278
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,050
underneath okay
 

279
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,400
underneath okay
now the problem is if I go underneath

280
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,410
now the problem is if I go underneath
 

281
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,980
now the problem is if I go underneath
look what happened to my alma mater he

282
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:17,990
look what happened to my alma mater he
 

283
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,290
look what happened to my alma mater he
came across and disclosed this base

284
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:20,300
came across and disclosed this base
 

285
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,129
came across and disclosed this base
closed here so you can't turn all at

286
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:24,139
closed here so you can't turn all at
 

287
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,939
closed here so you can't turn all at
once and it can't turn independently of

288
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:27,949
once and it can't turn independently of
 

289
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:33,309
once and it can't turn independently of
the hip so as the elbow goes down they

290
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:33,319
the hip so as the elbow goes down they
 

291
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,579
the hip so as the elbow goes down they
hit turns to keep the length do you see

292
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:36,589
hit turns to keep the length do you see
 

293
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,829
hit turns to keep the length do you see
that and then everything is the same so

294
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
that and then everything is the same so
 

295
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,509
that and then everything is the same so
we're going to do it static at first

296
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
we're going to do it static at first
 

297
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,429
we're going to do it static at first
meaning but she's already pushed into

298
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:45,439
meaning but she's already pushed into
 

299
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:51,220
meaning but she's already pushed into
them okay now I do the hip and this

300
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,230
them okay now I do the hip and this
 

301
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,160
them okay now I do the hip and this
elbow drops underneath that's it that's

302
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,170
elbow drops underneath that's it that's
 

303
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,129
elbow drops underneath that's it that's
all I need right there and then I keep

304
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:57,139
all I need right there and then I keep
 

305
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:05,259
all I need right there and then I keep
the pattern go hip elbow connection hip

306
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:05,269
the pattern go hip elbow connection hip
 

307
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,369
the pattern go hip elbow connection hip
forward elbow down now hold down if you

308
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:09,379
forward elbow down now hold down if you
 

309
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,650
forward elbow down now hold down if you
exaggerated it too much that elbow

310
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:11,660
exaggerated it too much that elbow
 

311
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,240
exaggerated it too much that elbow
linesman cut across

312
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
linesman cut across
 

313
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,900
linesman cut across
so it's very small that's it that was it

314
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:16,910
so it's very small that's it that was it
 

315
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:27,160
so it's very small that's it that was it
right there that's it and once you get

316
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,170
right there that's it and once you get
 

317
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,439
right there that's it and once you get
it you can now start bending the time at

318
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:29,449
it you can now start bending the time at
 

319
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,660
it you can now start bending the time at
home was right and that way there's no

320
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:33,670
home was right and that way there's no
 

321
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:42,280
home was right and that way there's no
boom he goes right into it and boom we

322
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,290
boom he goes right into it and boom we
 

323
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,940
boom he goes right into it and boom we

and that's not gonna push hard see that

360
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:47,139
and that's not gonna push hard see that
 

361
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:53,550

to see my difference okay so you have to

362
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:53,560
to see my difference okay so you have to
 

363
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,179
to see my difference okay so you have to
watch that pattern the other thing don't

364
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:00,189
watch that pattern the other thing don't
 

365
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,660
watch that pattern the other thing don't
and you're going to do that every time

366
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,670
and you're going to do that every time
 

367
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,079
and you're going to do that every time
you do this every time or every time you

368
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:07,089
you do this every time or every time you
 

369
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,619
you do this every time or every time you
ask too much of your hip rotation do you

see everything has this natural

372
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:12,579
see everything has this natural
 

373
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,230
see everything has this natural
beginning and natural end so there was

374
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
beginning and natural end so there was
 

375
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,999

379
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:25,319

far you see it now it messed up so it

380
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:25,329
far you see it now it messed up so it
 

381
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,439
far you see it now it messed up so it
has its lifecycle aside from its pattern

382

has its lifecycle aside from its pattern
 

383
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,090

so the same thing here

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,260

 

485
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,770

I changed the distance between my

486
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:20,780
I changed the distance between my
 

487
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,799
I changed the distance between my
ribcage and my elbow and that elbow now

488
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:23,809
ribcage and my elbow and that elbow now
 

489
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,449
ribcage and my elbow and that elbow now
starts to move linearly across okay so

490
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:28,459
starts to move linearly across okay so
 

491
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,760
starts to move linearly across okay so
we're here first move I'm not staying in

492
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:33,770
we're here first move I'm not staying in
 

493
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,000
we're here first move I'm not staying in
connection to my elbow but to what end

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,010
connection to my elbow but to what end
 

495
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,510
connection to my elbow but to what end
what would be too much if that was too

496
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
what would be too much if that was too
 

497
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,950
what would be too much if that was too
far whatever laughs yeah what okay G

498
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:47,960
far whatever laughs yeah what okay G
 

499
00:17:47,960 --> 00:18:02,230
far whatever laughs yeah what okay G
when why would it go in oh why

500
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240

 

501
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,369

okay say there that's right okay

502
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:08,379
okay say there that's right okay
 

503
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,379
okay say there that's right okay
remember I wanted to be neutral I'm not

504
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:11,389
remember I wanted to be neutral I'm not
 

505
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:14,409
remember I wanted to be neutral I'm not
pulling I'm not pushing and not young

506
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:14,419
pulling I'm not pushing and not young
 

507
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:20,169
pulling I'm not pushing and not young
I'm not yet I'm zero pressure okay so I

508
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:20,179
I'm not yet I'm zero pressure okay so I
 

509
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,970
I'm not yet I'm zero pressure okay so I
do the first part whoa

510
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:21,980
do the first part whoa
 

511
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,639
do the first part whoa
and I step to keep zero pressure so

512
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:24,649
and I step to keep zero pressure so
 

513
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:26,499
and I step to keep zero pressure so
stepping over here I felt that increase

514
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:26,509
stepping over here I felt that increase
 

515
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,539
stepping over here I felt that increase
the dog can't step there if I step over

516
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:28,549
the dog can't step there if I step over
 

517
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,730
the dog can't step there if I step over
here I feel it decrease too much so I

518
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:30,740
here I feel it decrease too much so I
 

519
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,009
here I feel it decrease too much so I
step over here to keep it going around

520
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:33,019
step over here to keep it going around
 

521
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:37,989
step over here to keep it going around
you get that okay now let's free your

522
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:37,999
you get that okay now let's free your
 

523
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:42,609
you get that okay now let's free your
mind why when I have this 12 the six

524
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:42,619
mind why when I have this 12 the six
 

525
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:47,039
mind why when I have this 12 the six
line and my going on the negative side

526
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,049
line and my going on the negative side
 

527
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,100
line and my going on the negative side
do you see I step too far out why why

528
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,110
do you see I step too far out why why
 

529
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,980
do you see I step too far out why why
why would it be gonna do that

530
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:56,990
why would it be gonna do that
 

531
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,350
why would it be gonna do that
yeah yeah your mind is stuck on the

532
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
yeah yeah your mind is stuck on the
 

533
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,350
yeah yeah your mind is stuck on the
original 12 to 6 line do you understand

534
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,360
original 12 to 6 line do you understand
 

535
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,500
original 12 to 6 line do you understand
ok but what what was the 10 of the 12 to

536
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,510
ok but what what was the 10 of the 12 to
 

537
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,130
ok but what what was the 10 of the 12 to
6 line even when you got stuck on it I

538
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,140
6 line even when you got stuck on it I
 

539
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,220
6 line even when you got stuck on it I
this wasn't right you see that that was

540
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,230
this wasn't right you see that that was
 

541
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,570
this wasn't right you see that that was
not right why was that wrong do this

542
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:16,580
not right why was that wrong do this
 

543
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,210
not right why was that wrong do this
more than you need right is too much of

544
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,220
more than you need right is too much of
 

545
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,870
more than you need right is too much of
a break this side so you set only what

546
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
a break this side so you set only what
 

547
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,200
a break this side so you set only what
you needed to do so for example if he's

548
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,210
you needed to do so for example if he's
 

549
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,630
you needed to do so for example if he's
doing ski right I only need that pitch I

550
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:33,640
doing ski right I only need that pitch I
 

551
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,870
doing ski right I only need that pitch I
don't go like this

552
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
don't go like this
 

553
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,899
don't go like this
right ok so even if I don't understand 0

554
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:42,909
right ok so even if I don't understand 0
 

555
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:48,430
right ok so even if I don't understand 0
the line excessively but as I said what

556
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,440
the line excessively but as I said what
 

557
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,710
the line excessively but as I said what
it's important is right now I have a

558
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
it's important is right now I have a
 

559
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,649
it's important is right now I have a
conflict which is why he's on 12 and I'm

560
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:53,659
conflict which is why he's on 12 and I'm
 

561
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,490
conflict which is why he's on 12 and I'm
on 6

562
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,500
on 6
 

563
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,430
on 6
what if I wasn't on 6 and I became the

564
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
what if I wasn't on 6 and I became the
 

565
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,480
what if I wasn't on 6 and I became the
middle of the claw you understand now I

566
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,490
middle of the claw you understand now I
 

567
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,649
middle of the claw you understand now I
don't have 12 opposing 6 so whoa I come

568
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:05,659
don't have 12 opposing 6 so whoa I come
 

569
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,840
don't have 12 opposing 6 so whoa I come
around here and you see at this moment

570
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:07,850
around here and you see at this moment
 

571
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,510
around here and you see at this moment
if you took a picture you wouldn't know

572
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:10,520
if you took a picture you wouldn't know
 

573
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,389
if you took a picture you wouldn't know
which technique that was but you can

574
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:13,399
which technique that was but you can
 

575
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:19,630
which technique that was but you can
tell he's going around me easy so get

576
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:19,640
tell he's going around me easy so get
 

577
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,480
tell he's going around me easy so get
off the oppositional geometry you're

578
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,490
off the oppositional geometry you're
 

579
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,060
off the oppositional geometry you're
trying to reconcile the 12 to 6 conflict

580
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,070
trying to reconcile the 12 to 6 conflict
 

581
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,120
trying to reconcile the 12 to 6 conflict
whoa whoa he's going around you okay so

582
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,130
whoa whoa he's going around you okay so
 

583
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,940
whoa whoa he's going around you okay so
you have to step in that's generally

584
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:33,950
you have to step in that's generally
 

585
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,560
you have to step in that's generally
what's going to have to happen for you

586
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:35,570
what's going to have to happen for you
 

587
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,200
what's going to have to happen for you
to keep the pattern whoa you're going to

588
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,210
to keep the pattern whoa you're going to
 

589
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,019
to keep the pattern whoa you're going to
have to go here across you see how

590
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:41,029
have to go here across you see how
 

591
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,240
have to go here across you see how
across with all the same and I keep

592
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,250
across with all the same and I keep
 

593
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,240
across with all the same and I keep
turning that way he goes around me go

594
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,250
turning that way he goes around me go
 

595
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,289
turning that way he goes around me go
back hey whoa when I go like this he's

596
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:50,299
back hey whoa when I go like this he's
 

597
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,780
back hey whoa when I go like this he's
not going around me you see that and not

598
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:52,790
not going around me you see that and not
 

599
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,940
not going around me you see that and not
Rahmi and as I call them okay let's go

600
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:56,950
Rahmi and as I call them okay let's go
 

601
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:06,250
Rahmi and as I call them okay let's go
so your heart is always made up of let's

602
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,260
so your heart is always made up of let's
 

603
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,850
so your heart is always made up of let's
just generalize it okay so when I took

604
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:09,860
just generalize it okay so when I took
 

605
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,710
just generalize it okay so when I took
when I come here to sit the same

606
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
when I come here to sit the same
 

607
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,190
when I come here to sit the same
mechanics that allow me not to pull and

608
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
mechanics that allow me not to pull and
 

609
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,570
mechanics that allow me not to pull and
to put to push him through the pattern

610
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:19,580
to put to push him through the pattern
 

611
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,800
to put to push him through the pattern
and thus a mechanics that take his bowel

612
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:23,810
and thus a mechanics that take his bowel
 

613
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,020
and thus a mechanics that take his bowel
is there which keep it moving forward

614
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,030
is there which keep it moving forward
 

615
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,280
is there which keep it moving forward
right

616
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,290
right
 

617
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,460
right
is this a mechanic's that made me be

618
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,470
is this a mechanic's that made me be
 

619
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,700
is this a mechanic's that made me be
bhai or if you want a head on the spiral

620
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:33,710
bhai or if you want a head on the spiral
 

621
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,270
bhai or if you want a head on the spiral
at the contention point so he can't push

622
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
at the contention point so he can't push
 

623
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,810
at the contention point so he can't push
on me okay so what do I mean by that so

624
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:40,820
on me okay so what do I mean by that so
 

625
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,130
on me okay so what do I mean by that so
as he's falling that way do you see and

626
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,140
as he's falling that way do you see and
 

627
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,580
as he's falling that way do you see and
as I move this way this you can if I

628
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,590
as I move this way this you can if I
 

629
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,350
as I move this way this you can if I
stay here you can push on it you can

630
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:50,360
stay here you can push on it you can
 

631
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,050
stay here you can push on it you can
push on me see but we're going to keep

632
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,060
push on me see but we're going to keep
 

633
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,720
push on me see but we're going to keep
moving and now I'm past the contention

634
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:55,730
moving and now I'm past the contention
 

635
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,880
moving and now I'm past the contention
point you see and the only way he can

636
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:57,890
point you see and the only way he can
 

637
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,490
point you see and the only way he can
push now is to do what he has to push

638
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:00,500
push now is to do what he has to push
 

639
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,620
push now is to do what he has to push
back but he can't push back on because

640
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:02,630
back but he can't push back on because
 

641
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,480
back but he can't push back on because
he was going forward I could get that

642
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,490
he was going forward I could get that
 

643
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,290

back the only way you can pull is if

644
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,300
back the only way you can pull is if
 

645
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,810
back the only way you can pull is if
you're on the other side of that spiral

646
