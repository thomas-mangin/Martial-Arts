we know this part
 

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,030
we know this part
it's just like yesterday's technique

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
it's just like yesterday's technique
 

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,910
it's just like yesterday's technique
okay

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
okay

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,469

and then i let it turn

28
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479

 

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,830

we don't have to talk about that part

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
we don't have to talk about that part
 

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,830
we don't have to talk about that part
that was yesterday

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
that was yesterday

all right
 

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,069
all right
look you have to yield

36
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
look you have to yield
 

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,310
look you have to yield
and you have to establish a ground path

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
and you have to establish a ground path
 

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,749
and you have to establish a ground path
you don't stand here

40
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
you don't stand here
 

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,590
you don't stand here

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,910
turn
so

50
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
so
 

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,870
so
what

52
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880

do i mean no

54
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
do i mean no

no yield

58
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
no yield
 

59
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,670
no yield
then

60
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
then
 

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,190
then
whoa

62
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
whoa
 

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,749
whoa
no balance when you're double weighted

64
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
no balance when you're double weighted
 

65
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,590
no balance when you're double weighted
and then it gets worse when you pivot

66
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
and then it gets worse when you pivot
 

67
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,510
and then it gets worse when you pivot

you don't do that you don't pivot double

70
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
you don't do that you don't pivot double
 

71
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,270
you don't do that you don't pivot double
weighted you never

72
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280

73
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,230

like that now

82
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040

 

83
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,869

that's why you see all those people

84
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879

 

85
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,949

single pivot point
 

87
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,990
single pivot point
turns on the single pivot point

88
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
turns on the single pivot point
 

89
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,070
turns on the single pivot point
to the other two quite nicely

90
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080

 

91
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,350

95
00:02:48,080 --> 00:03:00,229

different

96
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239

 

97
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,949

let's get this single pizza box

98
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
let's get this single pizza box
 

99
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,750
let's get this single pizza box
on that turn before going on

100
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
on that turn before going on
 

101
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,390
on that turn before going on
okay now that you have a single pivot

102
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
okay now that you have a single pivot
 

103
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,229
okay now that you have a single pivot
point you can turn quite a bit

104
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
point you can turn quite a bit
 

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,470
point you can turn quite a bit
go way past the

106
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
go way past the
 

107
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,110
go way past the
180.

108
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
180.
 

109
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,270
180.
so once you've given yourself that

110
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
so once you've given yourself that
 

111
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,390
so once you've given yourself that
capacity you're going to turn

112
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
capacity you're going to turn
 

113
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,750
capacity you're going to turn
into him

114
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
into him
 

115
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,390
into him
this is not enough this technique is not

116
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
this is not enough this technique is not
 

117
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,670
this is not enough this technique is not
lined up

118
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
lined up
 

119
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,589
lined up
turn into him

120
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
turn into him
 

121
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,390
turn into him
here is the edibi angle if you pay

122
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
here is the edibi angle if you pay
 

123
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,430
here is the edibi angle if you pay
attention so here i was and i'm going to

124
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440

do er eating me nugget
can you see

128
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
can you see
 

129
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,350
can you see
that means he's in the back

130
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
that means he's in the back
 

131
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,869
that means he's in the back
outward kazushi if i go over here

132
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
outward kazushi if i go over here
 

133
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,509
outward kazushi if i go over here
and i try to do it you can oh no that's

134
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
and i try to do it you can oh no that's
 

135
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,910
and i try to do it you can oh no that's
not it okay

136
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
not it okay
 

137
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,070
not it okay
so you're gonna turn

138
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
so you're gonna turn
 

139
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,350

looking at him
 

145
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,270
looking at him
cut it not here

146
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280

 

147
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,869

so same single pivot

148
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
so same single pivot
 

149
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,550
so same single pivot
all the way into him

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
all the way into him
 

151
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,149
all the way into him
looking right at him you were in the

152
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
looking right at him you were in the
 

153
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,110
looking right at him you were in the
back do you see go in the back

154
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
back do you see go in the back
 

155
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,710
back do you see go in the back
okay

156
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
okay
 

157
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,189
okay
go all the way around go

158
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199

 

159
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,870

oh if i do tenshi nugget yeah

160
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
oh if i do tenshi nugget yeah
 

161
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,469
oh if i do tenshi nugget yeah
outward kazushi do you see

162
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
outward kazushi do you see
 

163
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,310
outward kazushi do you see
that means his energy is going which way

164
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
that means his energy is going which way
 

165
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,230
that means his energy is going which way
forward

166
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
forward
 

167
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,110
forward
his energy is going forward

168
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120

 

169
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,510

well i'm not going to change that

170
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
well i'm not going to change that
 

171
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,230
well i'm not going to change that
i'm not going to go here

172
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
i'm not going to go here
 

173
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,270
i'm not going to go here
and he's going backwards

174
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280

 

175
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,390

so

176
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
so
 

177
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,870
so
what why as i keep turning

178
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
what why as i keep turning
 

179
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,510
what why as i keep turning
i'm keeping him

180
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
i'm keeping him
 

181
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,469
i'm keeping him
so that his center keeps going up

182
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
so that his center keeps going up
 

183
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,430
so that his center keeps going up
okay now we gotta figure out how

184
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440

then you can pin

432
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
then you can pin
 

433
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,150

and you can strike he's under you okay
 

435
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,990
and you can strike he's under you okay
let's try it

436
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000

 

437
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,190

i made me a fallen body
 

441
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,310
i made me a fallen body
the reason i stay up with him is because

442
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
the reason i stay up with him is because
 

443
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,310

somewhere long before you get to what

450
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
somewhere long before you get to what
 

451
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,030
somewhere long before you get to what
you recognize as the fall he was already

452
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
you recognize as the fall he was already
 

453
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,750

if i'm doing the other
 

457
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,350
if i'm doing the other
accelerations

458
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
accelerations
 

459
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,990
accelerations
he's not falling yet you see you have to

460
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
he's not falling yet you see you have to
 

461
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,069
he's not falling yet you see you have to
pull and pull and pull

463
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,790

but if you get for example the body lock

464
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
but if you get for example the body lock
 

465
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,710
but if you get for example the body lock
he's already calling

466
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
he's already calling
 

467
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,150
he's already calling
he said

468
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
he said
 

469
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,990
he said
i just stayed up with him

470
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
i just stayed up with him
 

471
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,310
i just stayed up with him
and then aimed him

472
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
and then aimed him
 

473
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,710
and then aimed him
intentionally

474
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720

 

475
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,430

he was already followed okay that way i

476
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
he was already followed okay that way i
 

477
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,190
he was already followed okay that way i
can enter because he's going into a yin

478
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
can enter because he's going into a yin
 

479
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,310
can enter because he's going into a yin
phase

480
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
phase
 

481
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,629
phase
all right same exactly here

482
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
all right same exactly here
 

483
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,030
all right same exactly here
whoa

484
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040

 

485
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:43,030

you just had to do the same body

486
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040

 

487
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,910

okay

488
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
okay
 

489
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,910
okay
let's see what we get because i have a

490
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
let's see what we get because i have a
 

491
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,350
let's see what we get because i have a
feeling some of you are still pulling

492
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
feeling some of you are still pulling
 

493
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,629
feeling some of you are still pulling
him down

494
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
him down
 

495
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,710
him down
and that's why he's going away from you

496
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
and that's why he's going away from you
 

497
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,030
and that's why he's going away from you
because you're accelerating him which

498
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
because you're accelerating him which
 

499
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,069
because you're accelerating him which
means you

500
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
means you
 

501
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,629
means you
are increasing his velocity in a

502
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
are increasing his velocity in a
 

503
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,110
are increasing his velocity in a
direction away from you that's why he's

504
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
direction away from you that's why he's
 

505
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,079
direction away from you that's why he's
not underneath you okay
