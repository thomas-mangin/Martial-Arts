00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,990

thing to remember is the art is

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,000
thing to remember is the art is
 

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,030
thing to remember is the art is
concentric and throughout the centuries

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,040
concentric and throughout the centuries
 

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,230
concentric and throughout the centuries
a good way of understanding that is is

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,240
a good way of understanding that is is
 

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,150
a good way of understanding that is is

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,920

contestation

12
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:22,599
contestation
 

13
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,750
contestation
internally you're not supposed to have

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
internally you're not supposed to have
 

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,830
internally you're not supposed to have
contestation

16
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
contestation
 

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,710
contestation
externally um no matter how much much I

18
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
externally um no matter how much much I
 

19
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,709
externally um no matter how much much I
so for

20
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:31,719
so for
 

21
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,869
so for
example um I might use a cultivation

22
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,879
example um I might use a cultivation
 

23
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,709
example um I might use a cultivation
drill where he's pressing and he's

24
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
drill where he's pressing and he's
 

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,350
drill where he's pressing and he's
pushing okay with spinal displacement

26
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
pushing okay with spinal displacement
 

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,630
pushing okay with spinal displacement
and then I internalize that and that is

28
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
and then I internalize that and that is
 

29
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,950
and then I internalize that and that is
a way of developing that internally I'm

30
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:47,960
a way of developing that internally I'm
 

31
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,709
a way of developing that internally I'm
not contesting but externally this is a

32
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:51,719
not contesting but externally this is a
 

33
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,709
not contesting but externally this is a
contestation you see so hence the art

34
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
contestation you see so hence the art
 

35
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,750
contestation you see so hence the art
will move things so same thing

36
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,760
will move things so same thing
 

37
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,430
will move things so same thing
internally I'm doing the same uh yield

38
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,440
internally I'm doing the same uh yield
 

39
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,990
internally I'm doing the same uh yield
so for ex or the same internal non-c

40
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,000
so for ex or the same internal non-c
 

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,990
so for ex or the same internal non-c
conation so for example if he comes out

42
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
conation so for example if he comes out
 

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,270
conation so for example if he comes out
and he now pushes on that

44
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,280
and he now pushes on that
 

45
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,109
and he now pushes on that
angle it's not going anywhere do you see

46
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
angle it's not going anywhere do you see
 

47
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,350
angle it's not going anywhere do you see
I don't I

48
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
I don't I
 

49
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,350
I don't I
don't I think people make a mistake is

50
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
don't I think people make a mistake is
 

51
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,990
don't I think people make a mistake is
that they take a internal cultivation

52
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
that they take a internal cultivation
 

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,190
that they take a internal cultivation
field and then violated at the external

54
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,200
field and then violated at the external
 

55
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,870
field and then violated at the external
level this is not concentric thought

56
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
level this is not concentric thought
 

57
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,749
level this is not concentric thought
Okay so so just because I move into an

58
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
Okay so so just because I move into an
 

59
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,310
Okay so so just because I move into an
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm

60
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm
 

61
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,870
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm
not doing the same exact thing okay I am

62
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:39,880
not doing the same exact thing okay I am
 

63
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,469
not doing the same exact thing okay I am
doing the same exact thing internally

64
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
doing the same exact thing internally
 

65
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,670
doing the same exact thing internally
I'm just now concentrically consistent

66
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm just now concentrically consistent
 

67
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,469
I'm just now concentrically consistent
throughout my movement okay so you

68
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
throughout my movement okay so you
 

69
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,950
throughout my movement okay so you
have you have a uh

70
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
have you have a uh
 

71
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,190
have you have a uh
internal internalization so internally

72
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,200
internal internalization so internally
 

73
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,429
internal internalization so internally
I'm not contesting and you can do all of

74
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
I'm not contesting and you can do all of
 

75
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,709
I'm not contesting and you can do all of
this

76
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
this
 

77
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,709
this
you see on an external

78
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
you see on an external
 

79
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,630
you see on an external
contestation okay so all I'm doing here

80
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:07,640
contestation okay so all I'm doing here
 

81
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,389
contestation okay so all I'm doing here
is you're you're pushing at me and then

82
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
is you're you're pushing at me and then
 

83
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,710
is you're you're pushing at me and then
I remain internal and and I can just go

84
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:13,720
I remain internal and and I can just go
 

85
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,390
I remain internal and and I can just go
through you you see but that's not the

86
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
through you you see but that's not the
 

87
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,070
through you you see but that's not the
art okay because I'm just

88
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
art okay because I'm just
 

89
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,229
art okay because I'm just
pushing externally on this line okay so

90
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
pushing externally on this line okay so
 

91
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,309
pushing externally on this line okay so
I have to go around this point

92
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
I have to go around this point
 

93
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,630
I have to go around this point
you

94
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640

 

95
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,869

see and any point in the turn any point

96
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
see and any point in the turn any point
 

97
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,350
see and any point in the turn any point
in the turn so let's say we're here and

98
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
in the turn so let's say we're here and
 

99
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,830
in the turn so let's say we're here and
he comes

100
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
he comes
 

101
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,309
he comes
out it's the

102
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:45,319
out it's the
 

103
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,470
out it's the
same

104
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
same
 

105
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,190
same
okay there you

106
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
okay there you
 

107
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,190
okay there you
go comes

108
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
go comes
 

109
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,070
go comes
out it's the

110
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080

 

111
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,470

same and any angle so for example

112
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
same and any angle so for example
 

113
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,710
same and any angle so for example
here's this part come out sit

114
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720

 

115
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,990

up you

116
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
up you
 

117
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,190
up you
see so as you guys are getting able to

118
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,200
see so as you guys are getting able to
 

119
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,670
see so as you guys are getting able to
internalize their energy all you're

120
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680
internalize their energy all you're
 

121
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,750
internalize their energy all you're
doing with it now though is trying to be

122
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:20,760
doing with it now though is trying to be
 

123
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,670
doing with it now though is trying to be
more powerful you see so and so you're

124
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:24,680
more powerful you see so and so you're
 

125
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,509
more powerful you see so and so you're
like oh I'm going to put the quaw into

126
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
like oh I'm going to put the quaw into
 

127
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,949
like oh I'm going to put the quaw into
that and you're very powerful now but

128
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959
that and you're very powerful now but
 

129
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,910
that and you're very powerful now but
it's not the AR okay so I still use the

130
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
it's not the AR okay so I still use the
 

131
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,470
it's not the AR okay so I still use the
qua but I'm going around in you see and

132
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,480
qua but I'm going around in you see and
 

133
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,630
qua but I'm going around in you see and
it's extremely soft right okay and so

134
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:41,640
it's extremely soft right okay and so
 

135
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,030
it's extremely soft right okay and so
same thing here you can go here and drop

136
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
same thing here you can go here and drop
 

137
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,630
same thing here you can go here and drop
the chi do you

138
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
the chi do you
 

139
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,110
the chi do you
see but I I as I am not contesting so

140
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
see but I I as I am not contesting so
 

141
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,750
see but I I as I am not contesting so
same thing see feel that contesting

142
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
same thing see feel that contesting
 

143
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,309
same thing see feel that contesting
angle so I go this way you see okay well

144
00:03:59,309 --> 00:03:59,319
angle so I go this way you see okay well
 

145
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,429
angle so I go this way you see okay well
and then same thing here you're like

146
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
and then same thing here you're like
 

147
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,069
and then same thing here you're like
there oh I got you because I can qua the

148
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079
there oh I got you because I can qua the
 

149
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,869
there oh I got you because I can qua the
hell out of you do you see but look all

150
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
hell out of you do you see but look all
 

151
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,350
hell out of you do you see but look all
right you

152
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
right you
 

153
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,670
right you
see so if I can sum up this

154
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680
see so if I can sum up this
 

155
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,350
see so if I can sum up this
point

156
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,360
point
 

157
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,069
point
historically it's an concentric

00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:17,079
historically it's an concentric
 

159
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,550
historically it's an concentric
epistemology what you're doing on the

160
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
epistemology what you're doing on the
 

161
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,110
epistemology what you're doing on the
inside you have to do on the outside

162
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120

163
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,909
inside you have to do on the outside
you yes we do train for the inside

164
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:26,919
you yes we do train for the inside
 

165
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,070
you yes we do train for the inside
isolated from the outside but that's a

to do the whole thing okay so let's go
 

227
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,990
to do the whole thing okay so let's go
back to the Z to the Zen you you start

so the same thing as I do this my
 

233
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,870
so the same thing as I do this my
skeletal system is giving me the

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:27,880
skeletal system is giving me the
 

235
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,629
skeletal system is giving me the
feedback that I can feel my tissue

236
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
feedback that I can feel my tissue
 

237
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,350
feedback that I can feel my tissue
dropping okay you're giving me the

238
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
dropping okay you're giving me the
 

239
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,150
dropping okay you're giving me the
feedback by allowing me to follow that

240
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
feedback by allowing me to follow that
 

241
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,430

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
skeletal system is telling me let the
 

249
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,070
skeletal system is telling me let the
rest fall in contrast to that so you are

250
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,080
rest fall in contrast to that so you are
 

251
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,350
rest fall in contrast to that so you are
my contrast that's giving me my model to
