one's coming
is going to give you a kind of jab like

10
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,580
is going to give you a kind of jab like
 

11
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,129
is going to give you a kind of jab like
architecture but it's going to be able

12
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:16,139
architecture but it's going to be able
 

13
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,230
architecture but it's going to be able
to hit from the side where the chap has

14
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
to hit from the side where the chap has
 

15
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,830
to hit from the side where the chap has
to hit from the face of the target okay

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
to hit from the face of the target okay
 

17
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,570
to hit from the face of the target okay
um

18
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:23,580
um
 

19
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,029
um
again a Bay Point of origin but your

20
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:26,039
again a Bay Point of origin but your
 

21
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,070
again a Bay Point of origin but your
fist might be somewhere somewhere else

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
fist might be somewhere somewhere else
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,790
fist might be somewhere somewhere else
okay so if we're from our 5D stance

24
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
okay so if we're from our 5D stance
 

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,970
okay so if we're from our 5D stance
imagine there's a rope and it's going to

26
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:34,980
imagine there's a rope and it's going to
 

27
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,270
imagine there's a rope and it's going to
pull my fist boom

28
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
pull my fist boom
 

29
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,430
pull my fist boom
and you're gonna hit with these two

30
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:40,440
and you're gonna hit with these two
 

31
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,430
and you're gonna hit with these two
knuckles the top portion of them okay

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
knuckles the top portion of them okay
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,830
knuckles the top portion of them okay
they're not the front side like on a

34
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
they're not the front side like on a
 

35
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,990
they're not the front side like on a
punch or the top portion of those two

36
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
punch or the top portion of those two
 

37
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,190
punch or the top portion of those two
knuckles

38
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
knuckles
 

39
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,010
knuckles
uh some

40
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,020
uh some
 

41
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,290
uh some
it's a good one all that floating ribs

42
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,300
it's a good one all that floating ribs
 

43
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,290
it's a good one all that floating ribs
is a good one okay but we'll just work

44
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,300
is a good one okay but we'll just work
 

45
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,529
is a good one okay but we'll just work
it at the at the temple range okay it's

46
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:00,539
it at the at the temple range okay it's
 

47
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,810
it at the at the temple range okay it's
almost like the item so you don't want

48
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:02,820
almost like the item so you don't want
 

49
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,690
almost like the item so you don't want
to turn your hips into it no hips boom

50
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,700
to turn your hips into it no hips boom
 

51
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,490
to turn your hips into it no hips boom
will kind of go the other way to shove

52
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
will kind of go the other way to shove
 

53
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,289
will kind of go the other way to shove
that shoulder forward okay minimally

54
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:11,299
that shoulder forward okay minimally
 

55
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,649
that shoulder forward okay minimally
uh so to practice it you'll hold

56
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
uh so to practice it you'll hold
 

57
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,370
uh so to practice it you'll hold
the bag put that side back

58
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,380
the bag put that side back
 

59
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,070
the bag put that side back
okay and there's your target

60
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
okay and there's your target
 

61
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,130
okay and there's your target
and it's not a shot where you you're

62
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,140
and it's not a shot where you you're
 

63
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,050
and it's not a shot where you you're
going to try to send him flying it's

64
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,060
going to try to send him flying it's
 

65
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,510
going to try to send him flying it's
really a lot is how fast this strike

66
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
really a lot is how fast this strike
 

67
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,030
really a lot is how fast this strike
comes back boom bring the strike back

68
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040

 

69
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,130

don't plant the back foot you can only

70
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,140
don't plant the back foot you can only
 

71
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,109
don't plant the back foot you can only
ground off the ball of the foot because

72
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:42,119
ground off the ball of the foot because
 

73
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,810
ground off the ball of the foot because
you're rotating that heel to rotate the

74
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:44,820
you're rotating that heel to rotate the
 

75
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,330
you're rotating that heel to rotate the
claw and to extend the shoulder forward

76
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:49,340

 

77
00:01:49,340 --> 00:02:01,190

okay let's try

78

79
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,710

okay so he's gonna be in his stance all

80
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:03,720
okay so he's gonna be in his stance all
 

81
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,010
okay so he's gonna be in his stance all
right uh so just some applications he's

82
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020
right uh so just some applications he's
 

83
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,770
right uh so just some applications he's
doing his jab right you have your Pawn

84
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,780
doing his jab right you have your Pawn
 

85
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,830
doing his jab right you have your Pawn
techniques okay we're gonna pod into a

86
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
techniques okay we're gonna pod into a
 

87
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:22,729
techniques okay we're gonna pod into a
into that back knuckle underneath

88
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739

 

89
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,170

and then the leg

90
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,180

 

91
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,010

95
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,110

another great application for it is uh

96
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,120
another great application for it is uh

145
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,930
they're not made for that so you're kind
of just working the mechanics boom

146
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:20,940
of just working the mechanics boom
 

147
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,830
of just working the mechanics boom
boom

148
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840

 

149
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,990

you say I'm not trying to puncture the
 

151
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,570
you say I'm not trying to puncture the
back okay but I'm working the mechanics

152
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,580
back okay but I'm working the mechanics
 

153
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,270
back okay but I'm working the mechanics
comes out exactly the same and at the

154
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280
comes out exactly the same and at the
 

155
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,450
comes out exactly the same and at the
end it turns

156
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,460

 

157
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,909

159
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,189

because we're not going for power this

160
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:40,199
because we're not going for power this
 

161
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,050
because we're not going for power this
is a good opportunity to take that

162
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,060
is a good opportunity to take that
 

163
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,870
is a good opportunity to take that
tension off your body and working on

164
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
tension off your body and working on
 

165
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,810
tension off your body and working on
your ground Vector your claw turning

166
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:47,820
your ground Vector your claw turning
 

167
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,870
your ground Vector your claw turning
tension out of the shoulder

168
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
tension out of the shoulder
 

169
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,670
tension out of the shoulder
okay let's try it all right uh

170
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680
okay let's try it all right uh
 

171
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,790
okay let's try it all right uh
something on carrying it okay

172
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
something on carrying it okay
 

173
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,790
something on carrying it okay
you can disguise things by making them

174
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
you can disguise things by making them
 

175
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,930
you can disguise things by making them
look natural and what can't look natural

176
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:05,940
look natural and what can't look natural
 

177
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,810
look natural and what can't look natural
make the rest of what's around it look

178
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
make the rest of what's around it look
 

179
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,210
make the rest of what's around it look
unnatural and then it looks naturally

180
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,220
unnatural and then it looks naturally
 

181
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,510
unnatural and then it looks naturally
okay so if I'm holding this like that

182
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
okay so if I'm holding this like that
 

183
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,550
okay so if I'm holding this like that
it's I'm armed okay so uh but if I hold

184
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,560
it's I'm armed okay so uh but if I hold
 

185
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,710
it's I'm armed okay so uh but if I hold
it like this and the other hand is like

186
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:21,720
it like this and the other hand is like
 

187
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,129
it like this and the other hand is like
this do you see it still looks unnatural

188
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:25,139
this do you see it still looks unnatural
 

189
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,610
this do you see it still looks unnatural
but if I mimic it

190
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,620
but if I mimic it
 

191
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,129
but if I mimic it
Shield my body and mimic on the other

192
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
Shield my body and mimic on the other
 

193
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,350
Shield my body and mimic on the other
hand it's a little harder to tell what's

194
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
hand it's a little harder to tell what's
 

195
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,810
hand it's a little harder to tell what's
going on okay do you get that you still

196
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:35,820
going on okay do you get that you still
 

197
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,450
going on okay do you get that you still
see that I'll change it again

198
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:38,460
see that I'll change it again
 

199
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,670
see that I'll change it again
now it doesn't like do you see it change

200
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
now it doesn't like do you see it change
 

201
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,550
now it doesn't like do you see it change
it again okay so we're going to start

202
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,560
it again okay so we're going to start
 

203
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,830
it again okay so we're going to start
the technique from this from this

204
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
the technique from this from this
 

205
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,890
the technique from this from this
position okay when it comes to shielding

206
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:48,900
position okay when it comes to shielding
 

207
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,409
position okay when it comes to shielding
you have to understand where the 90 is

208
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:51,419
you have to understand where the 90 is
 

209
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,170
you have to understand where the 90 is
on your body okay and so you can't

210
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,180
on your body okay and so you can't
 

211
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,689
on your body okay and so you can't
Shield anything in front of that you

212
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:56,699
Shield anything in front of that you
 

213
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,150
Shield anything in front of that you
have to Shield behind that but you go

214
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,160
have to Shield behind that but you go
 

215
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,189
have to Shield behind that but you go
too far back now it looks unnatural you

216
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
too far back now it looks unnatural you
 

217
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,469
too far back now it looks unnatural you
see that so you're you're you've got to

218
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:03,479
see that so you're you're you've got to
 

219
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,710
see that so you're you're you've got to
play around at that uh 91 kind of degree

220
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
play around at that uh 91 kind of degree
 

221
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,590
play around at that uh 91 kind of degree
okay tension on your body so he has his

222
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
okay tension on your body so he has his
 

223
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,830
okay tension on your body so he has his
knife

224
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840

 

225
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,830

and we'll just work uh mosquito stomach

226
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
and we'll just work uh mosquito stomach
 

227
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,510
and we'll just work uh mosquito stomach
okay so okay

228
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,520

 

229
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,670

and we're just working

230
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
and we're just working
 

231
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,189
and we're just working
from that we'll go really slow I just

232
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
from that we'll go really slow I just
 

233
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,290
from that we'll go really slow I just
want you to work on the on the shielding

234
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,300
want you to work on the on the shielding
 

235
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,390
want you to work on the on the shielding
part okay

236
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
part okay
 

237
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,909
part okay
near that's what he's doing and then

238
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
near that's what he's doing and then
 

239
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,430
near that's what he's doing and then
we'll add our angle deflection so my

240
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
we'll add our angle deflection so my
 

241
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,469
we'll add our angle deflection so my
hand that's on the outside moves that to

242
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
hand that's on the outside moves that to
 

243
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,150
hand that's on the outside moves that to
the inside and I step to the outside

244
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
the inside and I step to the outside
 

245
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,870
the inside and I step to the outside
okay so here boom

246
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880

 

247
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,529

move

248
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539

 

249
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,749

poop and then the other knife is coming

250
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759
poop and then the other knife is coming
 

251
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,990
poop and then the other knife is coming
up at the bicep okay

252
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
up at the bicep okay
 

253
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:07,430
up at the bicep okay
so very relaxed

254
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440

 

255
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,770

and then from here up you have your

256
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:09,780
and then from here up you have your
 

257
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,010
and then from here up you have your
outward background okay don't get too

258
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,020
outward background okay don't get too
 

259
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,170
outward background okay don't get too
particular on where you hit like in the

260
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,180
particular on where you hit like in the

got it so just like the back knuckle
you're it's hard to fight

270
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
you're it's hard to fight
 

271
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,930
you're it's hard to fight
when a piece of Steel pushed your

272
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:29,940
when a piece of Steel pushed your
 

273
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,110
when a piece of Steel pushed your
eyeball out or there's you get it or

274
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
eyeball out or there's you get it or
 

275

00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
your nose is feel something or you get
 

277
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,610
your nose is feel something or you get
teeth knocked out you're already

278
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,620
teeth knocked out you're already
 

279
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,370
teeth knocked out you're already
increasing your odds do you see that so

280
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
increasing your odds do you see that so
 

281
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,430
increasing your odds do you see that so
just like if I if I was empty-handed oh

282
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
just like if I if I was empty-handed oh
 

283
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,890
just like if I if I was empty-handed oh
I just thrown it in his face you get

284
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:45,900
I just thrown it in his face you get
 

285
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,469
I just thrown it in his face you get
that tilt right and then you can attack

286
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
that tilt right and then you can attack
 

287
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,029
that tilt right and then you can attack
things okay

288
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,039
things okay
 

289
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,950
things okay
so don't

290
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:51,960
so don't
 

291
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,890
so don't
be stay loose okay we're here he goes

292
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:54,900
be stay loose okay we're here he goes
 

293
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,529
be stay loose okay we're here he goes
and just throw that back knuckle in the

294
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
and just throw that back knuckle in the
 

295
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,249
and just throw that back knuckle in the
face okay let's just get there try just

296
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:01,259
face okay let's just get there try just
 

297
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,230
face okay let's just get there try just
a couple things on this sand on point of

298
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
a couple things on this sand on point of
 

299
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,689
a couple things on this sand on point of
origin so when he's coming in I don't

300
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:05,699
origin so when he's coming in I don't
 

301
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,430
origin so when he's coming in I don't
want to turn my hand over and do the

302
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
want to turn my hand over and do the
 

303
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,330
want to turn my hand over and do the
pattern

304
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,340
pattern
 

305
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,909
pattern
my hand is here my this hand does the

306
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
my hand is here my this hand does the
 

307
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,010
my hand is here my this hand does the
pair

308
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
pair
 

309
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,990
pair
so on the Prairie I don't want to knock

310
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,000
so on the Prairie I don't want to knock
 

311
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,730
so on the Prairie I don't want to knock
his hand down either which is another

312
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:16,740
his hand down either which is another
 

313
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,409
his hand down either which is another
reason to go here because I'm trying to

314
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:18,419
reason to go here because I'm trying to
 

315
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,990
reason to go here because I'm trying to
go on the bicep I want his bicep to come

316
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,000
go on the bicep I want his bicep to come
 

317
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,510
go on the bicep I want his bicep to come
into me so

318
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
into me so
 

319
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,070
into me so
you see that then the knife will bite

320
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,080
you see that then the knife will bite
 

321
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,770
you see that then the knife will bite
deep okay

322
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,780
deep okay
 

323
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,469
deep okay
I'm not necessarily gonna Flip It Up

324
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
I'm not necessarily gonna Flip It Up
 

325
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,810
I'm not necessarily gonna Flip It Up
but I'm definitely not gonna knock it

326
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:32,820
but I'm definitely not gonna knock it
 

327
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,630
but I'm definitely not gonna knock it
down okay a couple of things happen

328
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
down okay a couple of things happen
 

329
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,449
down okay a couple of things happen
generally when you hit someone in the

330
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:38,459
generally when you hit someone in the
 

331
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,209
generally when you hit someone in the
bicep they tend to go ah

okay let's try it
all right come on the other side so you

412
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:41,640
all right come on the other side so you
 

413
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,190
all right come on the other side so you
all can see come on the other side of

417
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,449

it's the same thing like uh

418
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:53,459
it's the same thing like uh
 

419
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,210
it's the same thing like uh
the more you have to go into fixated

420
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,220
the more you have to go into fixated
 

421
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,650
the more you have to go into fixated
movement

422

flexion the slower you're going to be

426
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200
flexion the slower you're going to be
 

427
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,069
flexion the slower you're going to be
okay versus ballistically

428
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
okay versus ballistically
 

429
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,710
okay versus ballistically
ballistic move is going to be faster so

430
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:09,720
ballistic move is going to be faster so
 

431
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,990
ballistic move is going to be faster so
can you control somebody with Ballistic

432
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
can you control somebody with Ballistic
 

433
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,750
can you control somebody with Ballistic
movement or with minimal amount of

434
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
movement or with minimal amount of
 

435
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,790
movement or with minimal amount of
fixated movement that's going to be

436
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
fixated movement that's going to be
 

437
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,930
fixated movement that's going to be
better

438
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:17,940
better
 

439
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,250
better
than

440
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,260

and you see it just it you use your
 

455
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,610
and you see it just it you use your
adhesion in there instead on GG Noggin

adhesion in there instead on GG Noggin
 

457
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,370
adhesion in there instead on GG Noggin
got it so you we did our new strikes

458
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:43,380
got it so you we did our new strikes
 

459
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,910

understand
so the same thing if we're we're here

472
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
so the same thing if we're we're here
 

473
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,710
so the same thing if we're we're here
and we we all know

474
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:09,720
and we we all know
 

475
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,650
and we we all know
this takedown right

476
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:12,660
this takedown right
 

477
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,410
this takedown right
you get it so this is fixated motion

478
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,420
you get it so this is fixated motion
 

479
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,530
you get it so this is fixated motion
though you

480
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,540
though you
 

481
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,410
though you
understand uh you kind of duplicate the

482
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:21,420
understand uh you kind of duplicate the
 

483
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,829
understand uh you kind of duplicate the
same thing by boom pop you see this is

484
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:24,839
same thing by boom pop you see this is
 

485
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,110
same thing by boom pop you see this is
ballistic

486
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,120
ballistic
 

487
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,110
ballistic
and you did the same

488
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120

 

489
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,050

that is much faster you get it but

490
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,060
that is much faster you get it but
 

491
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,290
that is much faster you get it but
sometimes you need fixated motion okay

492
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,300
sometimes you need fixated motion okay
 

493
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,810
sometimes you need fixated motion okay
so if you have

494
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:41,820
so if you have
 

495
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,490
so if you have
a guy's he's going move you can do these

496
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:46,500
a guy's he's going move you can do these
 

497
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,009
a guy's he's going move you can do these
these kind of dislods do you understand

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,180
going this way I can do that it's doable
 

507
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,769
going this way I can do that it's doable
but it's gonna be much faster

508
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:03,779
but it's gonna be much faster
 

509
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,650
