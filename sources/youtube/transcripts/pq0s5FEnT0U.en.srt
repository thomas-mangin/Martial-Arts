1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,909

so we'll start uh

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
so we'll start uh
 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,590
so we'll start uh
more embryonic again okay

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
more embryonic again okay
 

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,990
more embryonic again okay
so uh we're going to

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
so uh we're going to
 

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,190
so uh we're going to
start in yeah

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
start in yeah
 

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,470
start in yeah
okay

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480

 

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,990

and then as i push forward you will take

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
and then as i push forward you will take
 

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,349
and then as i push forward you will take
a step back

14
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
a step back
 

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:47,590
a step back
and you'll come to uh

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600

 

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,950

and as we do this here you want to uh

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
and as we do this here you want to uh
 

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,750
and as we do this here you want to uh
not give the open okay so you lifted

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
not give the open okay so you lifted
 

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,389
not give the open okay so you lifted
before i

22
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
before i
 

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,029
before i
did at that time so there's going to be

24
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
did at that time so there's going to be
 

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,229
did at that time so there's going to be
an ik adhesion

26
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
an ik adhesion
 

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,790
an ik adhesion
here at the sword contact okay and

28
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
here at the sword contact okay and
 

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,950
here at the sword contact okay and
that's what pushes you back

30
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
that's what pushes you back
 

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,950
that's what pushes you back
up so the first absorption is always

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
up so the first absorption is always
 

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,789
up so the first absorption is always
with the weight shift

34
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799

 

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:24,830

feel the vibration in the weapon

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,590

better

38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600

 

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,310

initiative at this point okay so you

40
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
initiative at this point okay so you
 

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,830
initiative at this point okay so you
have to match

42
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
have to match
 

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,510
have to match
me

44
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520

 

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,830

and then i do something tricky on my

46
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
and then i do something tricky on my
 

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,469
and then i do something tricky on my
side that he does not do

48
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
side that he does not do
 

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,830
side that he does not do
okay i'm going to take my back foot

50
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
okay i'm going to take my back foot
 

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,990
okay i'm going to take my back foot
and secretly move it in

52
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
and secretly move it in
 

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,109
and secretly move it in
so i'll just demonstrate that so it

54
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
so i'll just demonstrate that so it
 

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,590
so i'll just demonstrate that so it
looks like i'm stepping

56
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
looks like i'm stepping
 

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,030
looks like i'm stepping
one step forward but i'm i'm actually

58
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
one step forward but i'm i'm actually
 

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,230
one step forward but i'm i'm actually
going to

60
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
going to
 

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,070
going to
move the foot in so i'll demonstrate

62
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
move the foot in so i'll demonstrate
 

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,670
move the foot in so i'll demonstrate
that again

64
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
that again
 

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,750
that again
i'm going not here and keeping

66
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
i'm going not here and keeping
 

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,229
i'm going not here and keeping
this width i'm hiding that i change the

68
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
this width i'm hiding that i change the
 

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,510
this width i'm hiding that i change the
depth of my

70
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
depth of my
 

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,110
depth of my
stack so in and from here there's no

72
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
stack so in and from here there's no
 

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,790
stack so in and from here there's no
there's no other movement but the foot

74
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
there's no other movement but the foot
 

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:42,470
there's no other movement but the foot
will come in

76
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480

 

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,630

you guys stay with me don't don't chase

78
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
you guys stay with me don't don't chase
 

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:03:00,550
you guys stay with me don't don't chase
the form chase the relationship

80
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560

 

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,070

so you see from your point of view you

82
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
so you see from your point of view you
 

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,070
so you see from your point of view you
can't see i brought that footage

84
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
can't see i brought that footage
 

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,670
can't see i brought that footage
right all right okay a little

86
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
right all right okay a little
 

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,630
right all right okay a little
more detail so uh again there's not too

88
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
more detail so uh again there's not too
 

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,589
more detail so uh again there's not too
hard so the

90
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
hard so the
 

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,910
hard so the
all the way shifting you do in a count

92
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
all the way shifting you do in a count
 

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,509
all the way shifting you do in a count
stability you do here

94
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
stability you do here
 

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,910
stability you do here
so i don't want to move with my line of

96
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
so i don't want to move with my line of
 

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,070
so i don't want to move with my line of
gravity between my two legs

98
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
gravity between my two legs
 

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,830
gravity between my two legs
i'm never going like this so my weight

100
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
i'm never going like this so my weight
 

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,110
i'm never going like this so my weight
is going to shift i create a yawn phase

102
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
is going to shift i create a yawn phase
 

103
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,910
is going to shift i create a yawn phase
on the front leg then this leg has no

104
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
on the front leg then this leg has no
 

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,630
on the front leg then this leg has no
weight

106
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
weight
 

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,470
weight
and that's when it moves and then i'm

108
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
and that's when it moves and then i'm
 

109
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,229
and that's when it moves and then i'm
going to create the other young face

110
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
going to create the other young face
 

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,149
going to create the other young face
here and that's what allows that leg to

112
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
here and that's what allows that leg to
 

113
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,550
here and that's what allows that leg to
slip

114
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
slip
 

115
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,550
slip
in without it being detectable

116
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
in without it being detectable
 

117
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,390
in without it being detectable
in my body movement secondly

118
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
in my body movement secondly
 

119
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,789
in my body movement secondly
i'm trying to bait him i'm baiting him

120
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
i'm trying to bait him i'm baiting him
 

121
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,070
i'm trying to bait him i'm baiting him
with the risk

122
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
with the risk
 

123
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,229
with the risk
it's no different than any other baiting

124
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
it's no different than any other baiting
 

125
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,430
it's no different than any other baiting
strategy so

126
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
strategy so
 

127
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,350
strategy so
for example in the dilemmas or the

128
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
for example in the dilemmas or the
 

129
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,670
for example in the dilemmas or the
setups you use in network

130
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
setups you use in network
 

131
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,509
setups you use in network
uh you give the guy like a famed

132
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
uh you give the guy like a famed
 

133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,670
uh you give the guy like a famed
guard past potential and you put him in

134
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
guard past potential and you put him in
 

135
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,670
guard past potential and you put him in
the triangle this kind of stuff

136
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
the triangle this kind of stuff
 

137
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,429
the triangle this kind of stuff
so you want to come up in a way

138
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
so you want to come up in a way
 

139
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,869
so you want to come up in a way
that it's enticing for him to feel that

140
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
that it's enticing for him to feel that
 

141
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,789
that it's enticing for him to feel that
the wrist is vulnerable

142
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
the wrist is vulnerable
 

143
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,910
the wrist is vulnerable
okay and that's not gonna happen

144
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
okay and that's not gonna happen
 

145
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,310
okay and that's not gonna happen
if the wrist is not the closest thing to

146
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
if the wrist is not the closest thing to
 

147
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,430
if the wrist is not the closest thing to
him

148
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
him
 

149
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,790
him
so if i start going like this it's

150
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
so if i start going like this it's
 

151
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,909
so if i start going like this it's
not my foot is closer okay so

152
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
not my foot is closer okay so
 

153
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,710
not my foot is closer okay so
i have to have this slight angle here

154
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
i have to have this slight angle here
 

155
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,430
i have to have this slight angle here
without having my needle pass

156
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
without having my needle pass
 

157
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,550
without having my needle pass
into a degenerated yarn face so that's

158
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
into a degenerated yarn face so that's
 

159
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,510
into a degenerated yarn face so that's
where i get

160
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
where i get
 

161
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,990
where i get
okay so as i move just my part

162
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
okay so as i move just my part
 

163
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,230
okay so as i move just my part
young face shift raise the sword

164
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
young face shift raise the sword
 

165
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,670
young face shift raise the sword
boom here thirdly

166
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
boom here thirdly
 

167
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,710
boom here thirdly
don't give a yin space opening

168
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
don't give a yin space opening
 

169
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,310
don't give a yin space opening
so you don't lift the sword like that

170
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
so you don't lift the sword like that
 

171
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,350
so you don't lift the sword like that

175
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,710

no he he would have took that bait

176
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
no he he would have took that bait
 

177
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,670
no he he would have took that bait
already when

178
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
already when
 

179
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,189
already when
when the sword came in so he would feel

180
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
when the sword came in so he would feel
 

181
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,629
when the sword came in so he would feel
that disconnect

182
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639

 

183
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,150

out here so you see i slightly turn

186
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
out here so you see i slightly turn
 

187
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,830
out here so you see i slightly turn
reversing rolls

188
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
reversing rolls
 

189
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,029
reversing rolls
so same thing goes as he starts to move

190
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
so same thing goes as he starts to move
 

191
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,390
so same thing goes as he starts to move
i shift my weight go back

192
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
i shift my weight go back
 

193
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
i shift my weight go back
so i don't want to have mid-foot weight

194
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
so i don't want to have mid-foot weight
 

195
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,310
so i don't want to have mid-foot weight
he goes and i'm going like this

196
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
he goes and i'm going like this
 

197
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,510
he goes and i'm going like this
he moves i move he goes

198
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
he moves i move he goes
 

199
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,550
he moves i move he goes
oh his tip comes up

200
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
oh his tip comes up
 

201
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,749
oh his tip comes up
so you went young on your thrust so

202
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
so you went young on your thrust so
 

203
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,870
so you went young on your thrust so
just lift your tip up when you when you

204
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
just lift your tip up when you when you
 

205
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,510
just lift your tip up when you when you
go

206
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
go
 

207
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,590
go
lift your tip up that's it

208
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600

 

209
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,469

then just as you're in your network the

210
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
then just as you're in your network the
 

211
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,230
then just as you're in your network the
guy has the mouth

212
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
guy has the mouth
 

213
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,870
guy has the mouth
or side control there's no reason to

214
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
or side control there's no reason to
 

215
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,670
or side control there's no reason to
give him

216
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
give him
 

217
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,110
give him
a perpendicular or or spine parallel in

218
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
a perpendicular or or spine parallel in
 

219
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,670
a perpendicular or or spine parallel in
in the mouth there's no reason to keep

220
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
in the mouth there's no reason to keep
 

221
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,070
in the mouth there's no reason to keep
the initial angle

222
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
the initial angle
 

223
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,550
the initial angle
so as he goes in other words i don't

224
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
so as he goes in other words i don't
 

225
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,309
so as he goes in other words i don't
want him to

226
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
want him to
 

227
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,510
want him to
move closer as i'm just here straight in

228
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
move closer as i'm just here straight in
 

229
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,350
move closer as i'm just here straight in
the same angle

230
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360

 

231
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,950

or as he moves you'll see that he turns

232
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
or as he moves you'll see that he turns
 

233
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,189
or as he moves you'll see that he turns
so i have to turn

234
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
so i have to turn
 

235
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,070
so i have to turn
the fight rotates and this puts me off

236
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
the fight rotates and this puts me off
 

237
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,790
the fight rotates and this puts me off
the line

238
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800

 

239
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,590

he goes don't step straight back

240
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
he goes don't step straight back
 

241
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,950
he goes don't step straight back
now you're over here and he's starting

242
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
now you're over here and he's starting
 

243
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:58,390
now you're over here and he's starting
to flank you

244
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400

 

245
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:16,550

then just embryonic starting here

246
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560

 

247
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,909

uh for proper cocu

248
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
uh for proper cocu

internal aspects always mid-foot vector

250
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
internal aspects always mid-foot vector
 

251
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,469
internal aspects always mid-foot vector
and not the flat on your head if i if

252
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
and not the flat on your head if i if
 

253
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,670
and not the flat on your head if i if
you pay attention

254
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
you pay attention
 

255
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,510
you pay attention
if i just stand here with the flat of my

256
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
if i just stand here with the flat of my
 

257
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,189
if i just stand here with the flat of my
head eventually i'm going back

258
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
head eventually i'm going back
 

259
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,430
head eventually i'm going back
because i'm not midfield vector i'm heel

260
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
because i'm not midfield vector i'm heel
 

261
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,670
because i'm not midfield vector i'm heel
weighted

262
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
weighted
 

263
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,670
weighted
so i have to put the crown of my head as

264
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
so i have to put the crown of my head as
 

265
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,790
so i have to put the crown of my head as
the top part

266
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800

 

267
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,390

not here then when i go into the

268
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
not here then when i go into the
 

269
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,309
not here then when i go into the
fake opening i actually will exaggerate

270
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
fake opening i actually will exaggerate
 

271
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,110
fake opening i actually will exaggerate
this with my gaze okay so we're going in

272
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
this with my gaze okay so we're going in
 

273
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,110
this with my gaze okay so we're going in
boom and i'm going to look down here

274
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
boom and i'm going to look down here
 

275
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,270
boom and i'm going to look down here
not here there's no opening if i'm

276
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
not here there's no opening if i'm
 

277
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,189
not here there's no opening if i'm
sitting here eyeballing him

278
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
sitting here eyeballing him
 

279
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,670
sitting here eyeballing him
so i'm over here looking this way

280
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680

 

281
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,830

if we switch roles

282
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840

 

283
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,029

perform as he goes my mets head

284
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
perform as he goes my mets head
 

285
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,029
perform as he goes my mets head
is at the upper chest not looking at his

286
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
is at the upper chest not looking at his
 

287
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,469
is at the upper chest not looking at his
sword

00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
not here
 

293
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,230
not here
okay so i will use my mid scan

294
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
okay so i will use my mid scan
 

295
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,589
okay so i will use my mid scan
to add to the fame

296
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599

 

297
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,630

he uses his med scanner

298
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
he uses his med scanner
 

299
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:58,630
he uses his med scanner
at my upper thoracic cavity

300
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640

 

301
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,070

okay staying embryonic

302
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
okay staying embryonic
 

303
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,710
okay staying embryonic
we're doing all that

304
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720

 

305
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,310

and he's gonna come in and put it

306
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
and he's gonna come in and put it
 

307
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,230
and he's gonna come in and put it
okay and sew it in the right place

308
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
okay and sew it in the right place
 

309
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,470
okay and sew it in the right place
and be at like an inch off okay

310
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
and be at like an inch off okay
 

311
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,030
and be at like an inch off okay
then embryonically i'm gonna do the cut

312
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
then embryonically i'm gonna do the cut
 

313
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,110
then embryonically i'm gonna do the cut
so this is not the technique but this is

314
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
so this is not the technique but this is
 

315
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,350
so this is not the technique but this is
the micro drilling of the technique

316
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
the micro drilling of the technique
 

317
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,150
the micro drilling of the technique
so i'm going to shift my weight rotate

318
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
so i'm going to shift my weight rotate
 

319
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,110
so i'm going to shift my weight rotate
my hips

320
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
my hips
 

321
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,630
my hips
move off the line

322
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640

 

323
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,750

with the ushito tank so he's there

324
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
with the ushito tank so he's there
 

325
00:09:35,760 --> 00:10:02,069
with the ushito tank so he's there
boom and i do the draw

326
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079

 

327
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,230

we'll do it twice from there just to get

328
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
we'll do it twice from there just to get
 

329
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,990
we'll do it twice from there just to get
the reps in

330
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000

 

331
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:31,030

then we'll start over

332
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040

 

333
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,389

let's go back to that one move so

334
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
let's go back to that one move so
 

335
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,509
let's go back to that one move so
as i stepped in

336
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
as i stepped in
 

337
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,790
as i stepped in
this it looks at the upper part it looks

338
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
this it looks at the upper part it looks
 

339
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,350
this it looks at the upper part it looks
like your normal hidey miyagi

340
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
like your normal hidey miyagi
 

341
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,269
like your normal hidey miyagi
torso but it's not because my legs not

342
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279

so that when i drive i get the
 

371
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,430
so that when i drive i get the
angle deviation in the rotation of the

372
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
angle deviation in the rotation of the
 

373
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,310
angle deviation in the rotation of the
weight shift

374
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
weight shift
 

375
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,269
weight shift
okay secondly

376

it's impossible to put weight here
 

407
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,949
it's impossible to put weight here
so you see where the tip is that's where

408
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
so you see where the tip is that's where

so you see where the tip is that's where
my body lines up here

410
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
my body lines up here
 

411
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,629
my body lines up here
start over here my weight's actually

412
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639

413
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,790
start over here my weight's actually
over here i'm tweaking the hell out of

414

over here i'm tweaking the hell out of
 

415
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,430
over here i'm tweaking the hell out of
my knee

416
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
my knee
 

417
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:19,670

419
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,389

this is why this foot is very important

420
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
this is why this foot is very important
 

421
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,230
this is why this foot is very important
