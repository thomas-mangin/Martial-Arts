hi everyone i hope you're all well i
thought i'd make this video to share
some footage i filmed while i was
traveling around the isle of skye during
this summer in 2021
we visited so many amazing locations but
i'll only be focusing on my top three
favorite places
if you've got any questions about where
i went feel free to ask in the comments
below
with that being said i hope you enjoyed
the video
