00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,350

you can see it's coming from

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
you can see it's coming from
 

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,269
you can see it's coming from
this way in

4
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
this way in
 

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,910
this way in
it has to because my elbow is going to

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
it has to because my elbow is going to
 

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,750
it has to because my elbow is going to
be

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
be
 

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,029
be
at the yin line and my hands going to be

10
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
at the yin line and my hands going to be
 

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,670
at the yin line and my hands going to be
at the neutral line my hand's not out

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
at the neutral line my hand's not out
 

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,870
at the neutral line my hand's not out
yet

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
yet
 

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,389
yet
so as he squares his hips on the step

16
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
so as he squares his hips on the step
 

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,430
so as he squares his hips on the step
through

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
through
 

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,549
through
this shoulder has to come forward

20
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
this shoulder has to come forward
 

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,270
this shoulder has to come forward
and of course it's not only moving this

22
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
and of course it's not only moving this
 

23
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,150
and of course it's not only moving this
way

24
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
way
 

25
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,069
way
but it's moving that way

26
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
but it's moving that way
 

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,389
but it's moving that way
and this is another reason why you don't

28
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
and this is another reason why you don't
 

29
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,270
and this is another reason why you don't
do tai no hanko like that

30
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280

 

31
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,869

so this hand is going forward

32
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
so this hand is going forward
 

33
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,150
so this hand is going forward
and in therefore

34
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
and in therefore
 

35
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,950
and in therefore
any movement that is not allowing it to

36
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
any movement that is not allowing it to
 

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,990
any movement that is not allowing it to
go forward and

38
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
go forward and
 

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,830
go forward and
in is a clash on that hand

40
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
in is a clash on that hand
 

41
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,590
in is a clash on that hand
also his fingers

42
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
also his fingers
 

43
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,789
also his fingers
are closing and going back on the other

44
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
are closing and going back on the other
 

45
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,190
are closing and going back on the other
way

46
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
way
 

47
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,630
way
of his grip so anything that is going

48
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
of his grip so anything that is going
 

49
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,190
of his grip so anything that is going
against the closing of those fingers

50
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
against the closing of those fingers
 

51
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,030
against the closing of those fingers
is also a clash

52
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040

 

53
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:38,069

hence we go like this

54
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079

 

55
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,310

this is going against the fingers

56
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320

 

57
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,590

i have to get his grip

58
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
i have to get his grip
 

59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,870
i have to get his grip
and turn it and allow his energy to keep

60
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
and turn it and allow his energy to keep
 

61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,230
and turn it and allow his energy to keep
going

62
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
going
 

63
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,590
going
as i rotate the cross

64
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
as i rotate the cross
 

65
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,910
as i rotate the cross
he presented the cross and i turned the

66
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
he presented the cross and i turned the
 

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,030
he presented the cross and i turned the
cross

68
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
cross
 

69
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,910
cross
so what was the cross and he had a north

70
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
so what was the cross and he had a north
 

71
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,709
so what was the cross and he had a north
south east

72
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
south east
 

73
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,069
south east
west to his movement and i just rotate

74
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
west to his movement and i just rotate
 

75
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,069
west to his movement and i just rotate
the cross

76
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
the cross
 

77
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,029
the cross
and then i rotate the cross then

78
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
and then i rotate the cross then
 

79
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,070
and then i rotate the cross then
everything gets

80
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
everything gets
 

81
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,630
everything gets
reorganized yin becomes young young

82
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
reorganized yin becomes young young
 

83
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,190
reorganized yin becomes young young
becomes

84
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
becomes
 

85
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:35,589
becomes
in everything turn

86
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599

 

87
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,390

okay let's try it okay so this concept

88
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
okay let's try it okay so this concept
 

89
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,630
okay let's try it okay so this concept
of

90
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
of
 

91
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,190
of
juji we use over and over but we use

92
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
juji we use over and over but we use
 

93
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,509
juji we use over and over but we use
lots of concepts so we have to use judy

94
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
lots of concepts so we have to use judy
 

95
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,509
lots of concepts so we have to use judy
in a particular way and

96
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
in a particular way and
 

97
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,110
in a particular way and
we have an inward spiral and we have an

98
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
we have an inward spiral and we have an
 

99
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,229
we have an inward spiral and we have an
outward spiral and they

100
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
outward spiral and they
 

101
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,350
outward spiral and they
too have a particular way what is that

102
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
too have a particular way what is that
 

103
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,470
too have a particular way what is that
way

104
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
way

i cannot activate the deltoids i have to
deactivate the deltoids the deltoid

able to go in

124
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
able to go in
 

125
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,589
able to go in
but i cannot use my deltoid to do that

126
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
but i cannot use my deltoid to do that
 

127
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,990
but i cannot use my deltoid to do that
it's very very weak it's inferior

128
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000

 

129
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,390

hence these spirals okay so we'll go

130
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
hence these spirals okay so we'll go
 

131
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,670
hence these spirals okay so we'll go
back to this drill

132
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
back to this drill
 

133
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,229
back to this drill
the first drill here please and we have

134
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
the first drill here please and we have
 

135
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,190
the first drill here please and we have
this drill so the inward turning spiral

136
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
this drill so the inward turning spiral
 

137
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,149
this drill so the inward turning spiral
was practiced in eco and then the hour

138
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
was practiced in eco and then the hour
 

139
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,149
was practiced in eco and then the hour
turning spirals and

140
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
turning spirals and
 

141
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,470
turning spirals and
tokyo ball but it's in every technique

142
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
tokyo ball but it's in every technique
 

143
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,470
tokyo ball but it's in every technique
you just repeat that over and over

144
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
you just repeat that over and over
 

145
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,830
you just repeat that over and over
okay so when i do the first

146
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
okay so when i do the first
 

147
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,149
okay so when i do the first
turning of the juju you can see that it

148
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
turning of the juju you can see that it
 

149
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,589
turning of the juju you can see that it
is the outward

150
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
is the outward
 

151
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,390
is the outward
it's part of the outward turning spiral

152
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
it's part of the outward turning spiral
 

153
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,670
it's part of the outward turning spiral
i cannot do that

154
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
i cannot do that
 

155
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,949
i cannot do that
in a way where i'm

156
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959

 

157
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,110

using my deltoid the inner deltoid here

158
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
using my deltoid the inner deltoid here
 

159
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,030
using my deltoid the inner deltoid here
so it has to follow the pattern

160
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
so it has to follow the pattern
 

161
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,550
so it has to follow the pattern
you should be able to find the cocky

162
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
you should be able to find the cocky
 

163
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:10,949
you should be able to find the cocky

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
that technique
 

177
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,110
that technique
and you if you're honest you're using

178
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
and you if you're honest you're using
 

179
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,710
and you if you're honest you're using
your deltoid to do

180
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
your deltoid to do
 

181
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,629
your deltoid to do
the technique so instead it's going to

182
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
the technique so instead it's going to
 

183
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,189
the technique so instead it's going to
be right

184
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199

 

185
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,230

the gigi turns and

186
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240

 

187
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,270

turn

188
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280

 

189
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590

again i don't prioritize knocking them

190
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
again i don't prioritize knocking them
 

191
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,310
again i don't prioritize knocking them
down

192
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
down
 

193
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,110
down
and really go like that because again

194
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
and really go like that because again
 

195
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,270
and really go like that because again
that's going to be outer deltoid

196
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
that's going to be outer deltoid
 

197
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,270
that's going to be outer deltoid
so it's a green of the shoal

198
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280

 

199
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,590

it using

200
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600

 

201
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,070

the deltoid freeing harmonizing

202
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
the deltoid freeing harmonizing
 

203
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,830
the deltoid freeing harmonizing
then not using the deltoid the spiral

204
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
then not using the deltoid the spiral
 

205
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,629
then not using the deltoid the spiral
instead

206
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:19,639

 

207
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,230

harmonizing no deltoid

208
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
harmonizing no deltoid
 

209
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,990
harmonizing no deltoid
don't come back keep the spiral going

210
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000

 

211
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,510

for the outward turning spiral

212
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520

 

213
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,590

okay let's see the inward and the

214
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
okay let's see the inward and the
 

215
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,990
okay let's see the inward and the
outward turning spirals do not

216
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
outward turning spirals do not
 

217
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,150
outward turning spirals do not
free us from having to use the deltoid

218
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
free us from having to use the deltoid
 

219
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,710
free us from having to use the deltoid
by some sort of talismanic power

220
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
by some sort of talismanic power
 

221
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,950
by some sort of talismanic power
what happens is the thing that i want to

222
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
what happens is the thing that i want to
 

223
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,029
what happens is the thing that i want to
move from into out or from out to in

224
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
move from into out or from out to in
 

225
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,270
move from into out or from out to in
is brought forward into its cycle of

226
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
is brought forward into its cycle of
 

227
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,990
is brought forward into its cycle of
action

228
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
action
 

229
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,230
action
and is now actually going in the other

230
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
and is now actually going in the other
 

231
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,270
and is now actually going in the other
direction that i

232
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
direction that i
 

233
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,070
direction that i
that i wanted to go so when he goes

234
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
that i wanted to go so when he goes
 

235
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,590
that i wanted to go so when he goes
around here i

236
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
around here i
 

237
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,870
around here i
do the juji harmonization to go back

238
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
do the juji harmonization to go back
 

239
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,790
do the juji harmonization to go back
into him now is going to be

240
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
into him now is going to be
 

241
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,390
into him now is going to be
my deltoid no matter what okay but by

242
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
my deltoid no matter what okay but by
 

243
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,110
my deltoid no matter what okay but by
continuing the cycle do you see he's

244
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
continuing the cycle do you see he's
 

245
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,150
continuing the cycle do you see he's
coming forward

246
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
coming forward
 

247
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,189
coming forward
into it and which way is he falling he's

248
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
into it and which way is he falling he's
 

249
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,350
into it and which way is he falling he's
falling that way already

250
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
falling that way already
 

251
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,150
falling that way already
so you want to in these drills you want

252
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
so you want to in these drills you want
 

253
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,110
so you want to in these drills you want
to complete

254
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
to complete
 

255
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,590
to complete
the spiral so

256
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600

 

257
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:40,550

not um

258
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560

 

259
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,230

here not back forward whoa

260
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
here not back forward whoa
 

261
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,830
here not back forward whoa
then he's going backwards now the other

262
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
then he's going backwards now the other
 

263
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,790
then he's going backwards now the other
way

264
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800

 

265
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,430

so i'll do it here this is now going

266
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
so i'll do it here this is now going
 

267
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,830
so i'll do it here this is now going
back

268
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
back
 

269
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,749
back
some magic thing you think is gonna

270
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
some magic thing you think is gonna
 

271
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,790
some magic thing you think is gonna
happen

272
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800

 

273
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,629

here juji reconciliation

274
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
here juji reconciliation
 

275
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,110
here juji reconciliation
then i'm going to do my spiral knot back

276
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
then i'm going to do my spiral knot back
 

277
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,029
then i'm going to do my spiral knot back
here

278
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:06,039
here
 

279
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,510
here
forward

280
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520

 

281
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,510

some of you understand that the deltoid

282
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
some of you understand that the deltoid
 

283
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
some of you understand that the deltoid
is using but you're finding another

284
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
is using but you're finding another
 

285
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,589
is using but you're finding another
engine is you're going here and you're

286
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
engine is you're going here and you're
 

287
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,589
engine is you're going here and you're
going around him

288
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
going around him
 

289
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,309
going around him
you're trying to get energy by going

290
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
you're trying to get energy by going
 

291
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,589
you're trying to get energy by going
around him

292
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
around him
 

293
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,189
around him
that makes him the center of the

294
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
that makes him the center of the
 

295
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,950
that makes him the center of the
technique you want to be the center of

296
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
technique you want to be the center of
 

297
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,830
technique you want to be the center of
the technique so he goes around

298
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

299
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,860

you

300
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:31,870

 

301
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,550

[Music]

302
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560

 

303
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,670

if you become infatuated with shoving

304
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
if you become infatuated with shoving
 

305
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,710
if you become infatuated with shoving
them back

306
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
them back
 

307
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,469
them back
you'll never get it you should need to

308
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
you'll never get it you should need to
 

309
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,589
you'll never get it you should need to
be infatuated with bringing him forward

310
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
be infatuated with bringing him forward
 

311
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,869
be infatuated with bringing him forward
and getting his light and the float

312
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
and getting his light and the float
 

313
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,790
and getting his light and the float
he won't float if he doesn't come

314
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
he won't float if he doesn't come
 

315
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,230
he won't float if he doesn't come
forward you actually pin

316
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
forward you actually pin
 

317
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,990
forward you actually pin
him so become infatuated with

the throw happens
even with this height advantage he could

even with this height advantage he could
 

345
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,070
even with this height advantage he could
stop it

346
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
stop it
 

347
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,269
stop it
a joke in that amount of time he can

348
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,509
a joke in that amount of time he can
move he can draw a weapon he can let go

00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
move he can draw a weapon he can let go
 

351
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,509
move he can draw a weapon he can let go
he can change everything

352
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519

 

353
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,430

that's not where the throw happens that

354
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
that's not where the throw happens that
 

355
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,590
that's not where the throw happens that
is not where the ark is

356
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
is not where the ark is
 

357
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,030

physically energetically so that's why i
 

367
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,430
physically energetically so that's why i
turned this to go anywhere else but

368
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
turned this to go anywhere else but
 

369
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,350
turned this to go anywhere else but

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,190
that is in a technique like coquiho
is what we're doing in jordan

398
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200

 

399
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,310

i do this so let's pay attention now

400
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
i do this so let's pay attention now
 

401
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,350
i do this so let's pay attention now
to just that portion

402
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
to just that portion
 

403
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,110
to just that portion
my elbow i'm going to divide my body

404
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
my elbow i'm going to divide my body
 

405
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,829
my elbow i'm going to divide my body
i have a line at my shoulder a line

406
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
i have a line at my shoulder a line
 

407
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,590
i have a line at my shoulder a line
halfway to my center line

408
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
halfway to my center line
 

409
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,990
halfway to my center line
my center line halfway to my shoulder

410
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
my center line halfway to my shoulder
 

411
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,590
my center line halfway to my shoulder
and shoulder

412
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
and shoulder
 

413
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,550
and shoulder
it is very important this is telling me

414
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
it is very important this is telling me
 

415
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,069
it is very important this is telling me
where my hands can go

416
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
where my hands can go
 

417
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,230
where my hands can go
and can't go so they do those spirals

418
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
and can't go so they do those spirals
 

419
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,190
and can't go so they do those spirals
so i keep energy reconciled and i don't

420
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
so i keep energy reconciled and i don't
 

421
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,430
so i keep energy reconciled and i don't
use my aerodeltoid and do a young

422
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
use my aerodeltoid and do a young
 

423
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,550
use my aerodeltoid and do a young
young conflict so

424
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
young conflict so
 

425
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,389
young conflict so
my i don't ever have my hand

426
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
my i don't ever have my hand
 

427
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,630
my i don't ever have my hand
my elbow and my shoulder in the same

428
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
my elbow and my shoulder in the same
 

429
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,470
my elbow and my shoulder in the same
line it is already wrong

430
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
line it is already wrong
 

431
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,230
line it is already wrong
you can already tell you're using your

432
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
you can already tell you're using your
 

433
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,630
you can already tell you're using your
deltoid when you do when he does this

434
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
deltoid when you do when he does this
 

435
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,790
deltoid when you do when he does this
he's pushing on me and i can feel it in

436
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
he's pushing on me and i can feel it in
 

437
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,990
he's pushing on me and i can feel it in
my deltoid

438
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000

 

439
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,790

so my hand will be on my center my elbow

440
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
so my hand will be on my center my elbow
 

441
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,509
so my hand will be on my center my elbow
will be

442
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
will be
 

443
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,710
will be
on that halfway line

444
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720

 

445
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,430

and when i do the spiral they do the

446
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
and when i do the spiral they do the
 

447
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,990
and when i do the spiral they do the
juji

448
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
juji
 

449
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,110
juji
a little slower the elbow is going to

450
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
a little slower the elbow is going to
 

451
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,590
a little slower the elbow is going to
move

452
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
move
 

453
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,829
move
and trade places and come to the center

454
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
and trade places and come to the center
 

455
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,190
and trade places and come to the center
line

456
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200

 

457
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,670

for the spiral to continue in the

458
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
for the spiral to continue in the
 

459
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,630
for the spiral to continue in the
technique

460
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
technique
 

461
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,990
technique
it's going to go all the way you see

462
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
it's going to go all the way you see
 

463
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,790
it's going to go all the way you see
coming all the way to the next halfway

464
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
coming all the way to the next halfway
 

465
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,190
coming all the way to the next halfway
and the hand goes to the shoulder line

466
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
and the hand goes to the shoulder line
 

467
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,670
and the hand goes to the shoulder line
that's where you get that flow

468
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680

 

469
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,949

if you watch it now from that pattern

470
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
if you watch it now from that pattern
 

471
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,990
if you watch it now from that pattern
you don't get there you keep your elbow

472
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
you don't get there you keep your elbow
 

473
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,910
you don't get there you keep your elbow
at the center line you don't go to the

474
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
at the center line you don't go to the
 

475
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,550
at the center line you don't go to the
halfway

476
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
halfway
 

477
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,190
halfway
your hand is at the halfway you see that

478
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
your hand is at the halfway you see that
 

479
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,069
your hand is at the halfway you see that
this is where you shove him

480
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
this is where you shove him
 

481
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,230
this is where you shove him
you have to fulfill the pattern whoa

482
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
you have to fulfill the pattern whoa
 

483
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,750
you have to fulfill the pattern whoa
whoa that's the float right there

484
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760

 

485
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,710

so for joedon's pistol bucky

486
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
so for joedon's pistol bucky
 

487
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,629
so for joedon's pistol bucky
starts here elbow comes to the center

we won't go past that elbow

492
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
we won't go past that elbow
 

493
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,110
we won't go past that elbow
comes to the center line right here

494
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120

 

495
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,190

go back to the initial drill with the

496
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
go back to the initial drill with the
 

497
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,750
go back to the initial drill with the
juji and elbow comes to my center line

498
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760

 

499
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,790

don't change this

500
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
don't change this
 

501
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,069
don't change this
it's the same kata dirty angle

502
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079

 

503
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,829

elbow central

507
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,030

this angle too does not change don't

508
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
this angle too does not change don't
 

509
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,069
this angle too does not change don't
bring your elbow in

510
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
bring your elbow in
 

511
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,269
bring your elbow in
next to your body

512
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279

 

513
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:09,829

the gg has to happen in that geometry

514
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839

 

515
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,110

and you must see the outward spiral you

516
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
and you must see the outward spiral you
 

517
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,829
and you must see the outward spiral you
must see

518
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
must see
 

519
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,069
must see
oh if i kept that elbow going i would

520
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
oh if i kept that elbow going i would
 

521
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,750
oh if i kept that elbow going i would
get the outer spiral

522
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
get the outer spiral
 

523
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,110
get the outer spiral
okay go back to drill away

524
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
okay go back to drill away
 

525
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,870
okay go back to drill away
when this line goes from

526
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
when this line goes from
 

527
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,910
when this line goes from
the yin position to the transition

528
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
the yin position to the transition
 

529
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,550
the yin position to the transition
position

530
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
position
 

531
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,670
position
at the elbow then that is where this

532
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
at the elbow then that is where this
 

533
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,150
at the elbow then that is where this
other

534
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
other
 

535
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,110
other
elbow will come in

536
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120

 

537
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,150

so it was again

538
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
so it was again
 

539
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,030
so it was again
at the inline it'll meet in the center

540
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
at the inline it'll meet in the center
 

541
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,949
at the inline it'll meet in the center
line

542
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959

 

543
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,230

and it will begin

544
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240

 

545
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,629

the outward spiral

546
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639

 

547
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,790

outward spiral and go into

548
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
outward spiral and go into
 

549
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,350
outward spiral and go into
the inward spiral which i'll show you

550
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
the inward spiral which i'll show you
 

551
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,430
the inward spiral which i'll show you
what

552
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
what
 

553
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,870
what
so again the inward spiral wasn't here

554
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880

 

555
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,990

i'm going to use that to actually be

556
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
i'm going to use that to actually be
 

557
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,910
i'm going to use that to actually be
outward okay so i'm going around like

558
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
outward okay so i'm going around like
 

559
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,030
outward okay so i'm going around like
this

560
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
this
 

561
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,189
this
and this hand is going to go like this

562
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
and this hand is going to go like this
 

563
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,829
and this hand is going to go like this
but how we're moving it moves him that

564
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

565
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,550

way

566
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
way
 

567
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:39,509
way
reconcile this way

568
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519

 

569
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,430

here

570
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440

 

571
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,470

because to do this

572
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
because to do this
 

573
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,949
because to do this
is my outer deltoid

574
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959

 

575
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,189

so elbow full bone

576
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199

 

577
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,310

and to that i have my movement

578
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320

 

579
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,470

so the fight has rotated don't go here

580
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
so the fight has rotated don't go here
 

581
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,189
so the fight has rotated don't go here
out we're not allowed to do that

582
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
out we're not allowed to do that
 

583
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,710
out we're not allowed to do that
use your spiral wall spirals going

584
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
use your spiral wall spirals going
 

585
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,829
use your spiral wall spirals going
in and i move

586
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839

 

587
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,030

boom

588
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
boom
 

589
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,230
boom
so this is freaking you out

590
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
so this is freaking you out
 

591
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,389
so this is freaking you out
if you pay attention imagine someone's

592
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
if you pay attention imagine someone's
 

593
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,350
if you pay attention imagine someone's
grabbing me here

594
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
grabbing me here
 

595
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,350
grabbing me here
and i'm going that way well if you look

596
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
and i'm going that way well if you look
 

597
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,150
and i'm going that way well if you look
at my elbow my elbow went that way

598
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
at my elbow my elbow went that way
 

599
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,710
at my elbow my elbow went that way
so that's what i'm using you see

600
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720

 

601
00:15:44,720 --> 00:16:04,550

i don't go here and then move now

602
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560

 

603
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,910

and i have the same floating

604
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
and i have the same floating
 

605
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,110
and i have the same floating
this is where i float him

606
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120

 

607
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,829

go this way you're gonna pin him

608
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

609
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:31,690

whoa

610
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:31,700

 

611
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,910

[Music]
 

613
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,749

this way whoa

614
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759

 

615
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:51,990

reconcile wreck this up

616
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000

 

617
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,269

and again don't

618
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
and again don't
 

619
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,470
and again don't
lost after this big throwback

620
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
lost after this big throwback
 

621
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,380
lost after this big throwback
lust after whom the float

622
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,390

 

623
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:12,230

[Music]

624
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240

 

625
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,350

using the grid pattern again

626
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
using the grid pattern again
 

627
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,189
using the grid pattern again
line line line line line

628
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
line line line line line
 

629
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,230
line line line line line
so halfway

630
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
so halfway
 

631
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,590
so halfway
center line center line and

632
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
center line center line and
 

633
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,630
center line center line and
it's going to go again

634
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
it's going to go again
 

635
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,510
it's going to go again
to that halfway line

636
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
to that halfway line
 

637
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,350
to that halfway line
so i'm going to show you a couple of

638
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
so i'm going to show you a couple of
 

639
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,669
so i'm going to show you a couple of
things it lets you know if you're doing

640
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
things it lets you know if you're doing
 

641
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,150
things it lets you know if you're doing
it right

642
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
it right
 

643
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,590
it right
outside of the grid so this goes halfway

644
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
outside of the grid so this goes halfway
 

645
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,710
outside of the grid so this goes halfway
line

646
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
line
 

647
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,750
line
center line this picks up at center line

648
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
center line this picks up at center line
 

649
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,150
center line this picks up at center line
and then this because it's doing that

650
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
and then this because it's doing that
 

651
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,950
and then this because it's doing that
gets to

652
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
gets to
 

653
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,310
gets to
halfway lying

654
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
halfway lying
 

655
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,710
halfway lying
aside from the grid if you watch his

656
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
aside from the grid if you watch his
 

657
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,830
aside from the grid if you watch his
body

658
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
body
 

659
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,110
body
he'll come forward and he'll come

660
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
he'll come forward and he'll come
 

661
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,190
he'll come forward and he'll come
forward

662
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200

 

663
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,870

because as i said this elbow is actually

664
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
because as i said this elbow is actually
 

665
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,750
because as i said this elbow is actually
going

666
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
going
 

667
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,350
going
this way but not with my deltoid

668
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
this way but not with my deltoid
 

669
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,830
this way but not with my deltoid
it's coming around

670
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840

 

671
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,110

and just like his head was here his head

672
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
and just like his head was here his head
 

673
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,909
and just like his head was here his head
is going

674
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
is going
 

675
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,230
is going
forward to get the flow

676
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240

 

677
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,830

he's going forward to go that way

678
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840

 

679
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,549

long forward

680
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559

 

681
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,669

well second point

682
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
well second point
 

683
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,669
well second point
what you see instead on your technique

684
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
what you see instead on your technique
 

685
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,510
what you see instead on your technique
is he stays still you go here

686
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
is he stays still you go here
 

687
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,870
is he stays still you go here
and you move around that and then he

688
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
and you move around that and then he
 

689
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,950
and you move around that and then he
keeps his hand there

690
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
keeps his hand there
 

691
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,710
keeps his hand there
for lord knows what reason

692
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720

 

693
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,110

so the rules of kihon is he has a

694
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
so the rules of kihon is he has a
 

695
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,390
so the rules of kihon is he has a
prescribed energy so he has to do it

696
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
prescribed energy so he has to do it
 

697
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,230
prescribed energy so he has to do it
and i reconcile the energy okay

698
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
and i reconcile the energy okay
 

699
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,830
and i reconcile the energy okay
so he hasn't done some weird counter he

700
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
so he hasn't done some weird counter he
 

701
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,789
so he hasn't done some weird counter he
has to finish that first energy
