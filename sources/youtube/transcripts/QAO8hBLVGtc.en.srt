everybody do it
i'll either do this to get to their joe

354
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
i'll either do this to get to their joe
 

355

361
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,110

where's the next big problem

362
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120

 

363
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,710

the next big problem is

364
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720

 

365
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,950

against a wall
 

417
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,269
against a wall
and a lot of people they do that they go

418
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
and a lot of people they do that they go
 

419
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,030
and a lot of people they do that they go
back into the

they go back and then they go forward
 

423
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,710
they go back and then they go forward
with the scheme

424
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
with the scheme
 

425
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,070
with the scheme
okay so they go back and forth

426
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
okay so they go back and forth
 

427
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,470
okay so they go back and forth

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
and you'll be doing really well it's the
 

593
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,069
and you'll be doing really well it's the
precision that makes
