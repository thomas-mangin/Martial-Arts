so can see him stand up and walk
 

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,269
so can see him stand up and walk
around so if this goes back to the fact

around so if this goes back to the fact
 

5
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,549
around so if this goes back to the fact
that his fingers are going that way so I

6
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
that his fingers are going that way so I
 

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,430
that his fingers are going that way so I
can't go this way

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
can't go this way
 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,750

you
don't move him over

172
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
don't move him over
 

173
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,629
don't move him over
there you have to keep

174
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639

 

175
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,390

turning and you can move in you have to

176
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,400
turning and you can move in you have to
 

177
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,590
turning and you can move in you have to
move them with the push on the what I

178
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
move them with the push on the what I
 

179
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,270
move them with the push on the what I
call the positive

180
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
call the positive
 

181
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,270
call the positive
side not the negative side of that one

182
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,280
side not the negative side of that one
 

183
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,469
side not the negative side of that one
Circle you're going to pull okay

184
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:51,479
Circle you're going to pull okay
 

185
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,070
Circle you're going to pull okay
likewise this is a separate mistake but

186
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
likewise this is a separate mistake but
 

187
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,830
likewise this is a separate mistake but
very common here amongst you is if you

188
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
very common here amongst you is if you
 

189
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,749
very common here amongst you is if you
pay attention my elbow

190
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:00,759
pay attention my elbow
 

191
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,830
pay attention my elbow
always stays inside the young line the

192
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
always stays inside the young line the
 

193
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,590
always stays inside the young line the
outer rim you have a problem when your

194
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
outer rim you have a problem when your
 

195
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,950
outer rim you have a problem when your
elbow outside you're going to always

196
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
elbow outside you're going to always
 

197
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,029
elbow outside you're going to always
pull this thing okay so some of you are

198
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,039
pull this thing okay so some of you are
 

199
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,150
pull this thing okay so some of you are
like okay got the first idea and now you

200
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,160
like okay got the first idea and now you
 

201
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,029
like okay got the first idea and now you
put your elbow outside like this you see

202
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:18,039
put your elbow outside like this you see
 

203
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,110
put your elbow outside like this you see
that this is not tinel handle there's no

204
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
that this is not tinel handle there's no
 

205
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,629
that this is not tinel handle there's no
position like this elbows have to stay

206
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:25,639
position like this elbows have to stay
 

207
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,390
position like this elbows have to stay
on the young line with my shoulders my

208
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
on the young line with my shoulders my
 

209
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,430
on the young line with my shoulders my
hands can come out of that line but not

210
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
hands can come out of that line but not
 

211
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,909
hands can come out of that line but not
my

212
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
my
 

213
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,749
my
elbows if you pay attention when you do

214
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
elbows if you pay attention when you do
 

215
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,790
elbows if you pay attention when you do
that you start to violate the spiral cuz

216
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
that you start to violate the spiral cuz
 

217
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,110
that you start to violate the spiral cuz
we're going this

218
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
we're going this
 

219
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,110
we're going this
way and now you take them the other way

220
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,120
way and now you take them the other way
 

221
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,550
way and now you take them the other way
you see that that is

222
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
you see that that is
 

223
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,150
you see that that is
now oppositional to your original spiral

224
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
now oppositional to your original spiral
 

225
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,110
now oppositional to your original spiral
that you made don't do

226
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
that you made don't do
 

227
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,790
that you made don't do
that boom boom

228
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:57,800

 

229
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,670

off pay attention to the the motion and

230
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,680
off pay attention to the the motion and
 

231
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,710
off pay attention to the the motion and
don't violate these rules of motion

232
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:03,720
don't violate these rules of motion
 

233
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,510
don't violate these rules of motion
there

234
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
there
 

235
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,830
there
go okay

236
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
go okay
 

237
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,870
go okay
so if if you only travel

238
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
so if if you only travel
 

239
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,510
so if if you only travel
through the width dimension you're going

240
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
through the width dimension you're going
 

241
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,990
through the width dimension you're going
to always do this

242
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,000
to always do this
 

243
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,870
to always do this
pull because your circle is going this

244
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:21,880
pull because your circle is going this
 

245
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,029
pull because your circle is going this
way

246
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,039

 

247
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,589

okay so it's going to be a full sooner

248
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:29,599
okay so it's going to be a full sooner
 

249
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,909
okay so it's going to be a full sooner
or later eventually you're going to pull

250
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
or later eventually you're going to pull
 

251
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,629
or later eventually you're going to pull
pull you can see the resistance on

252
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:37,639

 

253
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,629

my so you have to add I want you to add

255
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,309
my so you have to add I want you to add
more of the vertical plane you notice

256
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
more of the vertical plane you notice
 

257
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,870
more of the vertical plane you notice
how this grip's going down you see and

258
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:47,880
how this grip's going down you see and
 

259
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,990
how this grip's going down you see and
the grip the grip goes down before it

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,000
the grip the grip goes down before it
 

261
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,070
the grip the grip goes down before it
comes

262
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
comes
 

263
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,029
comes
in the grip goes down I'm inside the

in the grip goes down I'm inside the
 

265
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,309
in the grip goes down I'm inside the
push and the pull I'm inside it goes

266
00:06:59,309 --> 00:06:59,319
push and the pull I'm inside it goes
 

267
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,070
push and the pull I'm inside it goes
down down and I'm turning it you

268
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
down down and I'm turning it you
 

269

now so if it went
 

291
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,589
now so if it went
down what's it got to do in a yinyang

292
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
down what's it got to do in a yinyang
 

293
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,710
down what's it got to do in a yinyang
world it's got to go up so as I get

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,149
coaching moment as I get myself to the
other side this is where it goes

300
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:53,159
other side this is where it goes
 

301

tactically and you pay
 

315
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,070
tactically and you pay
attention that is how you get the height

316
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,080
attention that is how you get the height

down then it goes up and that is when
 

335
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,550
down then it goes up and that is when
you turn you turn in the up okay try it

00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,750
again okay uh again another thing that
you're going to have to change your

340
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
you're going to have to change your
 

341
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,870
you're going to have to change your
understanding here is at this

342
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
understanding here is at this
 

343
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,590
understanding here is at this
point tital hankle has

344
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:06,600
point tital hankle has
 

345
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,790
point tital hankle has
happened all rotation should have the

346
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:09,800
happened all rotation should have the
 

347
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,150
happened all rotation should have the
rotation that I want should have been

348
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
rotation that I want should have been
 

349
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,190
rotation that I want should have been
done and now you back up into the

350
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
done and now you back up into the
 

351
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,670
done and now you back up into the
neutral

352
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:16,680
neutral
 

353
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,269
neutral
space this I shouldn't have been here

354
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
space this I shouldn't have been here
 

355
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,030
space this I shouldn't have been here
and then I rotate more with that

356
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,040
and then I rotate more with that
 

357
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,870
and then I rotate more with that
foot so for example when here I am

358
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,880
foot so for example when here I am
 

359
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,430
foot so for example when here I am
everything's done

360
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440

 

361
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,110

okay he is done moving and I am on the

362
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
okay he is done moving and I am on the
 

363
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,750
okay he is done moving and I am on the
positive side of the

364
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
positive side of the
 

365
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,630
positive side of the
circle and so now I have structural

366
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
circle and so now I have structural
 

367
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,069
circle and so now I have structural
Integrity against the centrifugal energy

368
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:44,079
Integrity against the centrifugal energy
 

369
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,310
Integrity against the centrifugal energy
okay so if he pulls that way it I'm

370
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
okay so if he pulls that way it I'm
 

371
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,230
okay so if he pulls that way it I'm
grounded on the on the back foot and on

372
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,240
grounded on the on the back foot and on
 

373
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,389
grounded on the on the back foot and on
on the positive side of the

374
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:53,399
on the positive side of the
 

375
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,870
on the positive side of the
circle when I continue to turn him on

376
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:57,880
circle when I continue to turn him on
 

377
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,470
circle when I continue to turn him on
the ten con

378
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
the ten con
 

379
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,509
the ten con
that's not going to happen so when you

380
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519
that's not going to happen so when you
 

381
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,150
that's not going to happen so when you
feel me start to turn you not at the

382
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,160
feel me start to turn you not at the
 

383
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,389
feel me start to turn you not at the
beginning I'm not going to have a

384
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:07,399
beginning I'm not going to have a
 

385
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,509
beginning I'm not going to have a
grounding foot and he'll be able to pull

386
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
grounding foot and he'll be able to pull
 

387
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,350
grounding foot and he'll be able to pull
me see asz I'm trying to do this if for

388
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
me see asz I'm trying to do this if for
 

389
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,829
me see asz I'm trying to do this if for
example we could do it this experiment

390
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
example we could do it this experiment
 

391
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,509
example we could do it this experiment
don't let me move you anymore hold that

392
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:22,519
don't let me move you anymore hold that
 

393
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,670
don't let me move you anymore hold that
in space use all your muscle and I

394
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,680
in space use all your muscle and I
 

395
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,190
in space use all your muscle and I
try to do this

396
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,200
try to do this
 

397
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,829
try to do this
this is not

398
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
this is not
 

399
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,110
this is not
working does not make

400
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
working does not make

sense so boom boom once you're here

402
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:40,760
sense so boom boom once you're here
 

403
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,790
sense so boom boom once you're here
that's it you step into the empty space

404
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
that's it you step into the empty space
 

405
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,750
that's it you step into the empty space
you created that's the

406

the the the ten con has finished I step

412
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
the the the ten con has finished I step
 

413
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,629
the the the ten con has finished I step
into the neutral

414
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:06,639

 

415
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,750

space done no more rotation on here you

416
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:10,760
space done no more rotation on here you
 

417
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,389

that
 

421
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,310
that
right see this is what iido does all the

422
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,320
right see this is what iido does all the
 

423
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,750
right see this is what iido does all the
time you you go like this you see

424
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:24,760
time you you go like this you see
 

425
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,310
time you you go like this you see
that he doesn't want to go don't go

426
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
that he doesn't want to go don't go
 

427
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,230
that he doesn't want to go don't go
there's no way I can do that there's no

428
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,240
there's no way I can do that there's no
 

429
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,509
there's no way I can do that there's no
way you have to single point pivot you

430
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
way you have to single point pivot you
 

431
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,310
way you have to single point pivot you
see and then you step where you need to

432
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,320
see and then you step where you need to
 

433
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,629
see and then you step where you need to
go you

434
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:39,639
go you
 

435
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,910
go you
cannot turn on that

436
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:44,920

 

437
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,430

part so as you go on the turn is here

part so as you go on the turn is here
 

439
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,310
part so as you go on the turn is here
right there then I step into

440
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320

 

441
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,150

step step in the
Neal step in the neutral then I

452
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
Neal step in the neutral then I
 

453
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,590
Neal step in the neutral then I
shouldn't see any movement in him after

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,670
shouldn't see any movement in him after
that stepping in okay try

456
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
that stepping in okay try
 

457
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,350
that stepping in okay try
okay try to understand what I'm

458
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
okay try to understand what I'm
 

459
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,189
okay try to understand what I'm
showing with him trying to pull I can't

460
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:39,199
showing with him trying to pull I can't

I'm going to have a harder problem with
 

473
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,389
I'm going to have a harder problem with
that it could be someone that's pulling

on me see that so I'm just representing

476
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
on me see that so I'm just representing
 

477
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,350
on me see that so I'm just representing
if you give yourself some resistance

478
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,360
if you give yourself some resistance
 

479
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,870
if you give yourself some resistance
don't don't turn your hand anymore and

480
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
don't don't turn your hand anymore and
 

481
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,829
don't don't turn your hand anymore and
you try to do that you're not going to

482
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:08,839
you try to do that you're not going to
 

483
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,269
you try to do that you're not going to
be able to do it

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:12,279
be able to do it
 

485
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,150
be able to do it
okay so the timing

486
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
okay so the timing
 

487
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,750
okay so the timing
is

488
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
is
 

489
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,509
is
