00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,710

hello i'm christopher hine and today

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:04,720
hello i'm christopher hine and today
 

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,389
hello i'm christopher hine and today
we're going to be talking about i forgot

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
we're going to be talking about i forgot
 

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,430
we're going to be talking about i forgot
what i was going to talk because i was

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
what i was going to talk because i was
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,430
what i was going to talk because i was
doing a new intro and i'm all messed up

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
doing a new intro and i'm all messed up
 

9
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,910
doing a new intro and i'm all messed up
but so today

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
but so today
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,110
but so today
today we're going to talk about

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
today we're going to talk about
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,630
today we're going to talk about
force angle in

14
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
force angle in
 

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,910
force angle in
the the uh ipitis so internal training

16
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
the the uh ipitis so internal training
 

17
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,470
the the uh ipitis so internal training
so we're looking at internal training um

18
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
so we're looking at internal training um
 

19
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,150
so we're looking at internal training um
one of the ways i like to break that up

20
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
one of the ways i like to break that up
 

21
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,029
one of the ways i like to break that up
is force angle force angle

22
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
is force angle force angle
 

23
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,029
is force angle force angle
could be used for an alignment right so

24
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
could be used for an alignment right so
 

25
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,710
could be used for an alignment right so
you could say an alignment is a force

26
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
you could say an alignment is a force
 

27
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,030
you could say an alignment is a force
angle and sometimes we'll also use force

28
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
angle and sometimes we'll also use force
 

29
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,709
angle and sometimes we'll also use force
angles that go perpendicular depending

30
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
angles that go perpendicular depending
 

31
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,549
angles that go perpendicular depending
on what we want to achieve so we're

32
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
on what we want to achieve so we're
 

33
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,910
on what we want to achieve so we're
talking about all the internal power

34
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
talking about all the internal power
 

35
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,590
talking about all the internal power
stuff you got to understand that

36
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
stuff you got to understand that
 

37
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,709
stuff you got to understand that
we're using both sides of it right so to

38
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
we're using both sides of it right so to
 

39
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,869
we're using both sides of it right so to
seem like we are more powerful sometimes

40
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
seem like we are more powerful sometimes
 

41
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,110
seem like we are more powerful sometimes
and also to make other people seem like

42
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
and also to make other people seem like
 

43
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,869
and also to make other people seem like
they are weaker right or you don't tell

44
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
they are weaker right or you don't tell
 

45
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,310
they are weaker right or you don't tell
them they're weak or you tell them that

46
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
them they're weak or you tell them that
 

47
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,430
them they're weak or you tell them that
they uh

48
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
they uh
 

49
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,270
they uh
that you're so strong you can resist

50
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
that you're so strong you can resist
 

51
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,029
that you're so strong you can resist
what they're doing right but uh it's

52
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
what they're doing right but uh it's
 

53
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,189
what they're doing right but uh it's
it's a it's a it's a way to change the

54
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
it's a it's a it's a way to change the
 

55
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,430
it's a it's a it's a way to change the
angle of the force to what they're doing

56
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
angle of the force to what they're doing
 

57
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,670
angle of the force to what they're doing
and it'll be deceptive for them and make

58
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
and it'll be deceptive for them and make
 

59
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,110
and it'll be deceptive for them and make
it really hard for them to make a lot of

60
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
it really hard for them to make a lot of
 

61
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,590
it really hard for them to make a lot of
force and then also you can improve the

62
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
force and then also you can improve the
 

63
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,030
force and then also you can improve the
angle to align the angle to make

64
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
angle to align the angle to make
 

65
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,270
angle to align the angle to make
yourself seem really strong so i know

66
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
yourself seem really strong so i know
 

67
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,789
yourself seem really strong so i know
this might sound confusing but i bet i

68
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
this might sound confusing but i bet i
 

69
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,230
this might sound confusing but i bet i
can clear it up right now i'll call josh

70
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
can clear it up right now i'll call josh
 

71
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,940
can clear it up right now i'll call josh
over here we'll go to work josh

72
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:15,950
over here we'll go to work josh
 

73
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,690
over here we'll go to work josh

79
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,350

all right so let's talk about force

80
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
all right so let's talk about force
 

81
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,789
all right so let's talk about force
angle here okay um so uh force angle

82
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
angle here okay um so uh force angle
 

83
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,310
angle here okay um so uh force angle
might be a weird way to say this it's

84
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
might be a weird way to say this it's
 

85
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,550
might be a weird way to say this it's
just the way i say it um it's because it

86
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
just the way i say it um it's because it
 

87
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,389
just the way i say it um it's because it
incorporates a whole lot of different

88
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
incorporates a whole lot of different
 

89
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,630
incorporates a whole lot of different
weird stuff um

90
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
weird stuff um
 

91
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,870
weird stuff um
the way that force is applied and the

92
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
the way that force is applied and the
 

93
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,429
the way that force is applied and the
angle of that force and the angle of the

94
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
angle of that force and the angle of the
 

95
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,190
angle of that force and the angle of the
force that's resisting it is really

96
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
force that's resisting it is really
 

97
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,270
force that's resisting it is really
really important right so most of the

98
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
really important right so most of the
 

99
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,950
really important right so most of the
time the way our brains kind of think of

100
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
time the way our brains kind of think of
 

101
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,389
time the way our brains kind of think of
force is like this so if josh had his

102
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
force is like this so if josh had his
 

103
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,310
force is like this so if josh had his
hands up and he's pushing against me

104
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
hands up and he's pushing against me
 

105
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,469
hands up and he's pushing against me
that i push against josh's hands and so

106
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
that i push against josh's hands and so
 

107
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,990
that i push against josh's hands and so
his force is coming this way and my

108
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
his force is coming this way and my
 

109
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,510
his force is coming this way and my
force is coming that way and if josh is

110
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
force is coming that way and if josh is
 

111
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,270
force is coming that way and if josh is
stronger than me he'll push me over and

112
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
stronger than me he'll push me over and
 

113
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,109
stronger than me he'll push me over and
if i'm stronger than josh i push josh

114
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
if i'm stronger than josh i push josh
 

115
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,430
if i'm stronger than josh i push josh
over right so that's a real common way

116
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
over right so that's a real common way
 

117
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,470
over right so that's a real common way
to think of it i'm going to show it with

118
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
to think of it i'm going to show it with
 

119
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,229
to think of it i'm going to show it with
the stick because this stick to me makes

120
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
the stick because this stick to me makes
 

121
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,309
the stick because this stick to me makes
a makes a demonstration kind of fun okay

122
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
a makes a demonstration kind of fun okay
 

123
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,190
a makes a demonstration kind of fun okay
so

124
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
so
 

125
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,550
so
so if i was showing you that and i was

126
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
so if i was showing you that and i was
 

127
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,830
so if i was showing you that and i was
telling you that you know josh is going

128
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
telling you that you know josh is going
 

129
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,510
telling you that you know josh is going
to push me over and so his objective is

130
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
to push me over and so his objective is
 

131
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,030
to push me over and so his objective is
just to push me straight over like that

132
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
just to push me straight over like that
 

133
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,869
just to push me straight over like that
okay and i stand here like this and josh

134
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
okay and i stand here like this and josh
 

135
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,949
okay and i stand here like this and josh
goes to push me over okay now look he's

136
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
goes to push me over okay now look he's
 

137
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,869
goes to push me over okay now look he's
pushing pretty dang hard he's pushing

138
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
pushing pretty dang hard he's pushing
 

139
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,710
pushing pretty dang hard he's pushing
pretty hard and i'm on one foot and this

140
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
pretty hard and i'm on one foot and this
 

141
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,350
pretty hard and i'm on one foot and this
guy can't shove me over and why can't he

142
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
guy can't shove me over and why can't he
 

143
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,589
guy can't shove me over and why can't he
shove me over right well he can't shove

144
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
shove me over right well he can't shove
 

145
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,070
shove me over right well he can't shove
me over because while josh is pushing

146
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
me over because while josh is pushing
 

147
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,229
me over because while josh is pushing
this direction i'm pushing this

148
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
this direction i'm pushing this
 

149
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,710
this direction i'm pushing this
direction so the angle of the force that

150
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
direction so the angle of the force that
 

151
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,869
direction so the angle of the force that
i'm resisting him with isn't this way

152
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
i'm resisting him with isn't this way
 

153
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,710
i'm resisting him with isn't this way
right and if i'm on one foot and josh

154
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
right and if i'm on one foot and josh
 

155
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,470
right and if i'm on one foot and josh
pushes against me and i'm on one foot

156
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
pushes against me and i'm on one foot
 

157
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,830
pushes against me and i'm on one foot
this is what happens right he just

158
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
this is what happens right he just
 

159
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,229
this is what happens right he just
pushes me right over because i'm trying

160
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
pushes me right over because i'm trying
 

161
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,990
pushes me right over because i'm trying
i'm not stable as josh isn't so when

162
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
i'm not stable as josh isn't so when
 

163
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,990
i'm not stable as josh isn't so when
we're pushing this way he'll win but

164
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
we're pushing this way he'll win but
 

165
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,949
we're pushing this way he'll win but
when i push up like this josh's muscles

166
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
when i push up like this josh's muscles
 

167
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,589
when i push up like this josh's muscles
can't work two directions at one time

168
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
can't work two directions at one time
 

169
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,309
can't work two directions at one time
they either have to go this way or this

170
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
they either have to go this way or this
 

171
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,229
they either have to go this way or this
way so if i'm pushing against him this

172
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
way so if i'm pushing against him this
 

173
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,149
way so if i'm pushing against him this
way he will start to naturally even

174
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
way he will start to naturally even
 

175
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,990
way he will start to naturally even
without him knowing it start pushing

176
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
without him knowing it start pushing
 

177
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,270
without him knowing it start pushing
down right so he's going to start

178
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
down right so he's going to start
 

179
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,190
down right so he's going to start
pushing against me down now what that

180
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
pushing against me down now what that
 

181
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,670
pushing against me down now what that
does is actually roots me a little more

182
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
does is actually roots me a little more
 

183
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,630
does is actually roots me a little more
right so makes me a little more

184
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
right so makes me a little more
 

185
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,149
right so makes me a little more
connected to him to the ground and him a

186
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
connected to him to the ground and him a
 

187
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,910
connected to him to the ground and him a
little less connected to the ground so

188
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
little less connected to the ground so
 

189
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,710
little less connected to the ground so
that helps plus he cannot push as hard

190
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
that helps plus he cannot push as hard
 

191
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,949
that helps plus he cannot push as hard
this way because he's using his force

192
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
this way because he's using his force
 

193
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,789
this way because he's using his force
this way so he's kind of alternating his

194
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
this way so he's kind of alternating his
 

195
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,630
this way so he's kind of alternating his
force between down and out and down and

196
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
force between down and out and down and
 

197
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,470
force between down and out and down and
out and down and out so he feels about

198
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
out and down and out so he feels about
 

199
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,229
out and down and out so he feels about
half as strong as he normally would be

200
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
half as strong as he normally would be
 

201
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,430
half as strong as he normally would be
because he's using about half as much

202
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
because he's using about half as much
 

203
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,110
because he's using about half as much
force right so the time's alternating

204
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
force right so the time's alternating
 

205
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,270
force right so the time's alternating
between the two so while josh is pushing

206
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
between the two so while josh is pushing
 

207
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,229
between the two so while josh is pushing
directly into me this way i'm pushing up

208
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
directly into me this way i'm pushing up
 

209
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,750
directly into me this way i'm pushing up
against him and it makes me seem really

210
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
against him and it makes me seem really
 

211
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,309
against him and it makes me seem really
strong there was a woman

212
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
strong there was a woman
 

213
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,390
strong there was a woman
who went all around the world showing

214
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
who went all around the world showing
 

215
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,229
who went all around the world showing
these demonstrations back at the turn of

216
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
these demonstrations back at the turn of
 

217
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,750
these demonstrations back at the turn of
the century they called it the georgia

218
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
the century they called it the georgia
 

219
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,789
the century they called it the georgia
magnet there's actually several

220
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
magnet there's actually several
 

221
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,149
magnet there's actually several
different variations that showed these

222
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
different variations that showed these
 

223
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,869
different variations that showed these
different um kinds of demonstrations and

224
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
different um kinds of demonstrations and
 

225
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,589
different um kinds of demonstrations and
basically force angle was her number one

226
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
basically force angle was her number one
 

227
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,110
basically force angle was her number one
trick right she did a few other things

228
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
trick right she did a few other things
 

229
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,470
trick right she did a few other things
but force angles are number one and

230
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
but force angles are number one and
 

231
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,710
but force angles are number one and
force angle is really really deceptive

232
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
force angle is really really deceptive
 

233
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,309
force angle is really really deceptive
when you're doing that now force angle

234
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
when you're doing that now force angle
 

235
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,550
when you're doing that now force angle
can be uh used in another way and we use

236
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
can be uh used in another way and we use
 

237
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,070
can be uh used in another way and we use
it all the time we do the demonstration

238
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
it all the time we do the demonstration
 

239
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,910
it all the time we do the demonstration
so like if josh pushes into me like this

240
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
so like if josh pushes into me like this
 

241
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,270
so like if josh pushes into me like this
and he pushes into me right and i'm

242
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and he pushes into me right and i'm
 

243
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,509
and he pushes into me right and i'm
really stable this is also force angle

244
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
really stable this is also force angle
 

245
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,710
really stable this is also force angle
now this is working in a different way

246
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
now this is working in a different way
 

247
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
now this is working in a different way
because what i'm doing is i'm allowing

248
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
because what i'm doing is i'm allowing
 

249
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,550
because what i'm doing is i'm allowing
that force to come in as straight into

250
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
that force to come in as straight into
 

251
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,390
that force to come in as straight into
my body as i can and be into the ground

252
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
my body as i can and be into the ground
 

253
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,909
my body as i can and be into the ground
right so the force angle of this uh joe

254
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
right so the force angle of this uh joe
 

255
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,749
right so the force angle of this uh joe
right now is really good it's really

256
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
right now is really good it's really
 

257
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,510
right now is really good it's really
strong so if i push down into it oh i

258
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
strong so if i push down into it oh i
 

259
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,710
strong so if i push down into it oh i
can't push it down because it's so

260
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
can't push it down because it's so
 

261
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,469
can't push it down because it's so
strong and essentially when i'm

262
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
strong and essentially when i'm
 

263
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,310
strong and essentially when i'm
resisting josh like that this is what

264
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
resisting josh like that this is what
 

265
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,230
resisting josh like that this is what
i'm doing i'm kind of lining this up now

266
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
i'm doing i'm kind of lining this up now
 

267
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,310
i'm doing i'm kind of lining this up now
if it would be perfect it would be

268
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
if it would be perfect it would be
 

269
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,670
if it would be perfect it would be
perfect if i could put my feet against

270
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
perfect if i could put my feet against
 

271
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,950
perfect if i could put my feet against
the wall and completely resist him i'd

272
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
the wall and completely resist him i'd
 

273
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,790
the wall and completely resist him i'd
be really strong or if josh stood on my

274
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
be really strong or if josh stood on my
 

275
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,710
be really strong or if josh stood on my
shoulders the force would go perfectly

276
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
shoulders the force would go perfectly
 

277
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
shoulders the force would go perfectly
down into the ground i'd be really

278
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
down into the ground i'd be really
 

279
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,070
down into the ground i'd be really
strong right i'd seem very very strong

280
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
strong right i'd seem very very strong
 

281
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,749
strong right i'd seem very very strong
but it's just the angle of the force i'm

282
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
but it's just the angle of the force i'm
 

283
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,270
but it's just the angle of the force i'm
allowing that force to come into a way

284
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
allowing that force to come into a way
 

285
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,670
allowing that force to come into a way
that i'm super super stable so that's

286
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
that i'm super super stable so that's
 

287
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,710
that i'm super super stable so that's
also a demonstration of force angle

288
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
also a demonstration of force angle
 

289
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,030
also a demonstration of force angle
if we were down here like this and i

290
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
if we were down here like this and i
 

291
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,550
if we were down here like this and i
showed this demonstration last time we

292
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
showed this demonstration last time we
 

293
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,590
showed this demonstration last time we
would go ahead and sit and says it with

294
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
would go ahead and sit and says it with
 

295
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,590
would go ahead and sit and says it with
me um so i showed this demonstration

296
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
me um so i showed this demonstration
 

297
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,670
me um so i showed this demonstration
last time on the leverage um if we're

298
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
last time on the leverage um if we're
 

299
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,430
last time on the leverage um if we're
like this and josh is pushing my hand

300
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
like this and josh is pushing my hand
 

301
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,870
like this and josh is pushing my hand
straight down to the ground so he's

302
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
straight down to the ground so he's
 

303
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,390
straight down to the ground so he's
trying to lock my hands down now if i

304
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
trying to lock my hands down now if i
 

305
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,230
trying to lock my hands down now if i
try to go directly against josh's force

306
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
try to go directly against josh's force
 

307
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,310
try to go directly against josh's force
up into them i can't do it but if i

308
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
up into them i can't do it but if i
 

309
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,469
up into them i can't do it but if i
change the force angle all of a sudden i

310
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
change the force angle all of a sudden i
 

311
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,670
change the force angle all of a sudden i
seem so friggin strong why because when

312
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
seem so friggin strong why because when
 

313
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,670
seem so friggin strong why because when
josh is pushing my hand this way instead

314
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
josh is pushing my hand this way instead
 

315
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,909
josh is pushing my hand this way instead
of pushing against his hand this way i'm

316
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
of pushing against his hand this way i'm
 

317
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,590
of pushing against his hand this way i'm
pulling my hand at a 90 degree angle to

318
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
pulling my hand at a 90 degree angle to
 

319
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,189
pulling my hand at a 90 degree angle to
his force so when he pushes down i pull

320
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
his force so when he pushes down i pull
 

321
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,029
his force so when he pushes down i pull
up like this now i can make my force

322
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
up like this now i can make my force
 

323
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,390
up like this now i can make my force
angle zero like we learned in the

324
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
angle zero like we learned in the
 

325
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,990
angle zero like we learned in the
leverage and i can drive into him and i

326
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
leverage and i can drive into him and i
 

327
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
leverage and i can drive into him and i
seem really really really strong the

328
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
seem really really really strong the
 

329
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,909
seem really really really strong the
reason is because i initially used force

330
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
reason is because i initially used force
 

331
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,510
reason is because i initially used force
angle to take away from the force that

332
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
angle to take away from the force that
 

333
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,029
angle to take away from the force that
he was using to lock me down to the

334
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
he was using to lock me down to the
 

335
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,270
he was using to lock me down to the
ground and then i aligned my force so i

336
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
ground and then i aligned my force so i
 

337
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,469
ground and then i aligned my force so i
go straight into them and i get the

338
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
go straight into them and i get the
 

339
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,749
go straight into them and i get the
better leverage like we talked about

340
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
better leverage like we talked about
 

341
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,430
better leverage like we talked about
last time and that's how that works

342
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
last time and that's how that works
 

343
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,390
last time and that's how that works
right

344
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
right
 

345
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,189
right
so there's tons and tons of ways to use

346
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
so there's tons and tons of ways to use
 

347
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,350
so there's tons and tons of ways to use
force angle just remember if someone's

348
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
force angle just remember if someone's
 

349
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,070
force angle just remember if someone's
trying to push at you pushing directly

350
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
trying to push at you pushing directly
 

351
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,430
trying to push at you pushing directly
back at them unless you're stronger

352
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
back at them unless you're stronger
 

353
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,670
back at them unless you're stronger
isn't a good idea but you can change the

354
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
isn't a good idea but you can change the
 

355
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,670
isn't a good idea but you can change the
angle of the force and when you do that

356
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
angle of the force and when you do that
 

357
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,270
angle of the force and when you do that
it'll be much harder for them to attack

358
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
it'll be much harder for them to attack
 

359
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,550
it'll be much harder for them to attack
you because their muscle only works in

360
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
you because their muscle only works in
 

361
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,029
you because their muscle only works in
one direction at a time so this is a

362
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
one direction at a time so this is a
 

363
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,710
one direction at a time so this is a
basic overview of force angle if it

364
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
basic overview of force angle if it
 

365
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,550
basic overview of force angle if it
seems a little fuzzy let me know and

366
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
seems a little fuzzy let me know and
 

367
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,909
seems a little fuzzy let me know and
i'll make some more videos last time

368
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
i'll make some more videos last time
 

369
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,670
i'll make some more videos last time
maya told me my leverage video i talked

370
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
maya told me my leverage video i talked
 

371
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,590
maya told me my leverage video i talked
too fast so maybe i'll come back in and

372
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
too fast so maybe i'll come back in and
 

373
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,110
too fast so maybe i'll come back in and
i'll make somewhere i talk a little

374
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
i'll make somewhere i talk a little
 

375
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,390
i'll make somewhere i talk a little
slower actually maybe i'll just write it

376
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
slower actually maybe i'll just write it
 

377
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,510
slower actually maybe i'll just write it
out and then you can read it at whatever

378
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
out and then you can read it at whatever
 

379
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,590
out and then you can read it at whatever
pace you would like to read it at

380
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
pace you would like to read it at
 

381
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,670
pace you would like to read it at
so that's force angle i'm going to come

382
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
so that's force angle i'm going to come
 

383
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,510
so that's force angle i'm going to come
in next time and talk to you a little

384
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
in next time and talk to you a little
 

385
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,870
in next time and talk to you a little
bit more about how this kind of stuff

386
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
bit more about how this kind of stuff
 

387
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,790
bit more about how this kind of stuff
works i'll i'll describe a few of the

388
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
works i'll i'll describe a few of the
 

389
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,749
works i'll i'll describe a few of the
other ones
