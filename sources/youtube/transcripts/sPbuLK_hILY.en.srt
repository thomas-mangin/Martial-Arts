00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
um the last video in this one are a
 

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,950
um the last video in this one are a
little bit of a misnomer as far as

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
little bit of a misnomer as far as
 

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,950
little bit of a misnomer as far as
specifically doing footwork we're

14
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
specifically doing footwork we're
 

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,550
specifically doing footwork we're
working on taino hinko now which is

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
working on taino hinko now which is
 

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,550
working on taino hinko now which is
kind of a variation of that it has to do

18
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
kind of a variation of that it has to do
 

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,830
kind of a variation of that it has to do
more though with the relationship

20
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
more though with the relationship
 

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,750
more though with the relationship
between you and another person or other

22
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
between you and another person or other
 

23
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,470
between you and another person or other
people

24
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
people
 

25
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,750
people
so in this video we're actually going to

26
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
so in this video we're actually going to
 

27
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,510
so in this video we're actually going to
talk about multiple uh

28
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
talk about multiple uh
 

29
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,910
talk about multiple uh
people and how the titanohinka works for

30
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
people and how the titanohinka works for
 

31
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,670
people and how the titanohinka works for
that so how do i vary my position

32
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
that so how do i vary my position
 

33
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,670
that so how do i vary my position
when there are multiple people involved

34
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
when there are multiple people involved
 

35
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,869
when there are multiple people involved
in this video we're just going to use

36
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
in this video we're just going to use
 

37
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,590
in this video we're just going to use
two people

38
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
two people
 

39
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,630
two people
from the two people you could

40
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
from the two people you could
 

41
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,150
from the two people you could
extrapolate beyond that but quite

42
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
extrapolate beyond that but quite
 

43
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,190
extrapolate beyond that but quite
honestly once it

44
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
honestly once it
 

45
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,350
honestly once it
gets beyond two people it becomes very

46
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
gets beyond two people it becomes very
 

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,110
gets beyond two people it becomes very
very challenging to position yourself

48
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
very challenging to position yourself
 

49
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,430
very challenging to position yourself
right

50
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
right
 

51
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,029
right
so with two people you can see the clear

52
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
so with two people you can see the clear
 

53
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,549
so with two people you can see the clear
ideas and get an idea of

54
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
ideas and get an idea of
 

55
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,069
ideas and get an idea of
where you should be cutting when you're

56
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
where you should be cutting when you're
 

57
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,750
where you should be cutting when you're
in a multiple attacker situation

58
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
in a multiple attacker situation
 

59
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,189
in a multiple attacker situation
so i'm going to call josh and mai over

60
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
so i'm going to call josh and mai over
 

61
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,790
so i'm going to call josh and mai over
here and we're going to work on the

62
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
here and we're going to work on the
 

63
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,030
here and we're going to work on the
multiple attacker taino hinko

64
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040

 

65
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,750

okay so this week or this today we're

66
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
okay so this week or this today we're
 

67
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,710
okay so this week or this today we're
going to talk about

68
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
going to talk about
 

69
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,950
going to talk about
the basic tiny hinko as it relates to

70
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
the basic tiny hinko as it relates to
 

71
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,070
the basic tiny hinko as it relates to
two attackers

72
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
two attackers
 

73
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,830
two attackers
now once you understand these concepts

74
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
now once you understand these concepts
 

75
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,670
now once you understand these concepts
for two attackers you can scale up to as

76
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
for two attackers you can scale up to as
 

77
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,270
for two attackers you can scale up to as
many attacks as you want it just becomes

78
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
many attacks as you want it just becomes
 

79
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,789
many attacks as you want it just becomes
harder and harder to see them

80
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
harder and harder to see them
 

81
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,030
harder and harder to see them
and your your goals become more and more

82
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
and your your goals become more and more
 

83
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,990
and your your goals become more and more
narrow because

84
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
narrow because
 

85
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,590
narrow because
it's just difficult to deal with a whole

86
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
it's just difficult to deal with a whole
 

87
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,190
it's just difficult to deal with a whole
lot of people so when we have two

88
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
lot of people so when we have two
 

89
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,230
lot of people so when we have two
attackers like this

90
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
attackers like this
 

91
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,710
attackers like this
we call this position the v position now

92
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
we call this position the v position now
 

93
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,830
we call this position the v position now
the reason is because

94
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
the reason is because
 

95
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,670
the reason is because
they're in a v to me so if you look at

96
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
they're in a v to me so if you look at
 

97
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,350
they're in a v to me so if you look at
me as being the center and they v

98
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
me as being the center and they v
 

99
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,190
me as being the center and they v
out here like this this is a bad

100
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
out here like this this is a bad
 

101
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,030
out here like this this is a bad
position probably the second worst

102
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
position probably the second worst
 

103
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,149
position probably the second worst
position you're going to be in

104
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
position you're going to be in
 

105
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,149
position you're going to be in
now the reason is because these two are

106
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
now the reason is because these two are
 

107
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,069
now the reason is because these two are
on a flat plane with each other

108
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
on a flat plane with each other
 

109
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,310
on a flat plane with each other
so they're able to adjust really well to

110
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
so they're able to adjust really well to
 

111
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,670
so they're able to adjust really well to
me every time i move so

112
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
me every time i move so
 

113
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,429
me every time i move so
if i were for example to take a step

114
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
if i were for example to take a step
 

115
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,270
if i were for example to take a step
this way josh can come in here a little

116
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
this way josh can come in here a little
 

117
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,590
this way josh can come in here a little
bit

118
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
bit
 

119
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,510
bit
and he's kept that b so if i'm trying to

120
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
and he's kept that b so if i'm trying to
 

121
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,190
and he's kept that b so if i'm trying to
get that way it's really really hard

122
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
get that way it's really really hard
 

123
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,510
get that way it's really really hard
right

124
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
right
 

125
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,590
right
if i'm trying to get over here maya can

126
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
if i'm trying to get over here maya can
 

127
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,429
if i'm trying to get over here maya can
cut in on me and she can start to make

128
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
cut in on me and she can start to make
 

129
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,789
cut in on me and she can start to make
that bead this way right so

130
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
that bead this way right so
 

131
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,389
that bead this way right so
these guys can always cut around to make

132
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
these guys can always cut around to make
 

133
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,230
these guys can always cut around to make
a a wall

134
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
a a wall
 

135
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,309
a a wall
that's very difficult for me to get past

136
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
that's very difficult for me to get past
 

137
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,830
that's very difficult for me to get past
now if you look at just me

138
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
now if you look at just me
 

139
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,910
now if you look at just me
my ideas are the same right so well i

140
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
my ideas are the same right so well i
 

141
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,110
my ideas are the same right so well i
don't want to be like this

142
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
don't want to be like this
 

143
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,790
don't want to be like this
i want to get to a haunted position

144
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
i want to get to a haunted position
 

145
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,550
i want to get to a haunted position
right so now it's starting to get behind

146
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
right so now it's starting to get behind
 

147
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,309
right so now it's starting to get behind
me and this leads us to another position

148
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
me and this leads us to another position
 

149
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,470
me and this leads us to another position
which is called a staggered position now

150
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
which is called a staggered position now
 

151
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,750
which is called a staggered position now
i'm going to have them go to it just

152
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
i'm going to have them go to it just
 

153
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,190
i'm going to have them go to it just
because it's too hard to move the camera

154
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
because it's too hard to move the camera
 

155
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,150
because it's too hard to move the camera
around right now so i'm gonna have you

156
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
around right now so i'm gonna have you
 

157
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,510
around right now so i'm gonna have you
guys go ahead and move to a stagger for

158
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
guys go ahead and move to a stagger for
 

159
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,110
guys go ahead and move to a stagger for
me

160
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
me
 

161
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710
me
okay perfect and just take a little step

162
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
okay perfect and just take a little step
 

163
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,910
okay perfect and just take a little step
that way all right so now they're

164
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
that way all right so now they're
 

165
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,550
that way all right so now they're
staggered

166
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
staggered
 

167
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,070
staggered
so they're not shoulder to shoulder

168
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
so they're not shoulder to shoulder
 

169
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,070
so they're not shoulder to shoulder
anymore so they don't have a solid wall

170
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
anymore so they don't have a solid wall
 

171
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,670
anymore so they don't have a solid wall
one of them is a little head of the

172
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
one of them is a little head of the
 

173
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,430
one of them is a little head of the
other one right now i could do that by

174
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
other one right now i could do that by
 

175
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,350
other one right now i could do that by
either them moving one moves faster than

176
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
either them moving one moves faster than
 

177
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,910
either them moving one moves faster than
the other and

178
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
the other and
 

179
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,190
the other and
they don't stay in a nice alignment

180
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
they don't stay in a nice alignment
 

181
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,710
they don't stay in a nice alignment
together which is if they're attacking

182
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
together which is if they're attacking
 

183
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,990
together which is if they're attacking
me that is totally what they should do

184
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
me that is totally what they should do
 

185
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,630
me that is totally what they should do
is stay

186
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
is stay
 

187
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,070
is stay
shoulder to shoulder because that makes

188
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
shoulder to shoulder because that makes
 

189
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,509
shoulder to shoulder because that makes
it the most difficult for me to deal

190
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
it the most difficult for me to deal
 

191
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,270
it the most difficult for me to deal
with but if i can either trick them into

192
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
with but if i can either trick them into
 

193
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,270
with but if i can either trick them into
moving faster or slower to this position

194
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
moving faster or slower to this position
 

195
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,830
moving faster or slower to this position
or i could move myself will stagger so

196
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
or i could move myself will stagger so
 

197
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,270
or i could move myself will stagger so

moved myself over i've now achieved a
stagger so essentially i've done the

218

stagger so essentially i've done the
 

219
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,030
stagger so essentially i've done the
same thing

stagger it which is
 

321
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,110
stagger it which is
equivalent behind me and then stack it

322
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
equivalent behind me and then stack it
 

323
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,110
equivalent behind me and then stack it
right up into an eye like this now when

324

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,950
love to exploit these times because when
you're working with two cases sometimes

494
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
you're working with two cases sometimes
 

495
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,309
you're working with two cases sometimes
you can really trick them good with it

496
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
you can really trick them good with it
 

497
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,670
you can really trick them good with it
but as a general rule and especially

498
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
but as a general rule and especially
 

499
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,790
but as a general rule and especially
when you're just beginning to work with

500
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
when you're just beginning to work with
 

501
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,150
when you're just beginning to work with
multiple attackers you can't shoot

502
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
multiple attackers you can't shoot
 

503
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,270
multiple attackers you can't shoot
through the middle that's a trap

504
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
through the middle that's a trap
 

505
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,830
through the middle that's a trap
position

506
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
position
 

507
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,189
position
the reason it's a trap is because once

508
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
the reason it's a trap is because once
 

509
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,870
the reason it's a trap is because once
i'm here i can't deal with both these

510
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
i'm here i can't deal with both these
 

511
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,909
i'm here i can't deal with both these
guys at the same time it's going to be

512
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
guys at the same time it's going to be
 

513
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,589
guys at the same time it's going to be
in a bad position we have to learn nina

514
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
in a bad position we have to learn nina
 

515
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,710
in a bad position we have to learn nina
and dory from here so

516
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
and dory from here so
 

517
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,309
and dory from here so
we'll get to those techniques but it's a

518
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
we'll get to those techniques but it's a
 

519
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,469
we'll get to those techniques but it's a
bad position for me so real quick i'm

520
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
bad position for me so real quick i'm
 

521
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,390
bad position for me so real quick i'm
going to review the basic ideas we have

522
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
going to review the basic ideas we have
 

523
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,670
going to review the basic ideas we have
so this is a v

524
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
so this is a v
 

525
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,950
so this is a v
if they were to be staggered

526
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
if they were to be staggered
 

527
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,469
if they were to be staggered
this is a staggered position right with

528
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
this is a staggered position right with
 

529
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,230
this is a staggered position right with
my little back josh a little forward

530
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
my little back josh a little forward
 

531
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,390
my little back josh a little forward
they could also put me into an eye or i

532
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
they could also put me into an eye or i
 

533
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,830
they could also put me into an eye or i
could put them into an eye either way

534
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
could put them into an eye either way
 

535
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,029
could put them into an eye either way
this is where they're both lined up

536
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
this is where they're both lined up
 

537
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,550
this is where they're both lined up
which is good for me that's the best

538
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
which is good for me that's the best
 

539
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,909
which is good for me that's the best
position or i could be in the worst

540
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
position or i could be in the worst
 

541
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,629
position or i could be in the worst
position

542
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
position
 

543
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,150
position
which is to be in a trap here in the

544
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
which is to be in a trap here in the
 

545
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,150
which is to be in a trap here in the
middle these are the basic multiple

546
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
middle these are the basic multiple
 

547
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,950
middle these are the basic multiple
attackers

548
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
