this is no difference
 

283
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,220
this is no difference
this is still team you see this step I

284
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,230
this is still team you see this step I
 

285
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,680
this is still team you see this step I
can't even it's not this is we're

286
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,690
can't even it's not this is we're
 

287
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,960
can't even it's not this is we're
connected right here will connect okay

288
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:06,970
connected right here will connect okay
 

289
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,590
connected right here will connect okay
so is it right here okay I generate

290
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:10,600
so is it right here okay I generate
 

291
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,580
so is it right here okay I generate
enough friction or I can move okay I

292

00:28:42,020 --> 00:29:17,360

this man

336
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,370

343
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,769

projection non-phonetic it's not reject

344
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:35,779
projection non-phonetic it's not reject
 

345
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:44,080
projection non-phonetic it's not reject
you or coming in do you understand so

346
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,090
you or coming in do you understand so
 

347
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,200
you or coming in do you understand so
this time

348
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,210
this time
 

349
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:54,149
this time
yeah yes projection the to work together

350
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
yeah yes projection the to work together
 

351
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,570
yeah yes projection the to work together
project you stop coming in okay and

352
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:57,580
project you stop coming in okay and
 

353
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:04,990
project you stop coming in okay and
friction just here IP friction distinct

354
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,000
friction just here IP friction distinct
 

355
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,620
friction just here IP friction distinct
IP friction you see like here we go I'm

356
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,630
IP friction you see like here we go I'm
 

357
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,399
IP friction you see like here we go I'm
right here here

358
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:12,409
right here here
 

359
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,370
right here here
I see friction no fault i friction and

360
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:15,380
I see friction no fault i friction and
 

361
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,840
I see friction no fault i friction and
in yon projection

362
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:18,850
in yon projection
 

363
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:24,210
in yon projection
not true Yong it's not true you Hey
