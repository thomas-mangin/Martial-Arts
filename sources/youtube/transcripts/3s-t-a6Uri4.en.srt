1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,380

okay let's let's figure out how to

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,390
okay let's let's figure out how to
 

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,140
okay let's let's figure out how to
develop the skill for blending with

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,150
develop the skill for blending with
 

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,860
develop the skill for blending with
ballistics let's try this okay start

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:12,870
ballistics let's try this okay start
 

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,180
ballistics let's try this okay start
with fixated motion and his grip his

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,190
with fixated motion and his grip his
 

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,450
with fixated motion and his grip his
structure is helping me find the in

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,460
structure is helping me find the in
 

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,570
structure is helping me find the in
spaces in it okay so I'm not going like

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,580
spaces in it okay so I'm not going like
 

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:34,790
spaces in it okay so I'm not going like
this I am using his grip to blend so

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
this I am using his grip to blend so
 

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,330
this I am using his grip to blend so
that becomes effortless he's pushing and

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340
that becomes effortless he's pushing and
 

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,229
that becomes effortless he's pushing and
I find my way around all of those

18
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
I find my way around all of those
 

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:53,360
I find my way around all of those
obstacles and get it to work

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,370

 

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,030

so if you look home home not like this

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,040
so if you look home home not like this
 

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,380
so if you look home home not like this
you see that difference

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,390
you see that difference
 

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,470
you see that difference
okay so boom body body the here is he's

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,480
okay so boom body body the here is he's
 

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,000
okay so boom body body the here is he's
pushing and you're gonna see the

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,010
pushing and you're gonna see the
 

29
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,850
pushing and you're gonna see the
difference do you see uh not it okay

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:11,860
difference do you see uh not it okay
 

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,860
difference do you see uh not it okay
boom so I'm in the way

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:16,870
boom so I'm in the way
 

33
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,080
boom so I'm in the way
you see I'm in the way and I'm going to

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,090
you see I'm in the way and I'm going to
 

35
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:29,700
you see I'm in the way and I'm going to
move out of the way watch my head that

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:29,710
move out of the way watch my head that
 

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,790
move out of the way watch my head that
starts here along goes around body body

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:35,800
starts here along goes around body body
 

39
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:48,469
starts here along goes around body body
moves inhale exhale okay let's try that

40
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479

 

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,550

so let's look at this in terms of

42
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
so let's look at this in terms of
 

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,710
so let's look at this in terms of
architecture so you're you're seen a

44
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:55,720
architecture so you're you're seen a
 

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,680
architecture so you're you're seen a
kind of topsy-turvy effect on his body

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:58,690
kind of topsy-turvy effect on his body
 

47
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,940
kind of topsy-turvy effect on his body
right right okay so you're thinking spin

48
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:02,950
right right okay so you're thinking spin
 

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,460
right right okay so you're thinking spin
the propeller boom right

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,470
the propeller boom right
 

51
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,910
the propeller boom right
oh you're thinking pull him see that

52
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
oh you're thinking pull him see that
 

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,140
oh you're thinking pull him see that
those all require muscle why not let him

54
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,150
those all require muscle why not let him
 

55
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,060
those all require muscle why not let him
fall into that spot so here you go

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,070
fall into that spot so here you go
 

57
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,990
fall into that spot so here you go
you're cutting this or you're pulling

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,000
you're cutting this or you're pulling
 

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,720
you're cutting this or you're pulling
this and what you want to do instead is

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:27,730
this and what you want to do instead is
 

61
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,590
this and what you want to do instead is
just let him fall into that spot so some

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:31,600
just let him fall into that spot so some
 

63
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,840
just let him fall into that spot so some
of you are just way off because you're

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:33,850
of you are just way off because you're
 

65
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,729
of you are just way off because you're
cutting like this and that will not

66
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:35,739
cutting like this and that will not
 

67
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,900
cutting like this and that will not
translate into a ballistic parry the

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:39,910
translate into a ballistic parry the
 

69
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,760
translate into a ballistic parry the
kind of movie

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:40,770
kind of movie
 

71
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,550
kind of movie
formalistic as he throws a strike you're

72
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
formalistic as he throws a strike you're
 

73
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,100
formalistic as he throws a strike you're
going like that and that's not Aikido

74
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,110
going like that and that's not Aikido
 

75
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,650
going like that and that's not Aikido
then some of you are like okay I got

76
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:48,660
then some of you are like okay I got
 

77
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,780
then some of you are like okay I got
here and then you go I don't trust this

78
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:52,790
here and then you go I don't trust this
 

79
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,220
here and then you go I don't trust this
[Music]

80
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
[Music]
 

81
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,050
[Music]
and then now your performance envelope

82
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,060
and then now your performance envelope
 

83
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,110
and then now your performance envelope
goes down so instead once you get here

84
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
goes down so instead once you get here
 

85
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,820
goes down so instead once you get here
trust trust you're not doing anything

86
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:09,830

 

87
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,090

so martially right when I'm not pulling

88
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,100
so martially right when I'm not pulling
 

89
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,950
so martially right when I'm not pulling
him ooh I'm free to hit when I'm pulling

90
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:21,960
him ooh I'm free to hit when I'm pulling
 

91
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,680
him ooh I'm free to hit when I'm pulling
him you're checking yourself out at the

92
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,690
him you're checking yourself out at the
 

93
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,100
him you're checking yourself out at the
same time so here I got my angle

94
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,110
same time so here I got my angle
 

95
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,220
same time so here I got my angle
disturbance do you understand that's all

96
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,230
disturbance do you understand that's all
 

97
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,970
disturbance do you understand that's all
I want

98
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:31,980
I want
 

99
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,500
I want
boom I'm going to knock them I don't

100
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,510
boom I'm going to knock them I don't
 

101
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,200
boom I'm going to knock them I don't
care how he falls you understand you're

102
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,210
care how he falls you understand you're
 

103
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,110
care how he falls you understand you're
prioritizing Aikido like aesthetics

104
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
prioritizing Aikido like aesthetics
 

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,350
prioritizing Aikido like aesthetics
aesthetics you just knock the hell out

106
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,360
aesthetics you just knock the hell out
 

107
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,560
aesthetics you just knock the hell out
of them okay so you get tri your annual

108
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,570
of them okay so you get tri your annual
 

109
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,460
of them okay so you get tri your annual
disturbance and let it do its stay you

110
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
disturbance and let it do its stay you
 

111
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,060
disturbance and let it do its stay you
can see how relaxed don't go here and

112
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,070
can see how relaxed don't go here and
 

113
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:02,970
can see how relaxed don't go here and
then we'll get you very relaxed

114
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:02,980

 

115
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,730

so if you see there's none of this you

116
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:05,740
so if you see there's none of this you
 

117
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,740
so if you see there's none of this you
see none of this I'm not going for my

118
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750
see none of this I'm not going for my
 

119
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:17,400
see none of this I'm not going for my
right to my left that hand went up right

120
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,410

 

121
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:26,999

this way around it yeah

122
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:27,009

 

123
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:36,700

different so here's where we're gonna

124
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:36,710
different so here's where we're gonna
 

125
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,110
different so here's where we're gonna
lose a lot more people who can who is

126
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
lose a lot more people who can who is
 

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,559
lose a lot more people who can who is
still afraid it's not going to be able

128
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:44,569
still afraid it's not going to be able
 

129
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,779
still afraid it's not going to be able
to help you in this so we might divide

130
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:46,789
to help you in this so we might divide
 

131
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:52,809
to help you in this so we might divide
up but katate dori is any kind of

132
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:52,819
up but katate dori is any kind of
 

133
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,930
up but katate dori is any kind of
training wheels for the art that's why

134
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:58,940
training wheels for the art that's why
 

135
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,159
training wheels for the art that's why
we spend a lot of time on it you can

136
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:03,169
we spend a lot of time on it you can
 

137
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,950
we spend a lot of time on it you can
learn a lot of the skill sets but

138
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:05,960
learn a lot of the skill sets but
 

139
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,200
learn a lot of the skill sets but
they're a little more distant from all

140
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,210
they're a little more distant from all
 

141
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,680
they're a little more distant from all
the applications okay so we also have

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:11,690
the applications okay so we also have
 

143
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,809
the applications okay so we also have
continuity right and like katate dori

144
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:16,819
continuity right and like katate dori
 

145
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,770
continuity right and like katate dori
it's a fixated movement and I use my

146
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:20,780
it's a fixated movement and I use my
 

147
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,959
it's a fixated movement and I use my
fixated movements to help me get to my

148
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:22,969
fixated movements to help me get to my
 

149
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,080
fixated movements to help me get to my
ballistics

150
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,090
ballistics
 

151
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,320
ballistics
so the ballistic equivalent of

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,330
so the ballistic equivalent of
 

153
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,570
so the ballistic equivalent of
continuity continuity shoulder drop is

154
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,580
continuity continuity shoulder drop is
 

155
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,600
continuity continuity shoulder drop is
yokomenuchi Oh boom okay or any

156
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:36,610
yokomenuchi Oh boom okay or any
 

157
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,719
yokomenuchi Oh boom okay or any
ballistic strike coming on a horizontal

158
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:40,729
ballistic strike coming on a horizontal
 

159
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,999
ballistic strike coming on a horizontal
plane you understand so katate dori is

160
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:46,009
plane you understand so katate dori is
 

161
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,390
plane you understand so katate dori is
kind of the master of fixated

162
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
kind of the master of fixated
 

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,290
kind of the master of fixated
