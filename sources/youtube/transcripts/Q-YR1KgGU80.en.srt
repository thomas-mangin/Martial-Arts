this
 

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,429
this
way so it's in harmony with him W then

26
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
way so it's in harmony with him W then
 

27
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,230
way so it's in harmony with him W then
you need that angle of cancellation so

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
you need that angle of cancellation so
 

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,109
you need that angle of cancellation so
this elbow has to be in can't be

30
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:50,119
this elbow has to be in can't be
 

31
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,149
this elbow has to be in can't be
down that's what you're trying for and

down that's what you're trying for and
 

33
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,069
down that's what you're trying for and
then you clear the line so he's coming

34
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
then you clear the line so he's coming
 

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,830
then you clear the line so he's coming
he's coming in and you're going this way

55
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,790

try okay so you see his energy lifts the

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:39,800
try okay so you see his energy lifts the
 

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,030
try okay so you see his energy lifts the
sword I don't I don't lift it okay then

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
sword I don't I don't lift it okay then
 

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,630
sword I don't I don't lift it okay then
I move underneath

there I will do the rest with my
base as I monitor how much I need and

80
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
base as I monitor how much I need and
 

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,229
base as I monitor how much I need and
can have to keep him here so what I

that I'm just kind of monitoring for the
 

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,750
that I'm just kind of monitoring for the
tilt there I feel his resistance that's

90
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:32,760
tilt there I feel his resistance that's
 

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,990
tilt there I feel his resistance that's
all I get so I come

he'll slide down

106
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,000
he'll slide down
 

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,670
he'll slide down
it I got to get rid of

108
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
it I got to get rid of
 

109
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:19,310
it I got to get rid of
him I'm projected my head long boom

110
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,320

 

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:28,590

tilt okay let's

112
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600

 

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:39,670

try

114
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680

 

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,430

so I know at the end my my B is going

116
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,440
so I know at the end my my B is going
 

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,029
so I know at the end my my B is going
over here but it's cuz he's falling and

118
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,039
over here but it's cuz he's falling and
 

119
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,110
over here but it's cuz he's falling and
then he lets go but you should be able

120
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
then he lets go but you should be able
 

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,029
then he lets go but you should be able
to tell that my arm is relaxed and it's

122
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:50,039
to tell that my arm is relaxed and it's
 

123
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,070
to tell that my arm is relaxed and it's
not cutting it down I think if you can't

124
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
not cutting it down I think if you can't
 

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,230
not cutting it down I think if you can't
tell that there's no tension in the body

126
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,240
tell that there's no tension in the body
 

127
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,230
tell that there's no tension in the body
you just haven't trained long enough to

128
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
you just haven't trained long enough to
 

129
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,710
you just haven't trained long enough to
you can't even tell that you got to be

130
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
you can't even tell that you got to be
 

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,749
you can't even tell that you got to be
able to tell that okay so there's a I'm

132
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
able to tell that okay so there's a I'm
 

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,629
able to tell that okay so there's a I'm
not pulling down on

134
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:03,639
not pulling down on
 

135
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,790
not pulling down on
him the first part that I have to get

136
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:07,800
him the first part that I have to get
 

137
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,390
him the first part that I have to get
him to get more tilt is that I'm come to

138
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,400
him to get more tilt is that I'm come to
 

139
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,270
him to get more tilt is that I'm come to
the

140
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280

 

141
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,150

front is the the initial connection with

142
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
front is the the initial connection with
 

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,550
front is the the initial connection with
the elbow so when the sword goes up you

144
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,560
the elbow so when the sword goes up you
 

145
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,950
the elbow so when the sword goes up you
see what it's doing to his elbow if I

146
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:21,960
see what it's doing to his elbow if I
 

147
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,550
see what it's doing to his elbow if I
can get his elbow vertical then he'll

148
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
can get his elbow vertical then he'll
 

149
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,189
can get his elbow vertical then he'll
have more back to him you see do you

150
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
have more back to him you see do you
 

151
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,350
have more back to him you see do you
guys get that

152
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,360

 

153
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,550

so you can't you can't have that be dead

154
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
so you can't you can't have that be dead
 

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,270
so you can't you can't have that be dead
I am doing that but it's on it's on the

156
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
I am doing that but it's on it's on the
 

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,830
I am doing that but it's on it's on the
up so if I enter over here I won't be

158
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
up so if I enter over here I won't be
 

159
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,390
up so if I enter over here I won't be
able to affect the elbow here's his

160
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
able to affect the elbow here's his
 

161
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,950
able to affect the elbow here's his
elbow so on him right now I have to

162
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:43,960
elbow so on him right now I have to
 

163
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,390
elbow so on him right now I have to
enter there and as I lift the sword up I

164
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
enter there and as I lift the sword up I
 

165
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,909
enter there and as I lift the sword up I
make sure I keep that elbow going up and

166
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
make sure I keep that elbow going up and
 

167
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,909
make sure I keep that elbow going up and
