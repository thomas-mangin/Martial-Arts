1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,245
Now for this one I'm going to show you how\h
to wear the hakama.

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,299
This is not the "traditional" way.\h\h

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:19,386
It's not like there is any "traditional" way to\hbe honest, when you think about the history of the thing and the way we wear it with a judo\hkeikogi.

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,080
So I'm going to show you my way to wear it,

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,141
which i find both easy and convenient.

6
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:27,827
So you take it\hfrom the front, like this, and the first thing you,

7
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,400
is that of course, you step one leg at the time\hin the hakama.

8
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,067
So one leg, and the other leg.

9
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:41,277
Then, you place the hakama like this.

10
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:44,044
Place your belt\hunder the bone of your hips like this.

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,322
It should be way below your belly button, under the bones\h
of your hips.

12
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:54,495
That's for males by the way. Females may wear it differently but obviously\hI'm showing it to you to you the way I wear it.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,720
OK, so the belt is kind of going a bit down\hlike this, a little bit higher above your buttocks.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,400
If you've got a belly of course it starts to fall\hnaturally down so that's good.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,710
But even if you\h\hdon't have a belly make sure you have that sort of that shape.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,797
Then you take the hakama front like this\hand you place it right above the belt.

17
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,615
Here.

18
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:23,286
So that\hpart here, which is the front strap of the hakama falls\hright above your obi, your belt here.

19
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:26,827
Then you're\hgoing to wrap it around above your belt.

20
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:31,944
At the back,\hyou're going to cross here you cross here,

21
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:35,440
which makes the straps of the hakama end up\hunder your belt.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,105
You make them all go all\hthe way around like this.

23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:45,227
What I like to do\h\his to make sure that my obi, 

24
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:48,453
that I showed\hyou how to tie in the previous video,

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,259
stays on top like this.

26
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,434
Again not necessarily\h"traditional" or anything...

27
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,647
Don't look\h\hfor too much meaning inside that because there is\h
none, actually.

28
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:59,764
It's just the way that I prefer\hto do it.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,747
So those two straps from the belt are\habove like this.

30
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,747
This is at the front like this\h\h

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,066
And then you're going to make one first knot\hunder the obi, here.

32
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,832
Like this, under the obi.\h

33
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:19,015
Tie it, and go around.

34
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:23,440
When you go around,\hit still stays under the belt like this.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,946
You go around under.

36
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,422
And then when you're\hdone you make a knot like this.

37
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,760
One,

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,646
and you make one more at the top here,

39
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,471
two, just\ha simple knot two simple knots, like this.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,384
What I like to do when I'm done with this,

41
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:45,684
I like to place those straps, to roll them inside here.

42
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,928
Over there, one, and two.

43
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,983
Not under the belt but under the\hstraps of the hakama.

44
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:55,742
So here it's nice and\htight.

45
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,597
Then I'm going to take the back,

46
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:01,363
lift up the back like this.

47
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:06,429
Place the koshiita, here on the back, at the top of the belt.

48
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,927
Here, like so.

49
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:12,927
And then I'm gonna send\hthis inside the belt.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,426
So i'm gonna grab inside the\hbelt... 

51
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:24,189
You can actually stand it also under those\hstraps here if you prefer.

52
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,299
It doesn't matter which\hone you do.

53
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,861
So I'll place it under the straps here.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,511
Other the side, same, over here. 

55
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:39,702
And then this\his going to fall under the whole\hbelt, here.

56
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:45,336
So you're going to be making your\hknot here, under this one

57
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,216
So here is your\hbelt here, 

58
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,920
Belt,

59
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,935
the first knot that we did with the\hhakama here,

60
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,702
the second knot goes under.

61
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,703
One knot,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,968
a second knot on top, to tighten it.

63
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,377
OK.

64
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:09,250
Tighten this and then just roll them in the\h\hhakama straps like you did before with\hthe other strap ends.

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,480
Here, it's nice and tight.

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,427
You can practice, it's not going to go down and it's\hnot going to going to open,

67
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:20,499
because you've made\h\hsure that you tied it twice like this.

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,573
It's kind of flat like this so it looks okay.

69
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,977
I'm not doing the sort of a butterfly, "traditional" knot,

70
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:33,044
on purpose because I find this is more\hresilient when you practice,

71
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,658
and\hit's also also quicker to do.
