1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,510

okay there there are a couple things

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:02,520
okay there there are a couple things
 

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,389
okay there there are a couple things
we're working on here uh one he go he's

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
we're working on here uh one he go he's
 

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,950
we're working on here uh one he go he's
going okay it's just he he's just

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
going okay it's just he he's just
 

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,789
going okay it's just he he's just
representing linear assault okay the the

8
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
representing linear assault okay the the
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,829
representing linear assault okay the the
first one is that I have to create get

10
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
first one is that I have to create get
 

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,109
first one is that I have to create get
out of weapon retention issue range okay

12
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:20,119
out of weapon retention issue range okay
 

13
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,109
out of weapon retention issue range okay
so I'm going to move away from him so my

14
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
so I'm going to move away from him so my
 

15
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,710
so I'm going to move away from him so my
angle of deviation goes opposite my

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
angle of deviation goes opposite my
 

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,509
angle of deviation goes opposite my
angle deflection so that I can start to

18
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
angle deflection so that I can start to
 

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,549
angle deflection so that I can start to
generate room to draw the

20
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559

 

21
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,670

00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:44,039
this fight around so you have your iido
 

27
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,510
this fight around so you have your iido
spiraling uh footwork so I'm going to

28
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,520
spiraling uh footwork so I'm going to
 

29
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,270
spiraling uh footwork so I'm going to
spiral this fight around okay so I'm

30
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
spiral this fight around okay so I'm
 

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,590
spiral this fight around okay so I'm
turning now he has to turn to get me

32
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
turning now he has to turn to get me
 

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,470
turning now he has to turn to get me
okay that's what you

34
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480

 

35
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270

want and then thirdly I'm I'm going to

want and then thirdly I'm I'm going to
 

37
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,990
want and then thirdly I'm I'm going to
connect to his Center so that I get that

38
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
connect to his Center so that I get that
 

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,990

little
micro uh projection as we're going so

42
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
micro uh projection as we're going so
 

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,350
micro uh projection as we're going so
here as we go slow boom I have I'm going

44
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,360
here as we go slow boom I have I'm going
 

45
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,670
here as we go slow boom I have I'm going
to project into his body because of this

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,680
to project into his body because of this
 

47
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,469
to project into his body because of this
joint so just like if I was below his

48
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
joint so just like if I was below his
 

49
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,710

Ahad stick your arms just like I was

50
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
Ahad stick your arms just like I was
 

51
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,990
Ahad stick your arms just like I was
below you can put that one just as I was

52
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,000
below you can put that one just as I was
 

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,870
below you can put that one just as I was
below the elbow That Elbow will hinge so

54
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:25,880
below the elbow That Elbow will hinge so
 

55
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,990
below the elbow That Elbow will hinge so
you smack that hard you might not get

56
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
you smack that hard you might not get
 

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,350
you smack that hard you might not get
the angle deviation in here that you

58
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360
the angle deviation in here that you
 

59
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,469
the angle deviation in here that you
want and same thing here the the

60
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
want and same thing here the the
 

61
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,190
want and same thing here the the
shoulder can hinge and you'll lose some

62
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
shoulder can hinge and you'll lose some
 

63
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,789
shoulder can hinge and you'll lose some
of that so when you come above the elbow

64
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
of that so when you come above the elbow
 

65
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,389
of that so when you come above the elbow
boom it's got to be in his Center

because of the inertia he's not going to

68
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
because of the inertia he's not going to
 

69
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,230
because of the inertia he's not going to
go that way he's still probably going to

70
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,240
go that way he's still probably going to
 

71
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,350
go that way he's still probably going to
go somewhere south of the 180 here but

72
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
go somewhere south of the 180 here but
 

73
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,469
go somewhere south of the 180 here but
he's definitely going to go that way and

74
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
he's definitely going to go that way and
 

75
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,429
he's definitely going to go that way and
that helps accomplish what I'm trying to

76
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
that helps accomplish what I'm trying to
 

77
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,910
that helps accomplish what I'm trying to
do in the other two things all right and

do in the other two things all right and
 

79
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,389
do in the other two things all right and
then the fourth thing is you can't be

80
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
then the fourth thing is you can't be
 

81
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,310
then the fourth thing is you can't be

faster if you pay attention on that that
 

121
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,990
faster if you pay attention on that that
second aspect the projection I don't

122
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
second aspect the projection I don't
 

123
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,430
second aspect the projection I don't
extend my

124
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,440
extend my
 

125
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,910

on this one we'll move away from the
 

139
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,789
on this one we'll move away from the
abstraction and someone's trying to get

140
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
abstraction and someone's trying to get

147
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,110
boom you have a lot of stuff that you
can do with that from that bicep TI and

148
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
can do with that from that bicep TI and
 

149
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,990
can do with that from that bicep TI and
the clinch okay so he's trying to do the

150
