1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,830

let's try that when I do the strike I

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
let's try that when I do the strike I
 

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,930
let's try that when I do the strike I
want all my organization on that okay so

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:08,940
want all my organization on that okay so
 

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,230
want all my organization on that okay so
like everything is hitting there when I

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
like everything is hitting there when I
 

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,160
like everything is hitting there when I
do this point now to do that what block

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,170
do this point now to do that what block
 

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,529
do this point now to do that what block
would be force on force that's a clash

10
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:18,539
would be force on force that's a clash
 

11
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,609
would be force on force that's a clash
okay so I need to go in this case what I

12
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:22,619
okay so I need to go in this case what I
 

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,980
okay so I need to go in this case what I
did was going under it so that means

14
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:24,990
did was going under it so that means
 

15
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,700
did was going under it so that means
that my Center has to draw my Center has

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:28,710
that my Center has to draw my Center has
 

17
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,890
that my Center has to draw my Center has
to draw my Center does not keep turning

18
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:30,900
to draw my Center does not keep turning
 

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,090
to draw my Center does not keep turning
in you see so I was going in felt it and

20
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,100
in you see so I was going in felt it and
 

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,910
in you see so I was going in felt it and
underneath it so if you just look here

22
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
underneath it so if you just look here
 

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,950
underneath it so if you just look here
you keep looking at my hand you want to

24
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:39,960
you keep looking at my hand you want to
 

25
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,840
you keep looking at my hand you want to
look here today so I here's the strike

26
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:46,850

 

27
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,139

and no one can do it okay so that's not

28
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:51,149
and no one can do it okay so that's not
 

29
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,910
and no one can do it okay so that's not
what's happening in fact what is

30
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
what's happening in fact what is
 

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,549
what's happening in fact what is
happening is what I mentioned the other

day where you you have to have both the
 

35
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,709
day where you you have to have both the
capacity for concentration and a

36
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:03,719
capacity for concentration and a
 

37
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,200
capacity for concentration and a
capacity for detachment so which means

38
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,210
capacity for detachment so which means
 

39
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,429
capacity for detachment so which means
unattach me detach me okay so I'm doing

going to be what I wanted it to be then
 

49
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,350
going to be what I wanted it to be then

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
immediately I have detached from that
 

51
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,670

you don't know which is why some of you
stopped throwing the strikes and just

56
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:31,740
stopped throwing the strikes and just
 

57
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,060

you have variations on that explanation

78
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:03,189
you have variations on that explanation
 

79
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,240
you have variations on that explanation
so you know what the good good with it

80
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,250
so you know what the good good with it
 

81

what tiny bit a little bit Mitchell

86
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,110
what tiny bit a little bit Mitchell
 

87
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,020
what tiny bit a little bit Mitchell
you'll see you give it off so I feel I

88
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,030
you'll see you give it off so I feel I
 

89
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,580
you'll see you give it off so I feel I
think that's now you're trying to make

90
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,590
think that's now you're trying to make
 

91
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,860
think that's now you're trying to make
the metaphor we'll just understand it's

92
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:22,870
the metaphor we'll just understand it's
 

93
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,410
the metaphor we'll just understand it's
about full concentration and then as

94
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,420
about full concentration and then as
 

95
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,160
about full concentration and then as
needed a full detachment full unattach

96
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,170

 

97
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,390

[Music]

98
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,400

 

99
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,440

I think yeah as a beginner technique I

100
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,450
I think yeah as a beginner technique I
 

101
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,289
I think yeah as a beginner technique I
don't think that is the way that you

102
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:44,299
don't think that is the way that you
 

103
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:47,470
don't think that is the way that you
actually cultivate this skill I do think

104
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
actually cultivate this skill I do think
 

105
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,020
actually cultivate this skill I do think
that that is the way that you begin to

106
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,030
that that is the way that you begin to
 

107
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,759
that that is the way that you begin to
problematize the fact that I can't do it

108
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:54,769
problematize the fact that I can't do it
 

109
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,339
problematize the fact that I can't do it
at all because most of us are totally

110
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:57,349
at all because most of us are totally
 

111
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,970
at all because most of us are totally
unaware that we stop the hand right or

112
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:00,980
unaware that we stop the hand right or
 

113
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,649
unaware that we stop the hand right or
that we're on the bottom and not on the

114
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:02,659
that we're on the bottom and not on the
 

115
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,190
that we're on the bottom and not on the
top so by slowing it down so that your

116
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,200
top so by slowing it down so that your
 

117
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,770

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:08,780
your intellect can take note of and
 

119
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,589
your intellect can take note of and
observe right yet that's like the first

120
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
observe right yet that's like the first
 

121
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:14,810
step towards a different you but as far
 

123
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,270

call that's an original religious

130
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
call that's an original religious

relight realization that's a spiritual
maturity that has to happen and so you

134
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,250
maturity that has to happen and so you
 

135
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,789
maturity that has to happen and so you
need to cultivate it through those means

136
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:33,799
need to cultivate it through those means
 

137
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,660
need to cultivate it through those means
that's going to be service that's going

ignorance all of that that has that's
 

149
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,039
ignorance all of that that has that's
how you do it so you take your practice

150
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,049
how you do it so you take your practice
 

151
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,280
how you do it so you take your practice
and you make it an attempt to purify out

152
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,290
and you make it an attempt to purify out
 

153
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,890
and you make it an attempt to purify out
or to reconcile fear pride ignorance

or to reconcile fear pride ignorance
then this mind will follow and you

156
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:05,569
then this mind will follow and you
 

157
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,460
then this mind will follow and you
cannot do that just by observing

158
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,470
cannot do that just by observing
 

159
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,129
cannot do that just by observing
yourself in the technique you can kind

160
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:12,139
yourself in the technique you can kind
 

161
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,979
yourself in the technique you can kind
of lead that in like we say you can use

162
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:14,989
