um we already know there's like

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:08,920
um we already know there's like
 

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,070
um we already know there's like
progressions in

8
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,080
progressions in
 

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,549
progressions in
training um one has to allow for the

10
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:15,559
training um one has to allow for the
 

11
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,830
training um one has to allow for the
difference between when one is talking

12
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:18,840
difference between when one is talking
 

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,310
difference between when one is talking
about what is the

14
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,320
about what is the
 

15
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,470
about what is the
ideal and then what is the actual

16
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
ideal and then what is the actual
 

17
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,589
ideal and then what is the actual
learning curves you're dealing with

18
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
learning curves you're dealing with
 

19
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,910
learning curves you're dealing with
okay and I think anybody who understands

20
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:30,920
okay and I think anybody who understands
 

21
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,069
okay and I think anybody who understands
any kind of training knows that there's

22
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:33,079
any kind of training knows that there's
 

23
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,630
any kind of training knows that there's
a difference there is where we should be

24
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,640
a difference there is where we should be
 

25
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,590
a difference there is where we should be
and then the reality of where we are

26
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
and then the reality of where we are
 

27
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,910
and then the reality of where we are
okay and they don't contradict each

28
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
okay and they don't contradict each
 

29
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:54,069
okay and they don't contradict each
other they're just different

30
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079

 

31
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,349

because some of you are too ill to to
 

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,230
because some of you are too ill to to
ever get to the ideal and so you need

38
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
ever get to the ideal and so you need
 

39

that because training at the ideal level

92
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:32,599
that because training at the ideal level
 

93
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,309
that because training at the ideal level
is going to assume that you're not over

94

is going to assume that you're not over

agitated you just can't do it it's not
 

97
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,670
agitated you just can't do it it's not
possible but as a learning curve we come

98
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
possible but as a learning curve we come
 

99
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,149
possible but as a learning curve we come
to training

100
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,159
to training
 

101
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,750
to training
with

102
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
with
 

103
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,550
with
agitation

104
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
agitation
 

105
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,430
agitation
okay it's no different than training

106
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
okay it's no different than training
 

107
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,790
okay it's no different than training
requires a certain level of mobility and

108
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
requires a certain level of mobility and
 

109
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,830
requires a certain level of mobility and
a certain level of strength so um we're

110
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840
a certain level of strength so um we're
 

111
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,589
a certain level of strength so um we're
going to have to lift weights cuz you're

112
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
going to have to lift weights cuz you're
 

113
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,949
going to have to lift weights cuz you're
a weak

114
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
a weak
 

115
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,390
a weak
stiffy right we have to do we have to do

116
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
stiffy right we have to do we have to do
 

117
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,830
stiffy right we have to do we have to do
that we have to in a way prepare

118
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:10,840
that we have to in a way prepare
 

119
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,350
that we have to in a way prepare
ourselves to one day train and the

120
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,360
ourselves to one day train and the
 

121
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,550
ourselves to one day train and the
biggest mistake is we don't think we

122
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
biggest mistake is we don't think we
 

123
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,910
biggest mistake is we don't think we
have to we think we're

124
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:18,920
have to we think we're
 

125
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,149
have to we think we're
training because we're lifting weights

126
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:21,159
training because we're lifting weights
 

127
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,190
training because we're lifting weights
we're not you're just you're weak it's

128
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,200
we're not you're just you're weak it's
 

129
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,470
we're not you're just you're weak it's
why we're lifting

130
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480

 

131
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,030

weights like in the last tech in the

132
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
weights like in the last tech in the
 

133
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,190
weights like in the last tech in the
techniques we did today there's a

134
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
techniques we did today there's a
 

135
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,270
techniques we did today there's a
certain level of suppleness and a

136
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
certain level of suppleness and a
 

137
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,149
certain level of suppleness and a
certain level of strength that's just

138
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
certain level of strength that's just
 

139
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,350
certain level of strength that's just
assumed even in the reconciliation of

140
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,360
assumed even in the reconciliation of
 

141
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,750
assumed even in the reconciliation of
Yin and

142
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
Yin and
 

143
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,190
Yin and
Yang you you have to have a certain

144
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,200
Yang you you have to have a certain
 

145
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,110
Yang you you have to have a certain
level of strength and uh some of you

146
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,120
level of strength and uh some of you
 

147
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,670
level of strength and uh some of you
don't have it and there's no way you're

148
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
don't have it and there's no way you're
 

149
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,390
don't have it and there's no way you're
going to pick this person up to balance

150
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
going to pick this person up to balance
 

151
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,589
going to pick this person up to balance
them on your chest there's just no way

so event and these are ancient systems

so event and these are ancient systems
 

421
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,710
so event and these are ancient systems
of the body so even for example if my

422
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
of the body so even for example if my
 

423
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,150

your heart is connected to your kidney

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,870
your heart is connected to your kidney
system it's part of that and so you you

428
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
system it's part of that and so you you
 

429
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,350
system it's part of that and so you you
have you have to expand what you what

that is all this okay all right so we
 

517
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,310
that is all this okay all right so we
have to bring down this Yi we have to in

let's uh stand
 

527
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,030
let's uh stand
up and as I said you do this in every

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,040
up and as I said you do this in every
 

529
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,069
up and as I said you do this in every
single iido

530
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
single iido
 

531
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,350

technique just what you do okay so in

532
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
technique just what you do okay so in
 

533
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,910
technique just what you do okay so in
the first class and the ne was a class

534
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
the first class and the ne was a class
 

535
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,269
the first class and the ne was a class
you were doing you had to have done it

536
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:04,279
you were doing you had to have done it
 

537
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,389
you were doing you had to have done it
to get the guy up to your chest there's

538
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
to get the guy up to your chest there's
 

539
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,189
to get the guy up to your chest there's
just absolutely no way as you could see

540
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
just absolutely no way as you could see
 

541
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,949
just absolutely no way as you could see
we had people that had no chance of

542
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
we had people that had no chance of
 

543
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,829
we had people that had no chance of
getting that person up to the chest

544
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:12,839
getting that person up to the chest
 

545
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,870
getting that person up to the chest
versus those that could get up get that

546
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
versus those that could get up get that
 

547
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,990
versus those that could get up get that
mass up to the chest it was effortless

548
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,000
mass up to the chest it was effortless
 

549
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,389
mass up to the chest it was effortless
right it was effortless oh but to others

550
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
right it was effortless oh but to others
 

551
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,870
right it was effortless oh but to others
seemed impossible okay all right so

552
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:25,880
seemed impossible okay all right so
 

553
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,710
seemed impossible okay all right so
basically you start with the standing

554
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:29,720
basically you start with the standing
 

555
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,629
basically you start with the standing
drill of the I and C you set okay so get

556
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
drill of the I and C you set okay so get
 

557
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,430
drill of the I and C you set okay so get
your

558
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
your
 

559
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,269
your
feet under your

560
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279
feet under your
 

561
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,949
feet under your
hips shift your

562
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:41,959

 

563
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,110

weight to your midfoot vector on the

564
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
weight to your midfoot vector on the
 

565
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
weight to your midfoot vector on the
midfoot

566
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
midfoot
 

567
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,629
midfoot
okay and first you have to release the

568
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:49,639
okay and first you have to release the
 

569
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,550
okay and first you have to release the
tension now some can't do this standing

570
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
tension now some can't do this standing
 

571
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,590
tension now some can't do this standing
they just

572
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
they just
 

573
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,629
they just
can't and so we have the laying down

574
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
can't and so we have the laying down
 

575
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,550
can't and so we have the laying down
corpse pose but that is is just a drill

576
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560
corpse pose but that is is just a drill
 

577
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,189
corpse pose but that is is just a drill
that you can release muscle tension

578
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,199
that you can release muscle tension
 

579
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,910
that you can release muscle tension
on that it does not work as well for

580
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
on that it does not work as well for
 

581
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,670
on that it does not work as well for
allowing the heaven aspect to lower do

582
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:12,680
allowing the heaven aspect to lower do
 

583
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,189
allowing the heaven aspect to lower do
you get that because it lowers down your

584
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:16,199
you get that because it lowers down your
 

585
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,470
you get that because it lowers down your
spine it does not lower perpendicular to

586
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,480
spine it does not lower perpendicular to
 

587
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,150
spine it does not lower perpendicular to
the Earth so when you're laying

588
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
the Earth so when you're laying
 

589
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,389
the Earth so when you're laying
down it's harder to allow for gravity

590
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
down it's harder to allow for gravity
 

591
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,189
down it's harder to allow for gravity
and the natural center of gravity to

592
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
and the natural center of gravity to
 

593
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,269
and the natural center of gravity to
pull or tug on this Heaven Chi or this

594
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:32,279
pull or tug on this Heaven Chi or this
 

595
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,189
pull or tug on this Heaven Chi or this
Heaven aspect okay but you might I'm

596
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
Heaven aspect okay but you might I'm
 

597
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,870
Heaven aspect okay but you might I'm
just so tense okay lay down and work on

598
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
just so tense okay lay down and work on
 

599
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,230
just so tense okay lay down and work on
releasing muscle tension okay and that

600
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,240
releasing muscle tension okay and that
 

601
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,189
releasing muscle tension okay and that
is assumed in this skill so I start to

602
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
is assumed in this skill so I start to
 

603
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,110
is assumed in this skill so I start to
drop if we remember these

604
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,120
drop if we remember these
 

605
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,670
drop if we remember these
drills okay I start scanning first for

606
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,680
drills okay I start scanning first for
 

607
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,790
drills okay I start scanning first for
all my

all my
 

609
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,590
all my
tension as I'm doing this I should feel

610
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,600
tension as I'm doing this I should feel
 

611
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,910
tension as I'm doing this I should feel
my shoulders

612
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
my shoulders
 

613
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,829

release I should feel this sternum
 

617
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,030
release I should feel this sternum
drop once I feel it

618
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,040
drop once I feel it
 

619
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,150

uh you're going to have to address the
 

861
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,110
uh you're going to have to address the
Mind aspects of that stiffness and this

862
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
Mind aspects of that stiffness and this
 

863
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,269
Mind aspects of that stiffness and this
is how you address the Mind aspect of

864
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:05,279
is how you address the Mind aspect of
 

865
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,470
is how you address the Mind aspect of
that stiffness so you should be doing

866
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:07,480
that stiffness so you should be doing
 

867
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,269
that stiffness so you should be doing
this Dr I'm not going to sit here and

00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:09,279
this Dr I'm not going to sit here and
 

869
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,350
