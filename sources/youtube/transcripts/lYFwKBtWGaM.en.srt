so that's subtle in itself what i need

10
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
so that's subtle in itself what i need
 

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,630
so that's subtle in itself what i need
is what i need is his arm to be in

12
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
is what i need is his arm to be in
 

13
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,470

what's known as the unbendable arm

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
what's known as the unbendable arm
 

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,990
what's known as the unbendable arm
position

16
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000

 

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,750

now

18
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
now
 

19
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,350
now
i can move him with one unit

20
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360

 

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,950

if i'm going to do the hand version

22
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960

 

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,950

there's two ways of doing it one is with

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
there's two ways of doing it one is with
 

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,350
there's two ways of doing it one is with
the thumb

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
the thumb
 

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,670
the thumb
where you keep it rotating out

28
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680

 

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,270

and keep rotating this down down

30
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
and keep rotating this down down
 

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:05,109
and keep rotating this down down
it saves you putting power on here

32
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119

 

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,310

i need this

34
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320

 

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,910

don't let it come back i go to that

36
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
