00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,110

so I want to explain some things about

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
so I want to explain some things about

so I want to explain some things about
uh B okay so she's pushing cuz she has

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,440
uh B okay so she's pushing cuz she has
 

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,270
uh B okay so she's pushing cuz she has
to have the spinal

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,280

 

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,910

displacement right so I'm going to yield

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
displacement right so I'm going to yield
 

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,589
displacement right so I'm going to yield
and she's going to hit the ground here

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:22,599

 

11
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:27,269

see I'm trying not to go like

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279

 

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,950

this just yield

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:33,960

 

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,790

any number of ways it doesn't matter you

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:35,800
any number of ways it doesn't matter you
 

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,150
any number of ways it doesn't matter you
can do your hand this way but she HS she

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
can do your hand this way but she HS she
 

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,229
can do your hand this way but she HS she
hits that you see the shape's not

20
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:41,239
hits that you see the shape's not
 

21
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,110
hits that you see the shape's not
important I just like this extra

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120

 

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,790

yield then

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800

 

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,470

secondarily there's a yield right here

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,480
secondarily there's a yield right here
 

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,189
secondarily there's a yield right here
you see there's not a push turn into it

28
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,199
you see there's not a push turn into it
 

29
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,750
you see there's not a push turn into it
meing because for Ura she had to be

30
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
meing because for Ura she had to be
 

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,789
meing because for Ura she had to be
pushing right so there has to be a

32
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
pushing right so there has to be a
 

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,749
pushing right so there has to be a
yield yield right there and again don't

34
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:10,759
yield yield right there and again don't
 

35
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,469
yield yield right there and again don't
confuse it with stepping back it's not a

36
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:13,479
confuse it with stepping back it's not a
 

37
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,590
confuse it with stepping back it's not a
matter of stepping back I can step in

38
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600

resistance so you're going to musle it
 

147
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,350
resistance so you're going to musle it
and then start to take it off like

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,270
going y against her y That's how you
muscle it okay so as I I go when you if

154
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
muscle it okay so as I I go when you if
 

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,590
muscle it okay so as I I go when you if
you if that was the projection line you

156
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
you if that was the projection line you
 

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,150
you if that was the projection line you
see and I keep lifting up on that line

158
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
see and I keep lifting up on that line
 

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,430

it's ever so much ever so much and what
 

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,029
it's ever so much ever so much and what
I want to do is after the projection

166
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,039
I want to do is after the projection
 

167
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,670
I want to do is after the projection
line I yield here you see it goes

168
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:20,680
line I yield here you see it goes
 

169
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,950
line I yield here you see it goes
down that's why you want this softness

170
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:23,960
down that's why you want this softness
 

171
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,469
down that's why you want this softness
long H soft it goes immediately into the

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,230

down you see that difference okay so you

178
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
