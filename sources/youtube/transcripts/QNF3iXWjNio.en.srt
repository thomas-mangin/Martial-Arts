could tell when the when the glutes are
 

495
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,509
could tell when the when the glutes are
are tight because I'm more just pushing

00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
example like I'm trying to explain red
 

535
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,190
example like I'm trying to explain red
to somebody who's not seen it before

536
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,200
to somebody who's not seen it before
 

537
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,029
to somebody who's not seen it before
if we wait if if we could formulate the

538
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
if we wait if if we could formulate the
 

539
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,149
if we wait if if we could formulate the
questions then we know what red is so no

540
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:04,159
questions then we know what red is so no
 

541
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,789
questions then we know what red is so no
that doesn't work you have to just what

542
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
that doesn't work you have to just what
 

543
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,190
that doesn't work you have to just what
feels like

544
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,200
feels like
 

545
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,270
feels like
rambling what do you

546
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,280

 

547
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,389

got I don't know I I you know clearly

548
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
got I don't know I I you know clearly
 

549
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,430
got I don't know I I you know clearly
good guidance because it just I felt in

550
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
good guidance because it just I felt in
 

551
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,710
good guidance because it just I felt in
incoming Force but it just all felt to

552
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
incoming Force but it just all felt to
 

553
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,149
incoming Force but it just all felt to
me like adjustments you

554
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
me like adjustments you
 

555
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,829
me like adjustments you
know definitely like I said some tension

556
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
know definitely like I said some tension
 

557
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,349
know definitely like I said some tension
in the arm but not yes yeah you know not

558
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
in the arm but not yes yeah you know not
 

559
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,069
in the arm but not yes yeah you know not
like you would think for that level of

560
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:39,079
like you would think for that level of
 

561
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,389
like you would think for that level of
press lateral pressure well and that's

562
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:41,399
press lateral pressure well and that's
 

563
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,149
press lateral pressure well and that's
that's part of it too I've got no sense

564
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:43,159
that's part of it too I've got no sense
 

565
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,430
that's part of it too I've got no sense
of which I suppose is the goal no sense

566
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:46,440
of which I suppose is the goal no sense
 

567
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,030
of which I suppose is the goal no sense
of how much Lal pressure feel like much

568
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,040
of how much Lal pressure feel like much
 

569
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,470
of how much Lal pressure feel like much
yeah it doesn't feel like much yeah

570
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
yeah it doesn't feel like much yeah
 

571
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,310
yeah it doesn't feel like much yeah
didn't feel like nothing it didn't feel

572
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,320
didn't feel like nothing it didn't feel
 

573
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,950
didn't feel like nothing it didn't feel
like much yeah and and you when you

574
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:57,960
like much yeah and and you when you
 

575
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,790
like much yeah and and you when you
would

576
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800

 

577
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,069

drop I I like the word pressure because

578
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
drop I I like the word pressure because
 

579
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,550
drop I I like the word pressure because
I do feel pressurized and I feel like

580
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,560
I do feel pressurized and I feel like
 

581
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,950
I do feel pressurized and I feel like
he's he's really deep into the intern

582
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:11,960
he's he's really deep into the intern
 

583
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,670
he's he's really deep into the intern
inside you so if I move he's going to

584
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
inside you so if I move he's going to
 

585
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,150
inside you so if I move he's going to
move if I if I release and yield he's

586
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,160
move if I if I release and yield he's
 

587
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,270
move if I if I release and yield he's
going to come flying in you know what I

588
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
going to come flying in you know what I
 

589
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,109
going to come flying in you know what I
mean you you brought like a balloon that

590
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:24,119
mean you you brought like a balloon that
 

591
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,829
mean you you brought like a balloon that
you squished you see or I like the

592
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
you squished you see or I like the
 

593
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,870
you squished you see or I like the
analogy of the ball the the beach ball

594
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
analogy of the ball the the beach ball
 

595
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,349
analogy of the ball the the beach ball
that you bring under the pool surface

596
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
that you bring under the pool surface
 

597
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,589
that you bring under the pool surface
water that's what it feels like okay it

598
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:36,599
water that's what it feels like okay it
 

599
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,630
water that's what it feels like okay it
feels like I I now control what happens

600
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:39,640
feels like I I now control what happens
 

601
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,750
feels like I I now control what happens
to this ball okay and it is pressure but

602
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:42,760
to this ball okay and it is pressure but
 

603
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,109
to this ball okay and it is pressure but
it's not the I'm against you muscular

604
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
it's not the I'm against you muscular
 

605
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,750
it's not the I'm against you muscular
tension so yeah there is there

606
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
tension so yeah there is there
 

607
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,870
tension so yeah there is there
is a sense of something greater

608
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:53,880
is a sense of something greater
 

609
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,910
is a sense of something greater
happening but it's different from the

610
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:57,920
happening but it's different from the
 

611
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,510
happening but it's different from the
what we want to normally do right Flex

612
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:00,520
what we want to normally do right Flex
 

613
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,109
what we want to normally do right Flex
against it we start fatiguing pretty

614
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,119
against it we start fatiguing pretty
 

615
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,990
against it we start fatiguing pretty
much like what we're doing as not as UK

616
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,000
much like what we're doing as not as UK
 

617
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,589
much like what we're doing as not as UK
UK is doing what we usually do that's

618
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
UK is doing what we usually do that's
 

619
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,190
UK is doing what we usually do that's
why I said UK is not training and we're

620
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:12,200
why I said UK is not training and we're
 

621
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,750
why I said UK is not training and we're
not doing what we usually do so I you do

622
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
not doing what we usually do so I you do
 

623
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,910
not doing what we usually do so I you do
feel a greatness or a pressure you do

624
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:18,920
feel a greatness or a pressure you do
 

625
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,309
feel a greatness or a pressure you do
feel the force but you don't feel it

626
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:21,319
feel the force but you don't feel it
 

627
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:24,630
feel the force but you don't feel it
exactly like the who kids doing now when

628
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
exactly like the who kids doing now when
 

629
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,069
exactly like the who kids doing now when
they're pushing like my I said my grip

630
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
they're pushing like my I said my grip
 

631
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,670
they're pushing like my I said my grip
and my biceps are tired but my grip and

632
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:30,680
and my biceps are tired but my grip and
 

633
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,349
and my biceps are tired but my grip and
biceps weren't tired at all when he was

634
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:32,359
biceps weren't tired at all when he was
 

635
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,510
biceps weren't tired at all when he was
pushing on me I didn't feel that at all

636
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:34,520
pushing on me I didn't feel that at all
 

637
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,069
pushing on me I didn't feel that at all
okay I would say this

638
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,079
okay I would say this
 

639
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,589
okay I would say this
too

640
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:40,599

 

641
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,109

um the fact that I knowingly

642
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:46,119
um the fact that I knowingly
 

643
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,950
um the fact that I knowingly
flex and then

644
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
flex and then
 

645
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,030
flex and then
suddenly

646
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
suddenly
 

647
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,150
suddenly
unflexed is again what is very important

648
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
unflexed is again what is very important
 

649
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,309
unflexed is again what is very important
is how sensitive am I how aware how do I

650
00:36:58,309 --> 00:36:58,319
is how sensitive am I how aware how do I
 

651
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,430
is how sensitive am I how aware how do I
have in the contestation behavior in the

652
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
have in the contestation behavior in the
 

653
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,750
have in the contestation behavior in the
flexion you see that's very very

654
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
flexion you see that's very very
 

655
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,550
flexion you see that's very very
important and this why you can't really

656
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:05,560
important and this why you can't really
 

657
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,030
important and this why you can't really
separate that mind and body because the

658
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,040
separate that mind and body because the
 

659
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,589
separate that mind and body because the
body will do things totally outside of

660
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:10,599
body will do things totally outside of
 

661
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,790
body will do things totally outside of
our awareness just it'll just do it okay

662
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
our awareness just it'll just do it okay
 

663
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,710
our awareness just it'll just do it okay
um and so part of this is yeah we have

664
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:17,720
um and so part of this is yeah we have
 

665
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,230
um and so part of this is yeah we have
to gain this sensitivity to what is

666
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
to gain this sensitivity to what is
 

667
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,589
to gain this sensitivity to what is
going on so it's not so settle so it's

668
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:22,599
going on so it's not so settle so it's
 

669
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,910
going on so it's not so settle so it's
gross and we understand what's

670
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:24,920
gross and we understand what's
 

671
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,349
gross and we understand what's
happening um now imagine that that you

672
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:28,359
happening um now imagine that that you
 

673
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,190
happening um now imagine that that you
never had that

674
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,200
never had that
 

675
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,349
never had that
experience whatsoever okay so I left you

676
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:34,359
experience whatsoever okay so I left you
 

677
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,150
experience whatsoever okay so I left you
entirely with Virginia pushing you over

678
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,160
entirely with Virginia pushing you over
 

679
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,109
entirely with Virginia pushing you over
just pushing you over you

680
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:40,119
just pushing you over you
 

681
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,750
just pushing you over you
see or I didn't give

682
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
see or I didn't give
 

683
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,910
see or I didn't give
you the

684
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
you the
 

685
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,750
you the
initial Vector through your body for

686
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:50,760
initial Vector through your body for
 

687
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,309
initial Vector through your body for
your body to realize look it's there's a

688
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:53,319
your body to realize look it's there's a
 

689
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,950
your body to realize look it's there's a
dness to this to see that the shoulder

690
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:55,960
dness to this to see that the shoulder
 

691
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,750
dness to this to see that the shoulder
hand right shoulder stabilization and

692
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:58,760
hand right shoulder stabilization and
 

693
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,589
hand right shoulder stabilization and
the pressure design and it wasn't that

694
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:00,599
the pressure design and it wasn't that
 

695

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,440
between the glutes flexing and we went
 

707
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,030
between the glutes flexing and we went
to lateral contestation and then the

708
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,040
to lateral contestation and then the
 

709
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,550
to lateral contestation and then the
glutes relaxing in the contrast you're

01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:24,230
it move it to down now go do it that's
it all

1208
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240

 

1209
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,430

right moving

1210
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
right moving
 

1211
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,950
right moving
Center getting away from the arm and

1212
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:29,960
Center getting away from the arm and
 

1213
01:03:29,960 --> 01:04:19,910
Center getting away from the arm and
shoulder the center

1214
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:19,920

 

1215
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,349

all this is this

1216
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:24,359

 

1217
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,109

uh kind of like remember on the Poke

1218
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
uh kind of like remember on the Poke
 

1219
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,430
uh kind of like remember on the Poke
hole like I'm not knocking him down I'm

1220
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:30,440
hole like I'm not knocking him down I'm
 

1221
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,230
hole like I'm not knocking him down I'm
not sending him back right it was a

1222
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:34,240
not sending him back right it was a
 

1223
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,390
not sending him back right it was a
different

1224
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:35,400
different
 

1225
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,750
different
geometry um but it's so ubiquitous it's

1226
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:38,760
geometry um but it's so ubiquitous it's
 

1227
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,789
geometry um but it's so ubiquitous it's
knock down and send back that that feels

1228
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:42,799
knock down and send back that that feels
 

1229
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,510
knock down and send back that that feels
right and that feels like the only thing

1230
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,520
right and that feels like the only thing
 

1231
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,549
right and that feels like the only thing
I can

1232
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:45,559
I can
 

1233
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,269
I can
do but as we saw it exposes your elbow

1234
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:50,279
do but as we saw it exposes your elbow
 

1235
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:53,870
do but as we saw it exposes your elbow
right sending back that's not

1236
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:53,880
right sending back that's not
 

1237
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,150
right sending back that's not
working alone

1238
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
working alone
 

1239
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,589
working alone
theorized through sound Theory that's

1240
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
theorized through sound Theory that's
 

1241
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,349
theorized through sound Theory that's
that's we're just overpowering that okay

1242
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:03,359
that's we're just overpowering that okay
 

1243
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,430
that's we're just overpowering that okay
so this is another very common

1244
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:06,440
so this is another very common
 

1245
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,150
so this is another very common
one uh

1246
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:10,160
one uh
 

1247
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,510
one uh
rotation

1248
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:12,520
rotation
 

1249
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:17,349
rotation
okay um we don't rotate the hips in

1250
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
okay um we don't rotate the hips in
 

1251
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,910
okay um we don't rotate the hips in
iido we move the quaw this is the amount

1252
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:20,920
iido we move the quaw this is the amount
 

1253
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,589
iido we move the quaw this is the amount
of rotation that I

1254
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:23,599
of rotation that I
 

1255
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:28,309
of rotation that I
get that's it that quaw

1256
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
get that's it that quaw
 

1257
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,190
get that's it that quaw
movement is the same one

1258
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:32,200
movement is the same one
 

1259
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,069
movement is the same one
here we just gave it a number it's 15°

1260
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:36,079
here we just gave it a number it's 15°
 

1261
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,029
here we just gave it a number it's 15°
of rotation we didn't actually measure

1262
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
of rotation we didn't actually measure
 

1263
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,829
of rotation we didn't actually measure
it okay so we just call it

1264
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839

 

1265
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:48,230

15 the idea that I can

1266
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
15 the idea that I can
 

1267
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,750
15 the idea that I can
turn half you see with hip rotation is

1268
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
turn half you see with hip rotation is
 

1269
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,630
turn half you see with hip rotation is

every technique has it but it doesn't

1272
01:05:59,950 --> 01:05:59,960
every technique has it but it doesn't
 

1273
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,710
every technique has it but it doesn't
understand Force

1274
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:01,720
understand Force
 

1275
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,390

01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:00,920

 

1327
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,109

point how about you just start the

1328
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:03,119
point how about you just start the
 

1329
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,549
point how about you just start the
technique and before you do the ENT and

1330
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:05,559
technique and before you do the ENT and
 

1331
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:11,390
technique and before you do the ENT and
turn you stop okay so get the

1332

turn you stop okay so get the
 

1333
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,030
turn you stop okay so get the
technique then you

1334
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:15,040

 

1335
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:19,870

1376
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
got this person trying to regain their
 

1377
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,709
got this person trying to regain their
balance I got this person that won't

1378
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:28,719
balance I got this person that won't
 

1379
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,630
balance I got this person that won't
lose their balance I got this person who

1380
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:31,640
lose their balance I got this person who
 

1381
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,590
lose their balance I got this person who
sometimes is going to push and not push

1382
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
sometimes is going to push and not push
 

1383
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,829
sometimes is going to push and not push
it's all that controll

1384
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
it's all that controll
 

1385
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,789
it's all that controll
again okay this is my middle right

1386
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:39,799
again okay this is my middle right
 

1387
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:42,229
again okay this is my middle right
middle of the dojo what's the difference

1388
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
middle of the dojo what's the difference
 

1389
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,870
middle of the dojo what's the difference
the the skill ukas are F being out of

1390
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:45,880
the the skill ukas are F being out of
 

1391
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,430
the the skill ukas are F being out of
control we're not throwing you there's

1392
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
control we're not throwing you there's
 

1393
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,149
control we're not throwing you there's
really no danger here

1394
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
really no danger here
 

1395
01:09:52,159 --> 01:10:21,270
really no danger here
okay go make yourself vulnerable

1396
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280

 

1397
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,110

you're you're going to be the the

1398
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,120
you're you're going to be the the
 

1399
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,310
you're you're going to be the the
counter rotation to his rotation

1400
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
counter rotation to his rotation
 

1401
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,510
counter rotation to his rotation
so it's going to go around you you're

1402
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:28,520
so it's going to go around you you're
 

1403
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,510
so it's going to go around you you're
the nogin okay and you're going to pull

1404
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:32,520
the nogin okay and you're going to pull
 

1405
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,590
the nogin okay and you're going to pull
him into the

1406
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600

 

1407
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,910

rotation sorry I put your hand on the

1408
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
rotation sorry I put your hand on the
 

1409
01:10:37,920 --> 01:11:20,310
rotation sorry I put your hand on the
wrong side but you fix your hand

1410
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,320

 

1411
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,470

just pull pull the Joe around you pull

1412
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,480
just pull pull the Joe around you pull
 

1413
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:30,630
just pull pull the Joe around you pull
it around you like you would that

1414
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640

 

1415
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:44,189

okay okay are youing

1416
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:44,199

 

1417
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:52,550

this and I'm

1418
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560

 

1419
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,790

not I don't think you guys are

1420
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:54,800
not I don't think you guys are
 

1421
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:06,110
not I don't think you guys are
understanding

1422
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:06,120

 

1423
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,149

this is just Newton's

1424
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
this is just Newton's
 

1425
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,950
this is just Newton's
law

1426
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:09,960
law
 

1427
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,110
law
okay you guys heard of him

1428
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:14,120
okay you guys heard of him
 

1429
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,030
okay you guys heard of him
right it's the opposite and equal

1430
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:18,040
right it's the opposite and equal
 

1431
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:25,790
right it's the opposite and equal
reaction law

1432
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:25,800

 

1433
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,470

States for every Force you do it

1434
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:29,480
States for every Force you do it
 

1435
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,510
States for every Force you do it
generates the opposite inal

1436
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:32,520
generates the opposite inal
 

1437
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,189
generates the opposite inal
reaction your internal aspects are are a

1438
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
reaction your internal aspects are are a
 

1439
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,350
reaction your internal aspects are are a
way around that don't generate an

1440
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:40,360
way around that don't generate an
 

1441
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,709
way around that don't generate an
opposite Force because you're you're

1442
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719
opposite Force because you're you're
 

1443
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,629
opposite Force because you're you're
generating the

1444
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:44,639
generating the
 

1445
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:47,110
generating the
contestation got that

1446
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
contestation got that
 

1447
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,870
contestation got that
okay

1448
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:49,880
okay
 

1449
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,229
okay
so when you are trying to take 's body

1450
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:55,239
so when you are trying to take 's body
 

1451
01:12:55,239 --> 01:13:00,149
so when you are trying to take 's body
into this curve that's a force

1452
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:00,159
into this curve that's a force
 

1453
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,750
into this curve that's a force
line that means there's a force line

1454
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:02,760
line that means there's a force line
 

1455
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,669
line that means there's a force line
going the other

1456
01:13:04,669 --> 01:13:04,679
going the other
 

1457
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:18,669
going the other
way got it

1458
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:18,679

 

1459
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:21,870

okay she's going to take me you're going

1460
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:21,880
okay she's going to take me you're going
 

1461
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,550
okay she's going to take me you're going
to do the turn I going to get me to

1462
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:24,560
to do the turn I going to get me to
 

1463
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,910
to do the turn I going to get me to
where you turn and you're going to turn

1464
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:26,920
where you turn and you're going to turn
 

1465
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,149
where you turn and you're going to turn
okay now you're going to turn me with

generating that
 

1487
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,070
generating that
Force there is going to be an equal and

1488
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
Force there is going to be an equal and
 

1489
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,110
Force there is going to be an equal and
opposite reaction to that

1490
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
opposite reaction to that
 

1491
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,950
opposite reaction to that
Force whether the

1492
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:15,960
Force whether the
 

1493
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,189
Force whether the
person is even fighting against it or

1494
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199
person is even fighting against it or
 

1495

you go pressure
 

1509
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,149
you go pressure
increase okay do it again that's the

1510
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:45,159
increase okay do it again that's the
 

1511
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:49,110
increase okay do it again that's the
opposite Force okay you come around

1512
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
opposite Force okay you come around
 

1513
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,790
