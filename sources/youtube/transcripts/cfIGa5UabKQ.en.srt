00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
i got rid of that

193
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,550
get it so as as my weight shifts it'll
he's pushed it

194
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560

something with my hand that was the
 

203
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,310
something with my hand that was the
whole point

204
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
whole point
 

205
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,790
whole point

that
 

211
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,550
that
putter

212
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
putter
 

213
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,710
putter
okay

214
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
okay
 

215
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,230
okay
uh

216
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
uh
 

217
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,670
uh
secondly

218
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
secondly
 

219
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,350
secondly
uh

220
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
uh
 

221
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,790
uh
if you

222
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
if you
 

223
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,590
if you
brace and you push you're gonna get

224
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
brace and you push you're gonna get
 

225
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,950
brace and you push you're gonna get
pulled because

226
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
pulled because
 

227
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,189
pulled because
you sent him out he's holding on he's

228
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
you sent him out he's holding on he's
 

229
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,189
you sent him out he's holding on he's
getting ready to push back in

230
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
getting ready to push back in
 

231
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,310
getting ready to push back in
um

232
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
um
 

233
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,390
um
you have to look for that that wasn't it

234
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
you have to look for that that wasn't it
 

235
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,990
you have to look for that that wasn't it
either and then also

236
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000

 

237
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,350

sometimes when you were bracing you went

238
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
sometimes when you were bracing you went
 

239
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,430
sometimes when you were bracing you went
on and then you shut it off and you're

240
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
on and then you shut it off and you're
 

241
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,270
on and then you shut it off and you're
gonna get pulled again so there's no off

242
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
gonna get pulled again so there's no off
 

243
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,350
gonna get pulled again so there's no off
you're just doing the same drill the

244
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
you're just doing the same drill the
 

245
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,189
you're just doing the same drill the
reason there's no op is even when it's

246
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
reason there's no op is even when it's
 

247
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,990
reason there's no op is even when it's
just me my weight is on that midfoot

248
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
just me my weight is on that midfoot
 

249
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,189
just me my weight is on that midfoot
pattern so

250
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
pattern so
 

251
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,510
pattern so
uh i'm just keeping that powder

252
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520

 

253
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,550

okay try the reason i had him pushing is

254
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
okay try the reason i had him pushing is
 

255
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,350
okay try the reason i had him pushing is
because when you hit a target it is

256
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
because when you hit a target it is
 

257
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,070
because when you hit a target it is
it is not moving in the direction that

258
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
it is not moving in the direction that
 

259
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
it is not moving in the direction that
i'm going

260
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
i'm going
 

261
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,790
i'm going
uh

262
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
uh
 

263
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,309
uh
even if even if i had it going backwards

264
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
even if even if i had it going backwards
 

265
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,510
even if even if i had it going backwards
uh and i'm hitting him that way i'm

266
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
uh and i'm hitting him that way i'm
 

267
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,150
uh and i'm hitting him that way i'm
still hitting through him so

268
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
still hitting through him so
 

269
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,950
still hitting through him so
there's much of his energy is not

270
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
there's much of his energy is not
 

271
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,110
there's much of his energy is not
traveling in the same direction that i'm

272
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
traveling in the same direction that i'm
 

273
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,070
traveling in the same direction that i'm
going okay and so his energy is coming

274
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
going okay and so his energy is coming
 

275
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,309
going okay and so his energy is coming
towards me in the drill okay and the

276
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
towards me in the drill okay and the
 

277
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,710
towards me in the drill okay and the
little pull thing you don't need to you

278
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
little pull thing you don't need to you
 

279
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,950
little pull thing you don't need to you
don't pull in the drill because

280
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
don't pull in the drill because
 

281
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,350
don't pull in the drill because
he is just uh

282
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
he is just uh
 

283
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,430
he is just uh
trying to do that other thing which

284
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
trying to do that other thing which
 

285
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,710
trying to do that other thing which
is going to be a

286
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
is going to be a
 

287
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,430
is going to be a
more of a stepping stone to this truck

288
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
more of a stepping stone to this truck
 

289
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,309
more of a stepping stone to this truck
okay

290
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
okay
 

291
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,029
okay
um the pool will happen automatically so

292
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
um the pool will happen automatically so
 

293
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,189
um the pool will happen automatically so
it'll it'll test your ikea and ikea

294
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
it'll it'll test your ikea and ikea
 

295
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,710
it'll it'll test your ikea and ikea
always is like that even in the

296
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
always is like that even in the
 

297
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,350
always is like that even in the
techniques it comes up as a result of

298
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
techniques it comes up as a result of
 

299
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,110
techniques it comes up as a result of
cooking okay

300
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
cooking okay
 

301
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,110
cooking okay
so you don't have to

302
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
so you don't have to
 

303
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,189
so you don't have to
do it you don't want to do it okay you

304
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
do it you don't want to do it okay you
 

305
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,790
do it you don't want to do it okay you
want to keep the on

306
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
want to keep the on
 

307
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,430
want to keep the on
so okay has to stay on going up

308
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
so okay has to stay on going up
 

309
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,710
so okay has to stay on going up
all right so um i'm not going to hit him

310
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
all right so um i'm not going to hit him
 

311
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,430
all right so um i'm not going to hit him
and i'm going to disperse the energy of

312
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
and i'm going to disperse the energy of
 

313
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,629
and i'm going to disperse the energy of
the strike

314
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
the strike
 

315
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,189
the strike
um we will work on the

316
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
um we will work on the
 

317
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,070
um we will work on the
outward hand sword okay

318
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
outward hand sword okay
 

319
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,870
outward hand sword okay
so when i say disperse it i'm gonna make

320
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
so when i say disperse it i'm gonna make
 

321
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,270
so when i say disperse it i'm gonna make
my whole my forearm hit as opposed to

322
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
my whole my forearm hit as opposed to
 

323
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,749
my whole my forearm hit as opposed to
just the hand which would be how you hit

324
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
just the hand which would be how you hit
 

325
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,390
just the hand which would be how you hit
on the target okay uh and you can see

326
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
on the target okay uh and you can see
 

327
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,950
on the target okay uh and you can see
okay that's the energy there so i'm just

328
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
okay that's the energy there so i'm just
 

329
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,990
okay that's the energy there so i'm just
going to

330
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
going to
 

331
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,950
going to
get

332
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960

 

333
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,230

okay

334
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
okay
 

335
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,749
okay
at this point there's usually two

336
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
at this point there's usually two
 

337
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,749
at this point there's usually two
beginner mistakes that you want to do

338
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
beginner mistakes that you want to do
 

339
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,629
beginner mistakes that you want to do
because you prioritize moving him you

340
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
because you prioritize moving him you
 

341
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,029
because you prioritize moving him you
see so you're like sensei i'm gonna

342
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
see so you're like sensei i'm gonna
 

343
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,309
see so you're like sensei i'm gonna
do my own okay and so you you start

344
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
do my own okay and so you you start
 

345
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,309
do my own okay and so you you start
to push

346
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
to push
 

347
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,469
to push
that's not a strike how are you starting

348
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
that's not a strike how are you starting
 

349
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,550
that's not a strike how are you starting
to hit from kitchen

350
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
to hit from kitchen
 

351
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,150
to hit from kitchen
you see that

352
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
you see that
 

353
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,589
you see that
two things is

354
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
two things is
 

355
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,710
two things is
um yeah your drills your drills might

356
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
um yeah your drills your drills might
 

357
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,029
um yeah your drills your drills might
your your cultivation drills might

358
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
your your cultivation drills might
 

359
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,390
your your cultivation drills might
prolong

360
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
prolong
 

361
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,749
prolong
uh this whole process

362
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
uh this whole process
 

363
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,629
uh this whole process
but you've got to be able to uh

364
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
but you've got to be able to uh
 

365
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,550
but you've got to be able to uh
shorten the amount of time that it takes

366
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
shorten the amount of time that it takes
 

367
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,949
shorten the amount of time that it takes
to do that okay so you it's going to be

368
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
to do that okay so you it's going to be
 

369
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,550
to do that okay so you it's going to be
lengthened for cultivating reasons but

370
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
lengthened for cultivating reasons but
 

371
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,389
lengthened for cultivating reasons but
you're not going to get anywhere if you

372
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
you're not going to get anywhere if you
 

373
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,709
you're not going to get anywhere if you
can't do the same process oh like spark

374
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
can't do the same process oh like spark
 

375
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,389
can't do the same process oh like spark
from the stone okay

376
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
from the stone okay
 

377
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,870
from the stone okay
um and two

378
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
um and two
 

379
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,150
um and two
um

380
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
um
 

381
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,870
um
when you turn your waist you go to hip

382
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
when you turn your waist you go to hip
 

383
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,230
when you turn your waist you go to hip
rotation

384
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
rotation
 

385
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,949
rotation
you you actually dismantle the the

386
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
you you actually dismantle the the
 

387
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,870
you you actually dismantle the the
internal organization

388
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
internal organization
 

389
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,350
internal organization
um you if you think of it like i get

390
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
um you if you think of it like i get
 

391
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,670
um you if you think of it like i get
expanded with his energy that's coming

392
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
expanded with his energy that's coming
 

393
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,710
expanded with his energy that's coming
into me

394
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
into me
 

395
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,269
into me
uh so imagine like a balloon and now

396
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
uh so imagine like a balloon and now
 

397
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,269
uh so imagine like a balloon and now
you're gonna turn the two hands like

398
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
you're gonna turn the two hands like
 

399
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,269
you're gonna turn the two hands like
because you're going to make a wiener

400
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
because you're going to make a wiener
 

401
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,670
because you're going to make a wiener
dog out of balloons do you get it and

402
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
dog out of balloons do you get it and
 

403
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,910
dog out of balloons do you get it and
it's not very strong you don't want to

404
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
it's not very strong you don't want to
 

405
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,630
it's not very strong you don't want to
uh twist the balloon you're gonna

406
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
uh twist the balloon you're gonna
 

407
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,030
uh twist the balloon you're gonna
decompress so to speak okay

408
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
decompress so to speak okay
 

409
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,630
decompress so to speak okay
um so

410
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
um so
 

411
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,710
um so
as i as i'm doing this

412
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
as i as i'm doing this
 

413
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,790
as i as i'm doing this
it's it's a same process boom but quick

414
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
it's it's a same process boom but quick
 

415
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,470
it's it's a same process boom but quick
quick

416
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480

 

417

okay try it again so again i'm gonna
 

421
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,350
okay try it again so again i'm gonna
disperse the inward hand sword it's a

422
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
disperse the inward hand sword it's a
 

423
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,710
disperse the inward hand sword it's a
little awkward

424
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
little awkward
 

425
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,790
little awkward
uh it's hard to fit in there so you see

426
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
uh it's hard to fit in there so you see
 

427
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,030
uh it's hard to fit in there so you see
on the drill i'm kind of off center yeah

428
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
on the drill i'm kind of off center yeah
 

429
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,389
on the drill i'm kind of off center yeah
i'm not fighting him he's just

430
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
i'm not fighting him he's just
 

431
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,910
i'm not fighting him he's just
resistance okay

432
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
resistance okay
 

433
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,750
resistance okay
uh and i like using the body as

434
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
uh and i like using the body as
 

435
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,509
uh and i like using the body as
resistance because there's nothing that

436
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
resistance because there's nothing that
 

437
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,509
resistance because there's nothing that
quite feels like the body

438
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
quite feels like the body
 

439
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,310
quite feels like the body
um

440
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
um
 

441
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,949
um
the machiwara that's why it's flexible

442
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
the machiwara that's why it's flexible
 

443
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,470
the machiwara that's why it's flexible
because it there's give and take

444
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
because it there's give and take
 

445
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,389
because it there's give and take
not like a board or something like that

446
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
not like a board or something like that
 

447
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,430
not like a board or something like that
okay

448
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
okay
 

449
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
okay
and all those little give and takes and

450
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
and all those little give and takes and
 

451
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,670
and all those little give and takes and
fluids and joints and points of

452
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
fluids and joints and points of
 

453
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,829
fluids and joints and points of
articulation just body it all creates

454
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
articulation just body it all creates
 

455
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,990
articulation just body it all creates
different angles of different things i

456
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
different angles of different things i
 

457
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,389
different angles of different things i
gotta address and send down through me

458
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
gotta address and send down through me
 

459
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,150
gotta address and send down through me
to the ground okay

460
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
to the ground okay
 

461
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,949
to the ground okay
uh

462
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
uh
 

463
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,430
uh
so i still have to disperse the energy

464
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
so i still have to disperse the energy
 

465
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,790
so i still have to disperse the energy
because i don't want to

466
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
because i don't want to
 

467
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,630
because i don't want to
cause any damage on him so i'm going to

468
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
cause any damage on him so i'm going to
 

469
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,949
cause any damage on him so i'm going to
disperse the energy okay

470
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
disperse the energy okay
 

471
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,350
disperse the energy okay
i'm here and i'm going to so i have to

472
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
i'm here and i'm going to so i have to
 

473
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,630
i'm here and i'm going to so i have to
do the same

474
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
do the same
 

475
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:45,350
do the same
powder

476
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360

 

477
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,350

you this is just general rule and i

478
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
you this is just general rule and i
 

479
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,630
you this is just general rule and i
didn't mention it because it's so

480
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
didn't mention it because it's so
 

481
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,190
didn't mention it because it's so
general you don't hit the surface

482
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
general you don't hit the surface
 

483
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,670
general you don't hit the surface
you don't hit the surface you you're

484
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
you don't hit the surface you you're
 

485
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,790
you don't hit the surface you you're
hitting somewhere back here okay and so

486
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
hitting somewhere back here okay and so
 

487
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,790
hitting somewhere back here okay and so
in your focal point

488
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
in your focal point
 

489
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,350
in your focal point
it's back here got it

490
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
it's back here got it
 

491
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,150
it's back here got it
don't don't don't kiss the surface so my

492
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
don't don't don't kiss the surface so my
 

493
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,470
don't don't don't kiss the surface so my
teacher used to say don't don't knock

494
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
teacher used to say don't don't knock
 

495
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,230
teacher used to say don't don't knock
the oranges off

496
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
the oranges off
 

497
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,710
the oranges off
off the tree take it and smash it into

498
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
off the tree take it and smash it into
 

499
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,350
off the tree take it and smash it into
the trunk okay so that's the difference

500
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
the trunk okay so that's the difference
 

501
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,150
the trunk okay so that's the difference
so you're not you're not here

502
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
so you're not you're not here
 

503
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,150
so you're not you're not here
and you're trying to do that you see

504
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
and you're trying to do that you see
 

505
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,990
and you're trying to do that you see
you're trying to get back here well some

506
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
you're trying to get back here well some
 

507
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,350
you're trying to get back here well some
of you are

508
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
of you are
 

509
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,750
of you are
touching here and then pushing back

510
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
touching here and then pushing back
 

511
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,550
touching here and then pushing back
there and that's not it okay so my hand

512
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
there and that's not it okay so my hand
 

513
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,030
there and that's not it okay so my hand
is quick

514
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
is quick
 

515
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,910
is quick
you could i would pay attention to how

516
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
you could i would pay attention to how
 

517
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,389
you could i would pay attention to how
fast the hand is moving through space

518
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
