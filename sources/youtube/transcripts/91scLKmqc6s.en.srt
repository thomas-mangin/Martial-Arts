00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,510

with my clubs you can see the same

2
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
with my clubs you can see the same
 

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,479
with my clubs you can see the same
direction at the same time and also know

4
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,489
direction at the same time and also know
 

5
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,869
direction at the same time and also know
that keep a safe distance apart

6
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
that keep a safe distance apart
 

7
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,569
that keep a safe distance apart
throughout also the turn from the body

8
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:56,579
throughout also the turn from the body
 

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,910
throughout also the turn from the body
not just an hour and if you can't not to

10
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
not just an hour and if you can't not to
 

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,539
not just an hour and if you can't not to
pick it up yourselves

12
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:04,549
pick it up yourselves
 

13
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,980
pick it up yourselves
so here I'm breaking down the movement

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:06,990
so here I'm breaking down the movement
 

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,490
so here I'm breaking down the movement
into four key points you've got your

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
into four key points you've got your
 

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:20,499
into four key points you've got your
left

18
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:20,509

 

19
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,969

when you're happy you pull those more

20
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:22,979
when you're happy you pull those more
 

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,850
when you're happy you pull those more
key points just pick up some cups and

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,860
key points just pick up some cups and
 

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,010
key points just pick up some cups and
just do the same thing just go through

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,020
just do the same thing just go through
 

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,930
just do the same thing just go through
those four segments these four key

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:35,940
those four segments these four key
 

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:51,050
those four segments these four key
points quite fun so when you comfortable

28
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,060
points quite fun so when you comfortable
 

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,850
points quite fun so when you comfortable
with that and try and smooth out maybe

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860
with that and try and smooth out maybe
 

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,859
with that and try and smooth out maybe
divide it into halves so you just do the

32
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:00,869
divide it into halves so you just do the
 

33
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,969
divide it into halves so you just do the
bond and then when you're comfortable

34
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:07,979
bond and then when you're comfortable
 

35
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,630
bond and then when you're comfortable
with that just do the full circle

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640

 

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:26,630

directions

38
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640

 

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,210

quickly show you a common mistake when

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,220
quickly show you a common mistake when
 

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,280
quickly show you a common mistake when
you don't keep your arms together you

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,290
you don't keep your arms together you
 

43
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,920
you don't keep your arms together you
can see this head don't revisit the four

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:37,930
can see this head don't revisit the four
 

45
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,039
can see this head don't revisit the four
key points second mistake is usually

46
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,049
key points second mistake is usually
 

47
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,800
key points second mistake is usually
comes there too heavily anyway just

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:43,810
comes there too heavily anyway just
 

49
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,110
comes there too heavily anyway just
swings you around like this which will

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
swings you around like this which will
 

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,680
swings you around like this which will
imbalance so the correct form will be to

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,690
imbalance so the correct form will be to
 

53
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,960
imbalance so the correct form will be to
keep your posture stable by keeping your

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:51,970
keep your posture stable by keeping your
 

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:01,640
keep your posture stable by keeping your
spine straight and to use it your answer

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:01,650

 

57
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,710

so we'll move on to a variation of the

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
so we'll move on to a variation of the
 

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,809
so we'll move on to a variation of the
same time same direction which is a

60
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:06,819
same time same direction which is a
 

61
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,809
same time same direction which is a
shorter rail you can see I'm taking the

62
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:09,819
shorter rail you can see I'm taking the
 

63
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:15,740
shorter rail you can see I'm taking the
club's behind to my head

64
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:15,750

 

65
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,420

same as before both are going at the

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,430
same as before both are going at the
 

67
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,030
same as before both are going at the
same time same direction so I'll have a

68
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,040
same time same direction so I'll have a
 

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,080
same time same direction so I'll have a
look at it again without clubs I'm using

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,090
look at it again without clubs I'm using
 

71
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:35,420
look at it again without clubs I'm using
some earphones and crops here if you

72
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,430

 

73
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,039

notice I'm still using the key points

74
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,049
notice I'm still using the key points
 

75
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:47,009
notice I'm still using the key points
here so I'm taking it to the left by

76
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:47,019
here so I'm taking it to the left by
 

77
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,599
here so I'm taking it to the left by
using this method it's ensuring that

78
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:48,609
using this method it's ensuring that
 

79
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,460
using this method it's ensuring that
your hands if I decide to be head rather

80
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,470
your hands if I decide to be head rather
 

81
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,280
your hands if I decide to be head rather
then

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,290
then
 

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,289
then
going over the top of the head so when

84
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:53,299
going over the top of the head so when
 

85
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,199
going over the top of the head so when
it comes to using clubs and help by

86
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,209
it comes to using clubs and help by
 

87
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,080
it comes to using clubs and help by
yourself so like before once you've got

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,090
yourself so like before once you've got
 

89
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,380
yourself so like before once you've got
that moogly try and smooth that out

90

the clubs okay so do the same movement
 

101
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,510
the clubs okay so do the same movement
break it down nature those key points

102
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
break it down nature those key points
 

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,089
break it down nature those key points
and then when you're happy with that you

104
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:28,099
and then when you're happy with that you
 

105
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:37,749
and then when you're happy with that you
can just try and do it more motion also

106
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
can just try and do it more motion also
 

107
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,610
