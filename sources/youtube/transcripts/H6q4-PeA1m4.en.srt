I know there's a lot of paradigms on how

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,710
I know there's a lot of paradigms on how
to understand the internal aspects I

to understand the internal aspects I
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,790
to understand the internal aspects I
have my own okay it's a combination of

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
have my own okay it's a combination of
 

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,549
have my own okay it's a combination of
experience and

experience and

then academic study that that makes a

the second you
spot this machine model you should just

spot this machine model you should just
 

45
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,950
spot this machine model you should just
immediately go it's wrong that's not

immediately go it's wrong that's not
 

47
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,190
immediately go it's wrong that's not
right and you should strive constantly

right and you should strive constantly
 

49
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,749
right and you should strive constantly
to subvert the Machine model where it

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
to subvert the Machine model where it
 

51
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,190
to subvert the Machine model where it
doesn't make

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,990
doesn't make
sense so in the Machine model of the

it but what we're doing in these drills
 

1265
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,109
it but what we're doing in these drills
and it's fine that you guys are is I'm

I'm using external forces to get you in
 

1269
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,470
I'm using external forces to get you in
the

1270

the
ballpark

1272
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
ballpark
 

1273
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,990
ballpark
okay um such that on this last drill I'm

1274
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,000
okay um such that on this last drill I'm
 

1275

okay um such that on this last drill I'm
I'm lifting you see and if he as long as

1276
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm lifting you see and if he as long as
 

1277
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,349
I'm lifting you see and if he as long as
he keeps his hands down it generates a

1278
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
he keeps his hands down it generates a
 

1279
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,349
he keeps his hands down it generates a
friction there do you get it but at the

1280
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
friction there do you get it but at the
 

1281
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,910
friction there do you get it but at the
end there I'm barely touching him like

1282
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:56,920
end there I'm barely touching him like
 

1283
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,510
end there I'm barely touching him like
now I'm not lifting at all and you could

1284
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
now I'm not lifting at all and you could
 

1285
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,910
now I'm not lifting at all and you could
feel the same stick is

1286
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
feel the same stick is
 

1287
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,870
feel the same stick is
there you see which is you you can see

1288
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:05,880
there you see which is you you can see
 

1289
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,390
there you see which is you you can see
how relaxed we are but you can see that

1290
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
how relaxed we are but you can see that
 

1291
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,069
how relaxed we are but you can see that
you still have

1292
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
you still have
 

1293
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,270
you still have
it and that's what you want to get to

1294
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
it and that's what you want to get to
 

1295
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,950
it and that's what you want to get to
okay so if you're like I still feel

1296
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
okay so if you're like I still feel
 

1297
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,190
okay so if you're like I still feel
slippery right still feel then just tell

1298
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
slippery right still feel then just tell
 

1299
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,390
slippery right still feel then just tell
them to push more to generate more of

1300
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:21,400
them to push more to generate more of
 

1301
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,950
them to push more to generate more of
that the physical adhesion that comes

1302
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:23,960
that the physical adhesion that comes
 

1303
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,710
that the physical adhesion that comes
from two two contrary forces pushing on

1304
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:27,720
from two two contrary forces pushing on
 

1305
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,870
from two two contrary forces pushing on
each other but obviously that's not what

1306
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:29,880
each other but obviously that's not what
 

1307
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,270
each other but obviously that's not what
we're after

1308

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,510
you see that and I because of how I'm
trained to pull my hands back it's going

1330
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:12,520
trained to pull my hands back it's going
 

1331
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,670
trained to pull my hands back it's going
into my center and you should feel your

1332
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:14,680
into my center and you should feel your
 

1333
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,510
into my center and you should feel your
Center going too you do feel the

1334
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
Center going too you do feel the
 

1335
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,790
Center going too you do feel the
pressure increase at the contact point

1336
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:19,800
pressure increase at the contact point
 

1337
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,270
pressure increase at the contact point
at the hands but you should feel your

1338
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,280
at the hands but you should feel your
 

1339
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,470
at the hands but you should feel your
ground Vector get heavier you see that

1340
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
ground Vector get heavier you see that
 

1341
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,990
ground Vector get heavier you see that
you feel that okay so I watch I'm going

1342
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,000
you feel that okay so I watch I'm going
 

1343
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,910
you feel that okay so I watch I'm going
to increase it if you couldn't feel it

1344
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:28,920
to increase it if you couldn't feel it
 

1345
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,670
to increase it if you couldn't feel it
and you'll feel the ground Vector get

1346
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:30,680
and you'll feel the ground Vector get
 

1347
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,390
and you'll feel the ground Vector get
heavier on your body as it starts to

1348
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,400
heavier on your body as it starts to
 

1349
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,190
heavier on your body as it starts to
pull on your Center you see that I'm

1350
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,200
pull on your Center you see that I'm
 

1351
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,829
pull on your Center you see that I'm
pulling him now okay so now I'm going to

1352
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:38,839
pulling him now okay so now I'm going to
 

1353
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,190
pulling him now okay so now I'm going to
go

1354
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200

 

1355
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,829

back give you back

1356
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839

 

1357
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,349

control take it back okay

1358
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:52,359

 

1359
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,829

more hands down weight of the hand down

1360
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
more hands down weight of the hand down

there it is okay so now go back to what

1364
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,400
there it is okay so now go back to what
 

1365
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,030
there it is okay so now go back to what
I want to say as I try to pull my hand

1366
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,040
I want to say as I try to pull my hand
 

1367
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,829

1376
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
pull it starts to move me forward you
 

1377
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,470
pull it starts to move me forward you
pay attention I'm moving more forward

1378
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
pay attention I'm moving more forward
 

1379
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,069
pay attention I'm moving more forward
don't let your hands move keep your

1380
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:20,079
don't let your hands move keep your
 

1381
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,069
don't let your hands move keep your
hands still keep your hands still in

1382
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
hands still keep your hands still in
 

1383
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,150
hands still keep your hands still in
space as if I'm pulling my there it is

1384
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,160
space as if I'm pulling my there it is
 

1385
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,630
space as if I'm pulling my there it is
and you see as I pull my hands pressure

1386
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:27,640
and you see as I pull my hands pressure
 

1387
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,829
and you see as I pull my hands pressure
is increasing it's just making me move

1388

okay so there's the you feel the skin
 

1395
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,430
okay so there's the you feel the skin
okay and you're going to move you're

1396
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
okay and you're going to move you're
 

1397
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,790
okay and you're going to move you're
going to try to move your hands back and

1398
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:41,800
going to try to move your hands back and
 

1399
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,550
going to try to move your hands back and
I just keep you're going to try to make

1400
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:43,560
I just keep you're going to try to make
 

1401
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,710
I just keep you're going to try to make
your hands go that way okay and you're

1402
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:45,720
your hands go that way okay and you're
 

1403
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,349
your hands go that way okay and you're
going to feel there's the increase in

1404
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:48,359
going to feel there's the increase in
 

1405
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:51,430
going to feel there's the increase in
the hand contact pressure see and you

1406
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440
the hand contact pressure see and you
 

1407
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,270
the hand contact pressure see and you
can see that he's moving forward he

1408
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
can see that he's moving forward he
 

1409
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,309
can see that he's moving forward he
starts to move forward okay and that's

1410
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:55,319
starts to move forward okay and that's
 

1411
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,990
starts to move forward okay and that's
stuff that you could exaggerate

1412
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
stuff that you could exaggerate
 

1413
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,910
stuff that you could exaggerate
as you do like the CQ game okay and uh

1414
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:02,920
as you do like the CQ game okay and uh
 

1415
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,349
as you do like the CQ game okay and uh
that doesn't

1416
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:04,359
that doesn't
 

1417
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:07,109
that doesn't
happen if he just grabs my

1418
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
happen if he just grabs my
 

1419
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,349
happen if he just grabs my
arm do you see he just grabs my arm

1420
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
arm do you see he just grabs my arm
 

1421
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,430
arm do you see he just grabs my arm
because I can pull that it doesn't make

1422
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
because I can pull that it doesn't make
 

1423
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,390
because I can pull that it doesn't make
me pull forward do you get it let's say

1424
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
me pull forward do you get it let's say
 

1425
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,790
me pull forward do you get it let's say
he holds it really really strongly

1426
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
he holds it really really strongly
 

1427
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,990
he holds it really really strongly
really

1428
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,000
really
 

1429
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,069
really
strongly uh right and you're like well

1430
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,079
strongly uh right and you're like well
 

1431
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,589
strongly uh right and you're like well
that would yeah but it takes more

1432
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
that would yeah but it takes more
 

1433
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,430
that would yeah but it takes more
strength on him to do that right the

1434
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:30,440
strength on him to do that right the
 

1435
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,230
strength on him to do that right the
other one didn't take any strength it

1436
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
other one didn't take any strength it
 

1437
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,790
other one didn't take any strength it
just happens and as he increases his

1438
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:34,800
just happens and as he increases his
 

1439
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,349
just happens and as he increases his
strength with his pool because he

1440
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
strength with his pool because he
 

1441
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,109
strength with his pool because he
doesn't have my my Center then I can

1442
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
doesn't have my my Center then I can
 

1443
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,430
doesn't have my my Center then I can
change my leverage do you see and then

1444
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:44,440
change my leverage do you see and then
 

1445
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,670
change my leverage do you see and then
externally and that's what all Grapplers

1446
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:46,680
externally and that's what all Grapplers
 

1447
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,430
externally and that's what all Grapplers
do okay he would be looking for

1448
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
do okay he would be looking for
 

1449
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,710
do okay he would be looking for
mechanical advantage and I would look

1450
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:51,720
mechanical advantage and I would look
 

1451
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,750
mechanical advantage and I would look
for a mechanical advantage and what the

1452
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,760
for a mechanical advantage and what the
 

1453
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,349
for a mechanical advantage and what the
energetic does it goes wherever you're

1454
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:56,359
energetic does it goes wherever you're
 

1455
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,870
energetic does it goes wherever you're
looking for your mechanical advantage by

1456
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
looking for your mechanical advantage by
 

1457
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,589
looking for your mechanical advantage by
repositioning your

okay get the stick and now hold it still
 

1489
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,190
okay get the stick and now hold it still
in space so I can't pull it and I can't

1490
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,200
in space so I can't pull it and I can't
 

1491
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,910
in space so I can't pull it and I can't
push

1492
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920

 

1493
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,750

it think gu I think I'm going to push

1494
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:58,760
it think gu I think I'm going to push
 

1495
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,750
it think gu I think I'm going to push
you there it

1496
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:00,760
you there it
 

1497
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,990
you there it
is okay so the same thing as I go to

1498
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,000
is okay so the same thing as I go to
 

1499
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,829
is okay so the same thing as I go to
push you see what's happening I feel it

1500
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:07,839
push you see what's happening I feel it
 

1501
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,030
push you see what's happening I feel it
in my feet I feel it in my

1502
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
in my feet I feel it in my
 

1503
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,630
in my feet I feel it in my
center and I'm just pushing myself away

1504
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
center and I'm just pushing myself away
 

1505
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,230
center and I'm just pushing myself away
is what's

1506
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240

 

1507
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,630

happening there it

1508
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640

 

1509
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,630

is whereas if we're here and he's just

1510
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:26,640
is whereas if we're here and he's just
 

1511
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,710
is whereas if we're here and he's just
holding me like he's blocking me then I

1512
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:29,720
holding me like he's blocking me then I
 

1513
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,990
holding me like he's blocking me then I
can just

1514
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,000
can just
 

1515
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,990
can just
push doesn't affect my Center maybe it

1516
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
push doesn't affect my Center maybe it
 

1517
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,549
push doesn't affect my Center maybe it
turns me doesn't affect my Cent okay so

1518
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:37,559
turns me doesn't affect my Cent okay so
 

1519
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,790
turns me doesn't affect my Cent okay so
you feel it

1520
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
you feel it
 

1521
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,390
you feel it
okay you try and

1522
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:43,400
okay you try and
 

1523
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,670
okay you try and
push push harder and look at his

1524
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:46,680
push push harder and look at his
 

1525
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,030
push push harder and look at his
knees okay that and that's why if you

1526
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,040
knees okay that and that's why if you
 

1527
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,430
knees okay that and that's why if you
pay attention in the co cuc cane he will

1528
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:53,440
pay attention in the co cuc cane he will
 

1529
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,309
pay attention in the co cuc cane he will
not push on me okay cuz he knows that

1530
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,319
not push on me okay cuz he knows that
 

1531
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,870
not push on me okay cuz he knows that
that's I push on him I just going to get

1532
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
that's I push on him I just going to get
 

1533
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,750
that's I push on him I just going to get
projected out correct you bastard

1534
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:04,760

 

1535
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,030

okay but it's making me better at the

1536
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,040
okay but it's making me better at the
 

1537
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,190
okay but it's making me better at the
adhesion part the pulling energy the

1538
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,200
adhesion part the pulling energy the
 

1539
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,309
adhesion part the pulling energy the
controlling energy okay that's why he he

1540
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:13,319
controlling energy okay that's why he he
 

1541
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,109
controlling energy okay that's why he he
like don't push don't push okay all

1542
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:16,119
like don't push don't push okay all
 

1543
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,589
like don't push don't push okay all
right let's go to another

1544
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:18,599
right let's go to another
 

1545
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,470
right let's go to another
one make it even more grosser cuz we're

1546
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,480
one make it even more grosser cuz we're
 

1547
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,670
one make it even more grosser cuz we're
going to ask more of it and this is the

1548
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:24,680
going to ask more of it and this is the
 

1549
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,549
going to ask more of it and this is the
first the the the second iy drill

1550
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:29,559
first the the the second iy drill
 

1551
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,829
first the the the second iy drill
okay so um he's going to lift up so

1552
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:34,839
okay so um he's going to lift up so
 

1553
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,589
okay so um he's going to lift up so
there's more mass there do you see and

1554
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:36,599
there's more mass there do you see and
 

1555
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,910
there's more mass there do you see and
he's going to lift up on his arms and so

1556
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:38,920
he's going to lift up on his arms and so
 

1557
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,430
he's going to lift up on his arms and so
as he's

1558
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:40,440
as he's
 

1559
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,430
as he's
lifting you hold just like you were here

1560
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:44,440
lifting you hold just like you were here
 

1561
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,990
lifting you hold just like you were here
and I was lifting and he put that

1562
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
and I was lifting and he put that
 

1563
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,589
and I was lifting and he put that
organization in

1564
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
organization in
 

1565
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,349
organization in
place he's

1566
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
place he's
 

1567
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,150
place he's
lifting you're nog at me you're going to

1568
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:55,160
lifting you're nog at me you're going to
 

1569
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,510
lifting you're nog at me you're going to
feel the same you do the same organ

1570
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
feel the same you do the same organ
 

1571
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,990
feel the same you do the same organ
iation okay and you make him lift keep

1572
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
iation okay and you make him lift keep
 

1573
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,549
iation okay and you make him lift keep
lifting and then you just move the keep

1574
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:04,559
lifting and then you just move the keep
 

1575
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,349
lifting and then you just move the keep
you don't you keep lifting no matter

1576
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:06,359
you don't you keep lifting no matter
 

1577
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:10,030
you don't you keep lifting no matter
what and you move that

1578
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,040

 

1579
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,750

forward okay at this time we're going to

1580
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:12,760
forward okay at this time we're going to
 

1581
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,750
forward okay at this time we're going to
move our

1582
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:18,760

 

1583
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,829

body start in front you can start lower

1584
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
body start in front you can start lower
 

1585
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,349
body start in front you can start lower
if you want he

1586
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:24,359
if you want he
 

1587
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:32,870
if you want he
lifts I don't want you hooking here pull

1588
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880

 

1589
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,910

it you can't have one rate okay it's a

1590
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:36,920
it you can't have one rate okay it's a
 

1591
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,510
it you can't have one rate okay it's a
feeling so here I can have one rate but

1592
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:40,520
feeling so here I can have one rate but
 

1593
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,270
feeling so here I can have one rate but
as it as his radius changes on his

1594
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
as it as his radius changes on his
 

1595
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,910
as it as his radius changes on his
shoulders you have to change that to

1596
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:46,920
shoulders you have to change that to
 

1597
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:54,870
shoulders you have to change that to
keep it to where the friction works for

1598
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880

 

1599
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,590

you I'm slipping

1600
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:01,600

 

1601

1603
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:17,990

keep the

1604
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000

 

1605
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,510

feeling okay try

1606
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
feeling okay try
 

1607
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,030
feeling okay try
no all right so as you come around there

1608
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040
no all right so as you come around there
 

1609
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,230
no all right so as you come around there
it is right

1610
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,240
it is right
 

1611
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,710
it is right
there that same the same energy put your

1612
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
there that same the same energy put your
 

1613
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,950
there that same the same energy put your
arms together he's lifting up and I

1614
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
arms together he's lifting up and I
 

1615
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,190
arms together he's lifting up and I
generate that same

1616
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
generate that same
 

1617
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,230
generate that same
friction the

1618
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:41,240
friction the
 

1619
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,510
friction the

Vector the centrifugal
energy down okay and that don't

1636
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
energy down okay and that don't
 

1637
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,150
energy down okay and that don't
grab that's what you

1638
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,160
grab that's what you
 

1639
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,549
grab that's what you
use and it's going to change as you cut

1640
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:16,559
use and it's going to change as you cut
 

1641
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,150
use and it's going to change as you cut
the angle and as he's falling okay it

1642
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
the angle and as he's falling okay it
 

1643
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,870
the angle and as he's falling okay it
changes so the

1644
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:21,880
changes so the
 

1645
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,190
changes so the
feeling is what you

1646
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:24,200
feeling is what you
 

1647
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:35,549
feeling is what you
want the feeling

1648
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:35,559

 

1649
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,109

you feel it on your

1650
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:39,119

 

1651
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,390

face so you have to move to

1652
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:43,400
