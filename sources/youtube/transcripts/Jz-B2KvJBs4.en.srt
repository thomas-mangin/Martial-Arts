00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
hi I'm Christopher Hine we're talking
 

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,589
hi I'm Christopher Hine we're talking
about basic folk in in this I'm actually

00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
about basic folk in in this I'm actually
 

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,150
about basic folk in in this I'm actually
going to take a little sidestep from

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160
going to take a little sidestep from
 

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,950
going to take a little sidestep from
book in for just a second because we

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
book in for just a second because we
 

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,609
book in for just a second because we
have to talk about something that's

12
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:19,619
have to talk about something that's
 

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,710
have to talk about something that's
really important to understanding sword

14
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
really important to understanding sword
 

15
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,750
really important to understanding sword
work in general and this understanding

16
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
work in general and this understanding
 

17
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,120
work in general and this understanding
is about the timings of the body so

18
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,130
is about the timings of the body so
 

19
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,220
is about the timings of the body so
timing is one of the most difficult

20
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,230
timing is one of the most difficult
 

21
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,900
timing is one of the most difficult
things to understand in all martial art

22
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:29,910
things to understand in all martial art
 

23
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,609
things to understand in all martial art
practices a different martial arts have

24

practices a different martial arts have
 

25
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,990
practices a different martial arts have
different ways of talking about timing

26
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,000
different ways of talking about timing
 

27
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,819
different ways of talking about timing
and timing is really essential to

28
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:34,829
and timing is really essential to
 

29
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,020
and timing is really essential to
everything we're gonna do in the martial

30
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,030
everything we're gonna do in the martial
 

31

however discussing it logically and

34
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
however discussing it logically and
 

35
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,010
however discussing it logically and
analytically becomes very very difficult

36
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,020
analytically becomes very very difficult

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,170
analytically becomes very very difficult
I'm going to use a really simple system

38
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm going to use a really simple system
 

39
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,810
I'm going to use a really simple system
that I discovered this use of the system

40
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
that I discovered this use of the system
 

41
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,150
that I discovered this use of the system
from George silver who's a was a

42
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
from George silver who's a was a
 

43
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,369
from George silver who's a was a
swordsman back in the day in England and

44
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:49,379
swordsman back in the day in England and
 

45
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,590
swordsman back in the day in England and
George silver had an interesting method

46
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
George silver had an interesting method
 

47
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
George silver had an interesting method
of talking about this which was the time

48
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,370
of talking about this which was the time
 

49
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,100
of talking about this which was the time
of the hand the time of the foot and the

50
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,110
of the hand the time of the foot and the
 

51
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,660
of the hand the time of the foot and the
time of the body and that's to

52
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:56,670
time of the body and that's to
 

53
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,360
time of the body and that's to
understand that if I'm moving some piece

54
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,370
understand that if I'm moving some piece
 

55
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,090
understand that if I'm moving some piece
of me my hand moves the fastest right so

56
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,100
of me my hand moves the fastest right so
 

57
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,139
of me my hand moves the fastest right so
if I need just reach out and grab

58
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:03,149
if I need just reach out and grab
 

59
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,880
if I need just reach out and grab
something my hand can do it really

60
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:04,890
something my hand can do it really
 

61
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,160
something my hand can do it really
really fast my body can do it second

62
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,170
really fast my body can do it second
 

63
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,810
really fast my body can do it second
fast so if my hand couldn't move any

64
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:08,820
fast so if my hand couldn't move any
 

65
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,460
fast so if my hand couldn't move any
further and I had to use my body to

66
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:10,470
further and I had to use my body to
 

67
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,500
further and I had to use my body to
reach over and grab something then that

68
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,510
reach over and grab something then that
 

69
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,450
reach over and grab something then that
moves the second-fastest it doesn't move

70
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
moves the second-fastest it doesn't move
 

71
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,370
moves the second-fastest it doesn't move
as fast as my hand but it moves faster

72
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:16,380
as fast as my hand but it moves faster
 

73
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,320
as fast as my hand but it moves faster
than my foot and so the time of the foot

74
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,330
than my foot and so the time of the foot
 

75
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,840
than my foot and so the time of the foot
would be if my hand and Center were

76
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:20,850
would be if my hand and Center were
 

77
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,429
would be if my hand and Center were
locked in place and actually had to take

78
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:22,439
locked in place and actually had to take
 

79
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,230
locked in place and actually had to take
a step to grab something somewhere else

80
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
a step to grab something somewhere else
 

81
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,060
a step to grab something somewhere else
this might not seem like it's very

82
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,070
this might not seem like it's very
 

83
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,800
this might not seem like it's very
important but understanding this is

84
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:27,810
important but understanding this is
 

85
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,899
important but understanding this is
pivotal in my opinion a pivotal

86
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
pivotal in my opinion a pivotal
 

87
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,219
pivotal in my opinion a pivotal
understanding a whole lot of Aikido but

88
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:31,229
understanding a whole lot of Aikido but
 

89
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,560
understanding a whole lot of Aikido but
sword work particularly and this is not

90
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,570
sword work particularly and this is not
 

91
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,090
sword work particularly and this is not
just the sword work of Aikido it's the

92
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,100
just the sword work of Aikido it's the
 

93
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,800
just the sword work of Aikido it's the
sort of work of of pretty much any

94
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:36,810
sort of work of of pretty much any
 

95
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,910
sort of work of of pretty much any
country you want to look into

96
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
country you want to look into
 

97
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,010
country you want to look into
understanding this concept in one way or

98
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,020
understanding this concept in one way or
 

99
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,480
understanding this concept in one way or
another is really important because

100
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,490
another is really important because
 

101
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,880
another is really important because
swords are super sharp and so because of

102
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:43,890
swords are super sharp and so because of
 

103
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,190
swords are super sharp and so because of
the super sharpness if you're in range

104
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
the super sharpness if you're in range
 

105
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,050
the super sharpness if you're in range
for me to make a quick action with my

106
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
for me to make a quick action with my
 

107
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,760
for me to make a quick action with my
hand and I cut you you're almost

108
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:49,770
hand and I cut you you're almost
 

109
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,740
hand and I cut you you're almost
certainly gonna get cut now the reason

110
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
certainly gonna get cut now the reason
 

111
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,969
certainly gonna get cut now the reason
for this is because you don't have

112
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:52,979
for this is because you don't have
 

113
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,920
for this is because you don't have
enough reaction time to deal with my

114
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:54,930
enough reaction time to deal with my
 

115
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,139
enough reaction time to deal with my
hands moving into action however if you

116
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:57,149
hands moving into action however if you
 

117
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,569
hands moving into action however if you
can keep it arranged that I can't just

118
00:01:59,569 --> 00:01:59,579
can keep it arranged that I can't just
 

119
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,920
can keep it arranged that I can't just
move my hand and attack you that I have

120
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:00,930
move my hand and attack you that I have
 

121
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,109
move my hand and attack you that I have
to move my hand with my body to get a

122
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
to move my hand with my body to get a
 

123
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,789
to move my hand with my body to get a
little further reach right so I'll give

124
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
little further reach right so I'll give
 

125
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,490
little further reach right so I'll give
you an example here with Josh

126
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:08,500

 

127
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,650

okay so talking about that distance

128
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,660
okay so talking about that distance
 

129
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,240
okay so talking about that distance
between the two of us right now we're

130
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,250
between the two of us right now we're
 

131
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,440
between the two of us right now we're
pretty close to what would be a

132
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,450
pretty close to what would be a
 

133
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,910
pretty close to what would be a
fingertip distance right

134
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
fingertip distance right
 

135
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,650
fingertip distance right
so this fingertip distance and you know

136
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:17,660
so this fingertip distance and you know
 

137
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,300
so this fingertip distance and you know
this is a classic thing and I can't talk

138
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,310
this is a classic thing and I can't talk
 

139
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,830
this is a classic thing and I can't talk
about this all the time in talk about it

140
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
about this all the time in talk about it
 

141
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,690
about this all the time in talk about it
so much that people say oh that lame

142
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:22,700
so much that people say oh that lame
 

143
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,910
so much that people say oh that lame
fingertip distance thing it's really

144
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:24,920
fingertip distance thing it's really
 

145
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,290
fingertip distance thing it's really
really important what that fingertip

146
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,300
really important what that fingertip
 

147
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,449
really important what that fingertip
distance shows us is it's impossible for

148
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:28,459
distance shows us is it's impossible for
 

149
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,699
distance shows us is it's impossible for
me to make any kind of contact with Josh

150
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:30,709
me to make any kind of contact with Josh
 

151
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,370
me to make any kind of contact with Josh
without moving without taking a step

152
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:33,380
without moving without taking a step
 

153
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,040
without moving without taking a step
right so that would mean that's our

154
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,050
right so that would mean that's our
 

155
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,930
right so that would mean that's our
longest signing so I can't use the time

156
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:37,940
longest signing so I can't use the time
 

157
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,850
longest signing so I can't use the time
of the hand you see way out of range for

158
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:39,860
of the hand you see way out of range for
 

159
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,979
of the hand you see way out of range for
that I can't use the time of the buffing

160
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:41,989
that I can't use the time of the buffing
 

161
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,020
that I can't use the time of the buffing
I can we board as far as possible and I

162
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,030
I can we board as far as possible and I
 

163
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,570
I can we board as far as possible and I
still can't reach Josh I have to use the

164
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,580
still can't reach Josh I have to use the
 

165
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,430
still can't reach Josh I have to use the
time of the foot in order to get to Josh

166
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
time of the foot in order to get to Josh
 

167
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,350
time of the foot in order to get to Josh
to make some kind of contact now when

168
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,360
to make some kind of contact now when
 

169
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,430
to make some kind of contact now when
we're talking about sword I'll show you

170
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
we're talking about sword I'll show you
 

171
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,990
we're talking about sword I'll show you
how we set that was sort but it's the

172
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000
how we set that was sort but it's the
 

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,610
how we set that was sort but it's the
same basic idea now

174
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:54,620
same basic idea now
 

175
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,250
same basic idea now
if Josh can always keep himself at the

176
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,260
if Josh can always keep himself at the
 

177
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,990
if Josh can always keep himself at the
time of the foot and he's worried about

178
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,000
time of the foot and he's worried about
 

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
time of the foot and he's worried about
defense he's worried about me making

180
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,010
defense he's worried about me making
 

181
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,380
defense he's worried about me making
lightning-fast attacks

182
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,390
lightning-fast attacks
 

183
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,210
lightning-fast attacks
he'll probably always have a reaction

184
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,220
he'll probably always have a reaction
 

185
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,370
he'll probably always have a reaction
time enough of the extra time that he

186
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,380
time enough of the extra time that he
 

187
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,839
time enough of the extra time that he
can get out of the range of that right

188
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:07,849
can get out of the range of that right
 

189
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,300
can get out of the range of that right
so he could probably move his foot every

190
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,310
so he could probably move his foot every
 

191
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,949
so he could probably move his foot every
time right so meaning if I come into

192
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
time right so meaning if I come into
 

193
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,599
time right so meaning if I come into
touch Josh right now he can move his

194
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:13,609
touch Josh right now he can move his
 

195
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:14,650
touch Josh right now he can move his
foot out of the way so I'm gonna come in

196
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:14,660
foot out of the way so I'm gonna come in
 

197
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,509
foot out of the way so I'm gonna come in
and get this guy okay you can see I

198
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:16,519
and get this guy okay you can see I
 

199
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,949
and get this guy okay you can see I
moved my foot but he had another

200
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:17,959
moved my foot but he had another
 

201
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,810
moved my foot but he had another
reaction time that he can also move his

202
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:19,820
reaction time that he can also move his
 

203
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,520
reaction time that he can also move his
foot that's great he had max from

204
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,530
foot that's great he had max from
 

205
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,830
foot that's great he had max from
reaction time but let's say I'm a little

206
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
reaction time but let's say I'm a little
 

207
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,900
reaction time but let's say I'm a little
faster than Josh so if I was a little

208
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:25,910
faster than Josh so if I was a little
 

209
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,819
faster than Josh so if I was a little
bit faster than josh josh could still

210
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:27,829
bit faster than josh josh could still
 

211
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,160
bit faster than josh josh could still
generally move his body out of the way

212
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,170
generally move his body out of the way
 

213
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,840
generally move his body out of the way
so as I come in he can move that body

214
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:31,850
so as I come in he can move that body
 

215
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,310
so as I come in he can move that body
out of the way and this is what you see

216
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,320
out of the way and this is what you see
 

217
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,470
out of the way and this is what you see
in prize fighters right when you see

218
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,480
in prize fighters right when you see
 

219
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,030
in prize fighters right when you see
someone coming at him and they're moving

220
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
someone coming at him and they're moving
 

221
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,500
someone coming at him and they're moving
their waist like this to get out of the

222
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:38,510
their waist like this to get out of the
 

223
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,759
their waist like this to get out of the
way so they're bobbing and weaving to

224
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:39,769
way so they're bobbing and weaving to
 

225
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,050
way so they're bobbing and weaving to
get out of the way that and that's

226
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,060
get out of the way that and that's
 

227
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,670
get out of the way that and that's
because they can still move their body

228
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:42,680
because they can still move their body
 

229
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,830
because they can still move their body
faster than I can move at that range now

230
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
faster than I can move at that range now
 

231
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,449
faster than I can move at that range now
if I was even faster than that when

232
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:46,459
if I was even faster than that when
 

233
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,039
if I was even faster than that when
you're talking about anything room

234
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,049
you're talking about anything room
 

235
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,569
you're talking about anything room
particularly we talked about sword and

236
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:49,579
particularly we talked about sword and
 

237
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,039
particularly we talked about sword and
show that in just a second Josh did

238
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,049
show that in just a second Josh did
 

239
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,229
show that in just a second Josh did
still use his hands to defend himself so

240
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:53,239
still use his hands to defend himself so
 

241
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,090
still use his hands to defend himself so
here's the type of the hand so if I move

242
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,100
here's the type of the hand so if I move
 

243
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,250
here's the type of the hand so if I move
in and still use the time of the hand to

244
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,260
in and still use the time of the hand to
 

245
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,160
in and still use the time of the hand to
defend himself now that's not ideal

246
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,170
defend himself now that's not ideal
 

247
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,320
defend himself now that's not ideal
but he can still use that so meaning

248
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,330
but he can still use that so meaning
 

249
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,600
but he can still use that so meaning
that I have could be three magnitudes

250
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,610
that I have could be three magnitudes
 

251
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,030
that I have could be three magnitudes
faster than Josh and him still possibly

252
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,040
faster than Josh and him still possibly
 

253
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,370
faster than Josh and him still possibly
depends what I'm saying this is a lot to

254
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,380
depends what I'm saying this is a lot to
 

255
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,839
depends what I'm saying this is a lot to
take in so think about this for a second

256
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:09,849
take in so think about this for a second
 

257
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,180
take in so think about this for a second
my foot moves the slowest my body the

258
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,190
my foot moves the slowest my body the
 

259
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,860
my foot moves the slowest my body the
second slowest and my hand moves the

260
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:13,870
second slowest and my hand moves the
 

261
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,159
second slowest and my hand moves the
fastest so we're in a range that

262
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,169
fastest so we're in a range that
 

263
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,409
fastest so we're in a range that
requires me to take a step always my

264
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:19,419
requires me to take a step always my
 

265
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:21,870
requires me to take a step always my
slowest time then that means Josh could

266
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:21,880
slowest time then that means Josh could
 

267
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,430
slowest time then that means Josh could
have a reaction with this foot it'd be

268
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
have a reaction with this foot it'd be
 

269
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,379
have a reaction with this foot it'd be
slower than that he can have a reaction

270
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:25,389
slower than that he can have a reaction
 

271
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,840
slower than that he can have a reaction
with his body it'd be slower than that

272
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:27,850
with his body it'd be slower than that
 

273
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,670
with his body it'd be slower than that
he can have a reaction with his hands

274
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
he can have a reaction with his hands
 

275
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,800
he can have a reaction with his hands
he's giving himself the best chance to

276
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:31,810
he's giving himself the best chance to
 

277
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,960
he's giving himself the best chance to
possibly defend himself against whatever

278
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:33,970
possibly defend himself against whatever
 

279
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,670
possibly defend himself against whatever
I'll and now if we were to give our

280
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
I'll and now if we were to give our
 

281
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,300
I'll and now if we were to give our
swords movie magic okay so if we're here

282
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,310
swords movie magic okay so if we're here
 

283
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,210
swords movie magic okay so if we're here
with our swords you can see this is

284
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:42,220
with our swords you can see this is
 

285
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,920
with our swords you can see this is
again analogous to our fingertip

286
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:43,930
again analogous to our fingertip
 

287
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,900
again analogous to our fingertip
distance so the tips of our swords

288
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:45,910
distance so the tips of our swords
 

289
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,150
distance so the tips of our swords
touching is the extension of our body

290
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
touching is the extension of our body
 

291
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,670
touching is the extension of our body
right now in truth this is just a little

292
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:50,680
right now in truth this is just a little
 

293
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,770
right now in truth this is just a little
bit inside of that range but for most

294
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:52,780
bit inside of that range but for most
 

295
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,540
bit inside of that range but for most
reasons it will work right so work for

296
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,550
reasons it will work right so work for
 

297
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,200
reasons it will work right so work for
most purposes

298
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,210
most purposes
 

299
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,200
most purposes
meaning it's impossible for me to get

300
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,210
meaning it's impossible for me to get
 

301
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,900
meaning it's impossible for me to get
Josh without taking a step right so I

302
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:00,910
Josh without taking a step right so I
 

303
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,790
Josh without taking a step right so I
can take my maximum bleeding for my

304
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
can take my maximum bleeding for my
 

305
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,380
can take my maximum bleeding for my
maximum reach out and can't even reach

306
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,390
maximum reach out and can't even reach
 

307
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,670
maximum reach out and can't even reach
his fingers and you could really

308
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
his fingers and you could really
 

309
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,110
his fingers and you could really
probably give up fingers a little bit

310
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
probably give up fingers a little bit
 

311
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,100
probably give up fingers a little bit
because they all have a super they're

312
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,110
because they all have a super they're
 

313
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,290
because they all have a super they're
protecting his hand so this is analogous

314
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,300
protecting his hand so this is analogous
 

315
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,270
protecting his hand so this is analogous
to our fingertip distance which means in

316
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,280
to our fingertip distance which means in
 

317
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,610
to our fingertip distance which means in
order to get Josh I have to take a step

318
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:14,620
order to get Josh I have to take a step
 

319
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,920
order to get Josh I have to take a step
in if he's about as fast as I am and

320
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:16,930
in if he's about as fast as I am and
 

321
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,540
in if he's about as fast as I am and
able to react quickly what I think is
