even the military arts okay there's a

98
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
even the military arts okay there's a
 

99
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,669
even the military arts okay there's a
mitigation of risk it's only the the

100
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
mitigation of risk it's only the the
 

101
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,029
mitigation of risk it's only the the
civilian

102
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
civilian
 

103
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,750
civilian
who has the fantasy of

104
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
who has the fantasy of
 

105
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,630
who has the fantasy of
overwhelming with superior firepower

106
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
overwhelming with superior firepower
 

107
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,309
overwhelming with superior firepower
do you see that it's always better to

108
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
do you see that it's always better to
 

109
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,949
do you see that it's always better to
have superior firepower but to use it in

110
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
have superior firepower but to use it in
 

111
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,030
have superior firepower but to use it in
a way that you mitigated risk that is

112
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
a way that you mitigated risk that is
 

113
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,229
a way that you mitigated risk that is
much better

114
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
much better
 

115
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,550
much better
use of superior firepower

116
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
use of superior firepower
 

117
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,030
use of superior firepower
do you get it so for example uh

118
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
do you get it so for example uh
 

119
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,390
do you get it so for example uh
i i have tanks uh and i can charge up

120
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
i i have tanks uh and i can charge up
 

121
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,150
i i have tanks uh and i can charge up
this beach against all of your uh forces

122
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
this beach against all of your uh forces
 

123
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,309
this beach against all of your uh forces
and stuff but it would be much better if

124
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
and stuff but it would be much better if
 

125
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,390
and stuff but it would be much better if
i flank you with these tanks do you see

126
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
i flank you with these tanks do you see
 

127
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,270
i flank you with these tanks do you see
that and so

128
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
that and so
 

129
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,229
that and so
even in that context you mitigate for

130
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
even in that context you mitigate for
 

131
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,910
even in that context you mitigate for
the reduction of risk okay so that's

132
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
the reduction of risk okay so that's
 

133
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,110
the reduction of risk okay so that's
non-contestation is how you mitigate for

134
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
non-contestation is how you mitigate for
 

135
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,430
non-contestation is how you mitigate for
the reduction of risk and so it's only

136
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
the reduction of risk and so it's only
 

137
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,350
the reduction of risk and so it's only
the fantasy

138
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
the fantasy
 

139
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,229
the fantasy
of video game mentalities that you keep

140
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
of video game mentalities that you keep
 

141
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,750
of video game mentalities that you keep
resetting and that

142
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
resetting and that
 

143
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,750
resetting and that
denying the reality that people are

144
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
denying the reality that people are
 

145
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,550
denying the reality that people are
dying because you keep freaking trying

146
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
dying because you keep freaking trying
 

147
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,710
dying because you keep freaking trying
to overpower someone

148
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
to overpower someone
 

149
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,229
to overpower someone
do you understand that

150
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
do you understand that
 

151
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,550
do you understand that
so non-contestation

152
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
so non-contestation
 

153
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,869
so non-contestation
is is really just a martial strategy but

154
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
is is really just a martial strategy but
 

155

very direct ways
of gaining

358
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039

or
takamusu aiki because then they'll work

takamusu aiki because then they'll work
 

365
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,390
takamusu aiki because then they'll work
on the technical things

366
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
on the technical things
 

367
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,790
on the technical things
okay but i'm telling you you you're

368
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
okay but i'm telling you you you're
 

369
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,390
okay but i'm telling you you you're
better off you

prioritizing these other practices

374
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879

 

375
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,629

because they go deeper

376
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
because they go deeper
 

377
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,629
because they go deeper
because they have less

378
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
because they have less
 

379
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,790
because they have less
allowance for deviation

380
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800

 

381
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,309

then working on

382
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
then working on
 

383
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,150
then working on
technical things

384
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160

 

385
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,589

but

386
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
but
 

387
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,350
but
our technical curriculum is lined up

388
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
our technical curriculum is lined up
 

389
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,710
our technical curriculum is lined up
towards

390
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
towards
 

391
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,150
towards
these three markers okay

392
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
these three markers okay
 

393
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,830
these three markers okay
and they are the following you have to

394
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
and they are the following you have to
 

395
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,469
and they are the following you have to
have kihon wasan

396
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
have kihon wasan
 

397
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,790
have kihon wasan
and kihon mazda is

398
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
and kihon mazda is
 

399
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,710
and kihon mazda is
a ritual

400
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
a ritual
 

401
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,749
a ritual
for everyone does their prescribed role

402

for everyone does their prescribed role
 

403
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,550
for everyone does their prescribed role
it is pure prescription

404
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
it is pure prescription
 

405
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,550
it is pure prescription
but it's prescription in those three

406
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
but it's prescription in those three
 

407
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,070
but it's prescription in those three
markers

408
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
markers
 

409
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,029
markers
you see

410
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
you see
 

411
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,149
you see
so it's not any kind of ritual it's an

423
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,350

from there we have micro drilling

424
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
from there we have micro drilling
 

425
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,389
from there we have micro drilling
when micro drilling we're going to take

426
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
when micro drilling we're going to take
 

427
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,590
when micro drilling we're going to take
segments or sections out of the kihon

428
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
segments or sections out of the kihon
 

429
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,750
segments or sections out of the kihon
waza to focus in on those parts only but

430
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
waza to focus in on those parts only but
 

431
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,070
waza to focus in on those parts only but
we're doing it for the purposes of those

432
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
we're doing it for the purposes of those
 

433
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,030
we're doing it for the purposes of those
three markers

434
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040

 

435
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,509

so for example

436
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
so for example
 

437
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,389
so for example
in the last class

438
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
in the last class
 

439

you cannot

452
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
you cannot
 

453
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,750
you cannot
deconstruct it

454
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
deconstruct it
 

455
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,470

you're in an antagonistic relationship

456
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
you're in an antagonistic relationship
 

457
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,310

with the person

458
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
with the person
 

459
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,310
with the person
that you're trying to control because

463
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,590

so what we did is we just pulled that

464
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
so what we did is we just pulled that
 

465
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,949
so what we did is we just pulled that
part out

466
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
part out
 

467
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,790

release
from this

472
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
from this
 

473
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,030
from this
antagonism

474
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
antagonism
 

475
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,190
antagonism
toward what end toward deconstructing

476
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
toward what end toward deconstructing
 

477
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,670
toward what end toward deconstructing
the ego tripartite and getting yourself

478
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
the ego tripartite and getting yourself
 

479
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,630
the ego tripartite and getting yourself
out of this dichotomous reality

480
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
out of this dichotomous reality
 

481
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,910
out of this dichotomous reality
we just focused on that

482
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920

 

483
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,829

and with the with the goal as i said

484
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839

 

485
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,910

if you're doing it right an observer

486
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
if you're doing it right an observer
 

487
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,030

you see
those are micro drills but they're aimed

502
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
those are micro drills but they're aimed
 

503
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,949
those are micro drills but they're aimed
towards these three markers

504
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959

 

505

the next level because you're moving
towards those three markers so for

508

towards those three markers so for
 

509
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,430
towards those three markers so for
example you're moving towards takamusai

510

but you can only compete
 

555
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,190
but you can only compete
with the two sides of the form

do you understand okay
so

560
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240

 

561
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,870

some of the ways it comes up at first is

562
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
some of the ways it comes up at first is
 

563
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,870
some of the ways it comes up at first is
you're going to increase the speed and

564
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
you're going to increase the speed and
 

565
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,110
you're going to increase the speed and
the strength of the moose

566
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
the strength of the moose
 

567
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,990
the strength of the moose
okay

568
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
okay
 

569
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,670
okay
but you're going to find that when you

570
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
but you're going to find that when you
 

571
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,269
but you're going to find that when you
get with someone's skill that can

572
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
get with someone's skill that can
 

573
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,310
get with someone's skill that can
actually do the form

574
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320

 

575
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,949

you're going to need these other aspects

576
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
you're going to need these other aspects
 

577
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,870
you're going to need these other aspects
you're going to need that mystical state

578
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
you're going to need that mystical state
 

579
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,509
you're going to need that mystical state
you're going to need the i can cook you

580
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
you're going to need the i can cook you
 

581

you're going to need the i can cook you
you get it because you'll just lose over

582
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
you get it because you'll just lose over
 

583
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,030
you get it because you'll just lose over
and over and over again okay

584
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040

 

585
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,470

so again to

586
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
so again to
 

587
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,590
so again to
summarize

588
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
summarize
 

589
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,670
summarize
you're both competing

590
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
you're both competing
 

591
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,269
you're both competing
against each other

592
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
against each other
 

593
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,190
against each other
but with the form

594
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
but with the form
 

595
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,030
but with the form
with the goal of knocking the other one

596
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
with the goal of knocking the other one
 

597
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,710
with the goal of knocking the other one
out of the form

598
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
out of the form
 

599
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,629
out of the form
okay and this this requires that you

600
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
okay and this this requires that you
 

601
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,350
okay and this this requires that you
start freeing yourself from the form

602
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
start freeing yourself from the form
 

603
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,829
start freeing yourself from the form
and that is going to require

604
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
and that is going to require
 

605
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,230
and that is going to require
that your first mind aspect is

606
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
that your first mind aspect is
 

607
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,990
that your first mind aspect is
deconstructed

608
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
deconstructed
 

609
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,190
deconstructed
okay

610
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
okay
 

611
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,910
okay
some other things come up

612
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
some other things come up
 

613
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,790
some other things come up
that don't come up in quinoa maza

614
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
that don't come up in quinoa maza
 

615
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,990
that don't come up in quinoa maza
if you're doing kiwi masala incorrectly

616
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
if you're doing kiwi masala incorrectly
 

617
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,910
if you're doing kiwi masala incorrectly
so

618
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
so
 

619
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,750
so
when you're in the second mind aspect

620
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
when you're in the second mind aspect
 

621
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,629
when you're in the second mind aspect
there cannot be fear in you

622
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
there cannot be fear in you
 

623
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,030
there cannot be fear in you
okay

624
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040

 

625
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,949

and so

626
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
and so
 

627
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,389
and so
there should not be

628
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
there should not be
 

629
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,629
there should not be
contestation in you because that's a

630
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
contestation in you because that's a
 

631
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,949
contestation in you because that's a
fear response do you understand

632
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
fear response do you understand
 

633
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,030
fear response do you understand
well as we do now

634
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
well as we do now
 

635
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,069
well as we do now

an overt competition if i was already in
 

637
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,389
an overt competition if i was already in
a fear state

638
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
a fear state
 

639
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,110
a fear state
in kihonza and i was already contesting

640
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
in kihonza and i was already contesting
 

641
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,550
in kihonza and i was already contesting
because i was existing dichotomously

642
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
because i was existing dichotomously

646
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
and you're going to see the downside
 

647
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,670
and you're going to see the downside
and the inability of the first mind

648
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
and the inability of the first mind
 

649
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,629
and the inability of the first mind

in combat engagement environments it
 

657
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,870
in combat engagement environments it
just can't function

your moves
 

815
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,270
your moves
but when you're competing against

out of
 

821
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,830
out of
slow down their

822
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
slow down their
 

823
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,870
slow down their
moves okay

to get it
 

845
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,750
to get it
or another one

846
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
or another one
 

847
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,950
or another one
angle of deflections

848
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
angle of deflections
 

849
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,669
angle of deflections
always appear to work

850
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
always appear to work
 

851
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,710
always appear to work
you see

852
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
you see
 

853
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,390
you see
because we always imagine that we're

854
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
because we always imagine that we're
 

855
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,470
because we always imagine that we're
strong enough to do it

856
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
strong enough to do it
 

857
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,789
strong enough to do it
but in in weapons work angle of

858
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
but in in weapons work angle of
 

859
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,190
but in in weapons work angle of
deflections are too slow

860
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
deflections are too slow
 

861
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,350
deflections are too slow
they're way too slow

862
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
they're way too slow
 

863
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,150
they're way too slow
it's not just that you if as i always

864
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
it's not just that you if as i always
 

865
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,310
it's not just that you if as i always
say if you're strong enough it'll work

866
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
say if you're strong enough it'll work
 

867
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,710
say if you're strong enough it'll work
it but there's always like as weapons

868
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
it but there's always like as weapons
 

869
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,909
it but there's always like as weapons
aren't involved

870
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
aren't involved
 

871
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,150
aren't involved
okay

872
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
okay
 

873
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,909
okay
so you're going to find out that your

874
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
so you're going to find out that your
 

875
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,590
so you're going to find out that your
your angle of deflections just they

876
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
your angle of deflections just they
 

877
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,990
your angle of deflections just they
don't work not only because they might

it will delay
 

905
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029

keyhole
 

1027
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,550

some of the things you're going to

1032
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
some of the things you're going to
 

1033
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,310
some of the things you're going to
notice is you see there's an angle of

1034
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
notice is you see there's an angle of
 

1035
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,029
notice is you see there's an angle of
deflection in there did you see it so i

1036
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
deflection in there did you see it so i
 

1037
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,549
deflection in there did you see it so i
came here

1038
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
came here
 

1039
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,669
came here
boom

boom
 

1041
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,510
boom
and again that's not going to work

1042
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
and again that's not going to work
 

1043
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,870
and again that's not going to work
so i'm getting rid of the angle of
