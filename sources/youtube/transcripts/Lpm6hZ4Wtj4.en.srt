00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200

 

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,509

We want to look at

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:14,519
We want to look at
 

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:24,990
We want to look at
something. So, come on over

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,000

 

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,230

here. Okay. Right now, you two in

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,240
here. Okay. Right now, you two in
 

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,510
here. Okay. Right now, you two in
particular are

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:32,520
particular are
 

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,630
particular are
um getting a little more dynamic

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,640

 

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,709

understanding of where the center is,

14
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
understanding of where the center is,
 

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,790
understanding of where the center is,
how to ground vector and how to project.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
how to ground vector and how to project.
 

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,549
how to ground vector and how to project.
Okay, it's a step you have to get there.

18
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559

 

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,029

Now we want to

20
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
Now we want to
 

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,270
Now we want to
understand

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,280
understand
 

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,910
understand
consciously what I had you just zeroing

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
consciously what I had you just zeroing
 

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,869
consciously what I had you just zeroing
in on feeling. Okay.

26
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:01,879
in on feeling. Okay.
 

27
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,149
in on feeling. Okay.
Um you want definitely a

28
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
Um you want definitely a
 

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,390
Um you want definitely a
kinesthetic sense of what you're doing.

30
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
kinesthetic sense of what you're doing.
 

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,469
kinesthetic sense of what you're doing.
That has to be there. That's why we

32
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
That has to be there. That's why we
 

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,670
That has to be there. That's why we
prioritized it. But you also consciously

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
prioritized it. But you also consciously
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,310
prioritized it. But you also consciously
want to

36
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,320
want to
 

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,550
want to
understand what you're doing. Why is it

38
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
understand what you're doing. Why is it
 

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,710
understand what you're doing. Why is it
working? Etc.

40
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
working? Etc.
 

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,230
working? Etc.
because in tactical situations that

42
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
because in tactical situations that
 

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,950
because in tactical situations that
might become necessary. Okay. So let us

44
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
might become necessary. Okay. So let us
 

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,149
might become necessary. Okay. So let us
we're going to do the following

46
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
we're going to do the following
 

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,310
we're going to do the following
discovery

48
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
discovery
 

49
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,590
discovery
learning. Okay. We have

50
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:34,600
learning. Okay. We have
 

51
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,550
learning. Okay. We have
our cross.

52
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
our cross.
 

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,590
our cross.
And what you'll

54
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,600
And what you'll
 

55
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,950
And what you'll
notice is at the

56
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
notice is at the
 

57
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,310
notice is at the
uh

58
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
uh
 

59
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,429
uh
180 energy that's coming in from UK, if

60
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
180 energy that's coming in from UK, if
 

61
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,590
180 energy that's coming in from UK, if
you project it back on the

62
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
you project it back on the
 

63
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,749
you project it back on the
180, it's

64
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:56,759
180, it's
 

65
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,270
180, it's
doable and you get a kind of violent

66
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
doable and you get a kind of violent
 

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,950
doable and you get a kind of violent
uh reaction when the rebounding energy

68
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
uh reaction when the rebounding energy
 

69
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,309
uh reaction when the rebounding energy
overrides their yong aspect. But if you

70
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
overrides their yong aspect. But if you
 

71
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,790
overrides their yong aspect. But if you
pay

72
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:09,800
pay
 

73
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,110
pay
attention, while that exact contact

74
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,120
attention, while that exact contact
 

75
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,949
attention, while that exact contact
moment is kind of percussive and

76
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
moment is kind of percussive and
 

77
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,910
moment is kind of percussive and
violent, there's not much displacement

78
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
violent, there's not much displacement
 

79
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,110
violent, there's not much displacement
factor to it. Uh, and the reason for

80
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
factor to it. Uh, and the reason for
 

81
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,229
factor to it. Uh, and the reason for
that is because of how we're generating

82
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
that is because of how we're generating
 

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,750
that is because of how we're generating
the rebounding energy. So the ukas yang

84
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
the rebounding energy. So the ukas yang
 

85
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,229
the rebounding energy. So the ukas yang
aspect is coming into us and for us to

86
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
aspect is coming into us and for us to
 

87
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,670
aspect is coming into us and for us to
go back forward it has to continually

88
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
go back forward it has to continually
 

89
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,030
go back forward it has to continually
come into us. So there's a kind of

90
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
come into us. So there's a kind of
 

91
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,750
come into us. So there's a kind of
energy leakage that is happening because

92
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
energy leakage that is happening because
 

93
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,790
energy leakage that is happening because
we never go to the bracing angle where

94
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
we never go to the bracing angle where
 

95
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,710
we never go to the bracing angle where
we start just shoving it all this way.

96
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
we start just shoving it all this way.
 

97
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,350
we start just shoving it all this way.
as we're moving this way, there's still

98
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
as we're moving this way, there's still
 

99
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,150
as we're moving this way, there's still
some of their yong aspect coming through

100
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
some of their yong aspect coming through
 

101
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,030
some of their yong aspect coming through
us otherwise we're not doing it. Okay?

102
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
us otherwise we're not doing it. Okay?
 

103
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,550
us otherwise we're not doing it. Okay?
And that leads to that

104
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,560
And that leads to that
 

105
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,710
And that leads to that
delay. When we rotate the cross so to

106
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:07,720
delay. When we rotate the cross so to
 

107
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,270
delay. When we rotate the cross so to
speak, we are very interested in these

108
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
speak, we are very interested in these
 

109
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,509
speak, we are very interested in these
diagonals. Okay?

110
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519

 

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,990

And if we call this

112
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
And if we call this
 

113
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,630
And if we call this
like the highest yong, as you start to

114
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
like the highest yong, as you start to
 

115
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,509
like the highest yong, as you start to
move around, you're going to enter

116
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
move around, you're going to enter
 

117
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,710
move around, you're going to enter
towards the yin

118
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720

 

119
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,190

phase. Okay? And this has an impact on

120
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
phase. Okay? And this has an impact on
 

121
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,149
phase. Okay? And this has an impact on
how much displacement we get on their

122
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
how much displacement we get on their
 

123
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,309
how much displacement we get on their
base when we're coq projecting. Okay?

124
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
base when we're coq projecting. Okay?
 

125
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,990
base when we're coq projecting. Okay?
What you'll notice is as you

126
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,000
What you'll notice is as you
 

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,110
What you'll notice is as you
as you start to move this way, it

128
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
as you start to move this way, it
 

129
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,550
as you start to move this way, it
becomes less violent, less percussive at

130
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
becomes less violent, less percussive at
 

131
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,270
becomes less violent, less percussive at
the contact point. But because we're not

132
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
the contact point. But because we're not
 

133
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,309
the contact point. But because we're not
subject to that internalization of what

134
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
subject to that internalization of what
 

135
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,630
subject to that internalization of what
we're projecting, you actually get

136
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
we're projecting, you actually get
 

137
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,309
we're projecting, you actually get
better projection out at this

138
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,319
better projection out at this
 

139
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,309
better projection out at this
45. Okay?

140
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
45. Okay?
 

141
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,910
45. Okay?
And what we doing here when we spiral

142
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:10,920
And what we doing here when we spiral
 

143
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,030
And what we doing here when we spiral
rotate the UK is not going this way and

144
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
rotate the UK is not going this way and
 

145
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,069
rotate the UK is not going this way and
then I hit them at that way is that we

146
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
then I hit them at that way is that we
 

147
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,830
then I hit them at that way is that we
are actually bringing the UK this way.

148
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
are actually bringing the UK this way.
 

149
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,230
are actually bringing the UK this way.
And so we're really hitting them at the

150
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,240
And so we're really hitting them at the
 

151
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,870
And so we're really hitting them at the
90 even though it's a 45. Okay? And

152
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
90 even though it's a 45. Okay? And
 

153
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,870
90 even though it's a 45. Okay? And
that's key. And we're doing that every

154
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
that's key. And we're doing that every
 

155
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,590
that's key. And we're doing that every
time because this is UK's path in in

156
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
time because this is UK's path in in
 

157
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,710
time because this is UK's path in in
iikido.

158
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
iikido.
 

159
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,390
iikido.
Okay.

160
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
Okay.
 

161
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,310
Okay.
Um,

162
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,320
Um,
 

163
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,790
Um,
however, because we're at this 45,

164
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
however, because we're at this 45,
 

165
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,430
however, because we're at this 45,
there's still some of this pure yang

166
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
there's still some of this pure yang
 

167
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,990
there's still some of this pure yang
uh coming towards us. There's still some

168
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
uh coming towards us. There's still some
 

169
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,469
uh coming towards us. There's still some
energy going this way. And as we come

170
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
energy going this way. And as we come
 

171
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,670
energy going this way. And as we come
around, that pure yong starts to get

172
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
around, that pure yong starts to get
 

173
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,110
around, that pure yong starts to get
less and less. Okay? And so when we do

174
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
less and less. Okay? And so when we do
 

175
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,710
less and less. Okay? And so when we do
when we hit we bring UK around to this

176
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
when we hit we bring UK around to this
 

177
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,950
when we hit we bring UK around to this
uh 90° and we hit at this 90° you're

178
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
uh 90° and we hit at this 90° you're
 

179
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,430
uh 90° and we hit at this 90° you're
going to see that there's not as much

180
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
going to see that there's not as much
 

181
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,270
going to see that there's not as much
displacement value uh as we're coming

182
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,280
displacement value uh as we're coming
 

183
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,230
displacement value uh as we're coming
along and then it'll get decreased as we

184
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
along and then it'll get decreased as we
 

185
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,469
along and then it'll get decreased as we
start now projecting along or toward or

186
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
start now projecting along or toward or
 

187
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,390
start now projecting along or toward or
with that 180°ree yong. uh because we

188
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
with that 180°ree yong. uh because we
 

189
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,350
with that 180°ree yong. uh because we
don't have the oppositional energy to

190
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
don't have the oppositional energy to
 

191
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,469
don't have the oppositional energy to
ground off of and to project with. So

192
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
ground off of and to project with. So
 

193
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,590
ground off of and to project with. So
this is going to be a weaker energy uh

194
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
this is going to be a weaker energy uh
 

195
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,629
this is going to be a weaker energy uh
line and this will be also a weaker

196
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
line and this will be also a weaker
 

197
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,950
line and this will be also a weaker
energy line. This will be the weakest.

198
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
energy line. This will be the weakest.
 

199
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,629
energy line. This will be the weakest.
Um there'll be little projection here.

200
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:41,639
Um there'll be little projection here.
 

201
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,950
Um there'll be little projection here.
Okay. And then it'll start to go back

202
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay. And then it'll start to go back
 

203
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,830
Okay. And then it'll start to go back
towards its uh yang phase. And uh here

204
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
towards its uh yang phase. And uh here
 

205
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,749
towards its uh yang phase. And uh here
again at this 45 as we brought their

206
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
again at this 45 as we brought their
 

207
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,790
again at this 45 as we brought their
energy around you will repeat the cycle.

208
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
energy around you will repeat the cycle.
 

209
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,350
energy around you will repeat the cycle.
Okay. Again you are actually projecting

210
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay. Again you are actually projecting
 

211
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,029
Okay. Again you are actually projecting
at a 90° angle but they're at a 45°

212
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
at a 90° angle but they're at a 45°
 

213
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,230
at a 90° angle but they're at a 45°
angle to that 180 line. And here is

214
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
angle to that 180 line. And here is
 

215
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,029
angle to that 180 line. And here is
another major uh 90° projection

216
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,039
another major uh 90° projection
 

217
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,870
another major uh 90° projection
point. And then same thing will happen.

218
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
point. And then same thing will happen.
 

219
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,029
point. And then same thing will happen.
it'll get a little weaker and a little

220
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
it'll get a little weaker and a little
 

221
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,430
it'll get a little weaker and a little
weaker and then you're back where you

222
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
weaker and then you're back where you
 

223
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,430
weaker and then you're back where you
have that kind of weirdness where you're

224
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
have that kind of weirdness where you're
 

225
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,150
have that kind of weirdness where you're
both projecting what you're

226
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,160
both projecting what you're
 

227
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,469
both projecting what you're
internalizing. Okay. And this is this

228
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
internalizing. Okay. And this is this
 

229
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,629
internalizing. Okay. And this is this
these are uh the key points. This is

230
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
these are uh the key points. This is
 

231
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,550
these are uh the key points. This is
where we here in sensient iikido this is

232
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
where we here in sensient iikido this is
 

233
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,510
where we here in sensient iikido this is
all things being equal. We will either

234
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
all things being equal. We will either
 

235
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,629
all things being equal. We will either
project here right or right or left side

236
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
project here right or right or left side
 

237
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,550
project here right or right or left side
here or here or we'll bring you past the

238
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:41,560
here or here or we'll bring you past the
 

239
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,309
here or here or we'll bring you past the
6:00 and we will be at one of these

240
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
6:00 and we will be at one of these
 

241
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,189
6:00 and we will be at one of these
depending you're left or right. Okay.

242
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:48,199
depending you're left or right. Okay.
 

243
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,550
depending you're left or right. Okay.
Careful never if you're if you're

244
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
Careful never if you're if you're
 

245
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,590
Careful never if you're if you're
bringing them around this way

246
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:52,600
bringing them around this way
 

247
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,110
bringing them around this way
counterclockwise careful that's about

248
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
counterclockwise careful that's about
 

249
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,110
counterclockwise careful that's about
your limit of where you can go on the

250
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
your limit of where you can go on the
 

251
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,990
your limit of where you can go on the
90. Uh the these are a waste of time.

252
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
90. Uh the these are a waste of time.
 

253
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,430
90. Uh the these are a waste of time.
there's not enough uh internalized yong

254
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
there's not enough uh internalized yong

you start to get into your momentum

258
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
you start to get into your momentum
 

259
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,629
you start to get into your momentum
throws down here. Okay. So, we're going

260
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
throws down here. Okay. So, we're going
 

261
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,469
throws down here. Okay. So, we're going
to do some discovery learning so you

262
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
to do some discovery learning so you
 

263
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,469
to do some discovery learning so you
could feel that. But you're going to

264
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
could feel that. But you're going to
 

265
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,230
could feel that. But you're going to
consciously

266
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
consciously
 

267
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,469
consciously
um I want you to keep with the

268
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
um I want you to keep with the
 

269
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,150
um I want you to keep with the
kinesthetic awareness of what you're

270
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
kinesthetic awareness of what you're
 

271
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,350
kinesthetic awareness of what you're
doing, but I want you to consciously

272
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,360
doing, but I want you to consciously
 

273
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,230
doing, but I want you to consciously
understand where my feet need to be in

274
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
understand where my feet need to be in
 

275
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,510
understand where my feet need to be in

276
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
relation to their stance to capitalize

upon the energy benefits of this angle.

278
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
upon the energy benefits of this angle.
 

279
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,830
upon the energy benefits of this angle.
Okay, we'll work with this angle first,

280
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
Okay, we'll work with this angle first,
 

281
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,510
Okay, we'll work with this angle first,
but we'll do all these so you'll feel

282
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
but we'll do all these so you'll feel
 

283
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,029
but we'll do all these so you'll feel
the difference. Okay. Um, and then we'll

284
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
the difference. Okay. Um, and then we'll
 

285
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,749
the difference. Okay. Um, and then we'll
task ourselves

286
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:42,759
task ourselves
 

287
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,710
task ourselves
with making their line of gravity go

288
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
with making their line of gravity go
 

289
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,430
with making their line of gravity go
outside their base of support. Okay. And

290
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
outside their base of support. Okay. And
 

291
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,749
outside their base of support. Okay. And
so again here, this one, if we look at

292
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
so again here, this one, if we look at
 

293
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,029
so again here, this one, if we look at
at these angles from that task, line of

294
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
at these angles from that task, line of
 

295
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,029
at these angles from that task, line of
gravity outside the base of support,

296
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
gravity outside the base of support,
 

297
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,670
gravity outside the base of support,
it's very easy for the UK to put their

298
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
it's very easy for the UK to put their
 

299
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,589
it's very easy for the UK to put their
base of support back under because they

300
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
base of support back under because they
 

301
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,629
base of support back under because they
just walk backwards. But when they're

302
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
just walk backwards. But when they're
 

303
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,589
just walk backwards. But when they're
being brought this way, uh, the line of

304
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
being brought this way, uh, the line of
 

305
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,710
being brought this way, uh, the line of
gravity will fall outside the base of

306
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
gravity will fall outside the base of
 

307
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,430
gravity will fall outside the base of
support more easily and because they're

308
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
support more easily and because they're
 

309
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,230
support more easily and because they're
moving forward, they can't really get

310
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
moving forward, they can't really get
 

311
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,430
moving forward, they can't really get
themselves into that position. Okay. Uh,

312
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
themselves into that position. Okay. Uh,
 

313
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,510
themselves into that position. Okay. Uh,
so let's look at this now. All right.

314
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
so let's look at this now. All right.
 

315
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,749
so let's look at this now. All right.
So first to uh demonstrate how because

316
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
So first to uh demonstrate how because
 

317
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,430
So first to uh demonstrate how because
of that uh

318
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,440
of that uh
 

319
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,230
of that uh
simultaneous internalization with the

320
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,240
simultaneous internalization with the
 

321
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,149
simultaneous internalization with the
projection there's a kind of uh

322
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
projection there's a kind of uh
 

323
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,949
projection there's a kind of uh
sluggishness to what's happening because

324
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
sluggishness to what's happening because
 

325
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,110
sluggishness to what's happening because
there's a I mean in essence there's a

326
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
there's a I mean in essence there's a
 

327
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,149
there's a I mean in essence there's a
kind of not all energy is going in in

328
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
kind of not all energy is going in in
 

329
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,949
kind of not all energy is going in in
one direction okay and the oppositional

330
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
one direction okay and the oppositional
 

331
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,389
one direction okay and the oppositional
force is simultaneously

332
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:51,399
force is simultaneously
 

333
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,949
force is simultaneously
being internalized as it is being

334
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
being internalized as it is being
 

335
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,750
being internalized as it is being
outvalued and it leads to some

336
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
outvalued and it leads to some
 

337
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,230
outvalued and it leads to some
weirdness. Then you also will see that

338
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
weirdness. Then you also will see that
 

339
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,389
weirdness. Then you also will see that
all all he has to do is is walk

340
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
all all he has to do is is walk
 

341
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,230
all all he has to do is is walk
backwards and his base of support is

342
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
backwards and his base of support is
 

343
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,030
backwards and his base of support is
there. So we'll work on that 180. He's

344
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
there. So we'll work on that 180. He's
 

345
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,350
there. So we'll work on that 180. He's
just going to come in and we'll just

346
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,360
just going to come in and we'll just
 

347
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,430
just going to come in and we'll just
do and and you could see like there's a

348
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
do and and you could see like there's a
 

349
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,949
do and and you could see like there's a
kind of and then the percussion happens.

350
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
kind of and then the percussion happens.
 

351
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,070
kind of and then the percussion happens.
Do you see? And then all he's doing is

352
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
Do you see? And then all he's doing is
 

353
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,310
Do you see? And then all he's doing is
walking back out. He He'll have his

354
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
walking back out. He He'll have his
 

355
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,790
walking back out. He He'll have his
balance. It's not

356
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
balance. It's not
 

357
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,430
balance. It's not
that difficult to do. Okay. And we'll

358
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
that difficult to do. Okay. And we'll
 

359
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,070
that difficult to do. Okay. And we'll
have Virginia feel what I'm talking

360
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,080

 

361
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,110

about right

362
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,120

 

363
00:09:40,120 --> 00:10:07,269

here. Okay. I'll have you guys try.

364
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279

 

365
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,230

Okay. uh with the line of gravity aspect

366
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
Okay. uh with the line of gravity aspect
 

367
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,389
Okay. uh with the line of gravity aspect
of it. If you pay she yes she is

368
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
of it. If you pay she yes she is
 

369
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,350
of it. If you pay she yes she is
preoccupied with the rebounding force

370
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
preoccupied with the rebounding force
 

371
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,230
preoccupied with the rebounding force
but

372
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,240
but
 

373
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,630
but
um and we do do that a lot but it's not

374
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
um and we do do that a lot but it's not
 

375
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,550
um and we do do that a lot but it's not
a combination of preoccupy preoccupation

376
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
a combination of preoccupy preoccupation
 

377
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,949
a combination of preoccupy preoccupation
with the rebounding energy plus the

378
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:27,959
with the rebounding energy plus the
 

379
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,310
with the rebounding energy plus the
kazushi. Okay, those aren't the same

380
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
kazushi. Okay, those aren't the same
 

381
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,030
kazushi. Okay, those aren't the same
thing. And so you'll see that yes, she's

382
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,040
thing. And so you'll see that yes, she's
 

383
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,269
thing. And so you'll see that yes, she's
preoccupied, but her line of gravity is

384
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
preoccupied, but her line of gravity is
 

385
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,430
preoccupied, but her line of gravity is
constantly inside her base of support.

386
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
constantly inside her base of support.
 

387
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,870
constantly inside her base of support.
Okay? And so the more athletic people,

388
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
Okay? And so the more athletic people,
 

389
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,790
Okay? And so the more athletic people,
uh, they can recover from that

390
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
uh, they can recover from that
 

391
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,190
uh, they can recover from that
preoccupation with the rebounding energy

392
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
preoccupation with the rebounding energy
 

393
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,710
preoccupation with the rebounding energy
quite quickly. Okay? Um, like like I

394
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
quite quickly. Okay? Um, like like I
 

395
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,350
quite quickly. Okay? Um, like like I
know Ronin is basically you you get one

396
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
know Ronin is basically you you get one
 

397
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,829
know Ronin is basically you you get one
step and a half a step and he's back in

398
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
step and a half a step and he's back in
 

399
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,990
step and a half a step and he's back in
the game. Okay? someone super athletic

400
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
the game. Okay? someone super athletic
 

401
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,509
the game. Okay? someone super athletic
and coordinated is going to be able to

402
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:00,519
and coordinated is going to be able to
 

403
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,310
and coordinated is going to be able to
do. All right. So now we'll go to the

404
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,320
do. All right. So now we'll go to the
 

405
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,630
do. All right. So now we'll go to the
90. And so that means I have to bring

406
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
90. And so that means I have to bring
 

407
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,829
90. And so that means I have to bring
her into the curve. Okay. And when I

408
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
her into the curve. Okay. And when I
 

409
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,230
her into the curve. Okay. And when I
bring her into the curve and I preoccupy

410
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
bring her into the curve and I preoccupy
 

411
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,590
bring her into the curve and I preoccupy
her with her intention, like her initial

412
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
her with her intention, like her initial
 

413
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,269
her with her intention, like her initial
assault intention, uh her initial 180

414
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
assault intention, uh her initial 180
 

415
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,030
assault intention, uh her initial 180
degree

416
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
degree
 

417
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,269
degree
uh yong aspect, and I start to bring it

418
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
uh yong aspect, and I start to bring it
 

419
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,110
uh yong aspect, and I start to bring it
into a turn. Stay there, please.

420
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,120
into a turn. Stay there, please.
 

421
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,829
into a turn. Stay there, please.
Her base is very

422
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:28,839
Her base is very
 

423
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,350
Her base is very
narrow. So, I only need her line of

424
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
narrow. So, I only need her line of
 

425
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,870
narrow. So, I only need her line of
gravity to get out a tiny bit. And

426
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
gravity to get out a tiny bit. And
 

427
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,750
gravity to get out a tiny bit. And
because she's going forward, she's not

428
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
because she's going forward, she's not
 

429
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,990
because she's going forward, she's not
going to be able to keep her base

430
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
going to be able to keep her base
 

431
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,910
going to be able to keep her base
underneath her line of gravity like when

432
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
underneath her line of gravity like when
 

433
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,870
underneath her line of gravity like when
she's going backwards. Okay? And you'll

434
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
she's going backwards. Okay? And you'll
 

435
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,550
she's going backwards. Okay? And you'll
see that there's none of that

436
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
see that there's none of that
 

437
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,829
see that there's none of that
sluggishness where she's came in. It's

438
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
sluggishness where she's came in. It's
 

439
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,710
sluggishness where she's came in. It's
all being internalized until it goes

440
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
all being internalized until it goes
 

441
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,949
all being internalized until it goes
back out. Okay? It's more it's more

442
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:55,959
back out. Okay? It's more it's more
 

443
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,389
back out. Okay? It's more it's more
immediate and you can see she's more

444
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
immediate and you can see she's more
 

445
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,910
immediate and you can see she's more
stumbling

446
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
stumbling
 

447
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,030
stumbling
etc. We're just doing

448
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,040
etc. We're just doing
 

449
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,630
etc. We're just doing
small

450
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:03,640
small
 

451
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,230
small
projections so you could feel that it

452
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
projections so you could feel that it
 

453
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,829
projections so you could feel that it
doesn't matter which way you

454
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:10,839

 

455
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,430

go. The hand work doesn't

456
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,440

 

457
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,590

matter. Okay. So, I'll have you feel

458
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
matter. Okay. So, I'll have you feel
 

459
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:50,990
matter. Okay. So, I'll have you feel
that 90, that first 45 degree angle.

460
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000

 

461
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,670

Chris. Okay. So now, yes, the maximum

462
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
Chris. Okay. So now, yes, the maximum
 

463
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,750
Chris. Okay. So now, yes, the maximum
yong

464
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:56,760
yong
 

465
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,150
yong
aspect that I can internalize and

466
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
aspect that I can internalize and
 

467
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,110
aspect that I can internalize and
rebound out is the 180. However, as I

468
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
rebound out is the 180. However, as I
 

469
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,509
rebound out is the 180. However, as I
said already, you lose some of it

470
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
said already, you lose some of it
 

471
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,030
said already, you lose some of it
because you're simultaneously

472
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
because you're simultaneously
 

473
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,870
because you're simultaneously
internalizing what you're trying to

474
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
internalizing what you're trying to
 

475
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,949
internalizing what you're trying to
outvalue. when we go to the 45 degree

476
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
outvalue. when we go to the 45 degree
 

477
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,150
outvalue. when we go to the 45 degree
angle as we bring them into the into the

478
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
angle as we bring them into the into the
 

479
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,509
angle as we bring them into the into the
spiral uh I get a lot of that

480
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
spiral uh I get a lot of that
 

481
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,150
spiral uh I get a lot of that
oppositional energy the yang aspect that

482
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
oppositional energy the yang aspect that
 

483
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,069
oppositional energy the yang aspect that
I'm

484
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:23,079
I'm
 

485
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm
internalizing and I don't have the

486
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
internalizing and I don't have the
 

487
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,550
internalizing and I don't have the
problem of inter internalizing

488
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
problem of inter internalizing
 

489
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,110
problem of inter internalizing
simultaneously what I'm trying to

490
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
simultaneously what I'm trying to
 

491
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,430
simultaneously what I'm trying to
outvalue plus I have the benefit that

492
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
outvalue plus I have the benefit that
 

493
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,790
outvalue plus I have the benefit that
his base is narrow to the projection

494
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
his base is narrow to the projection
 

495
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,750
his base is narrow to the projection
line and his line of gravity falls out

496
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
line and his line of gravity falls out
 

497
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,710
line and his line of gravity falls out
easily outside that base of support. As

498
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
easily outside that base of support. As
 

499
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,790
easily outside that base of support. As
we start

500
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:43,800
we start
 

501
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,389
we start
going around the clock, you get less of

502
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
going around the clock, you get less of
 

503
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,629
going around the clock, you get less of
the 180° yong aspect. So, there's less

504
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
the 180° yong aspect. So, there's less
 

505
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,030
the 180° yong aspect. So, there's less
to internalize. So, then there'll be

506
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
to internalize. So, then there'll be
 

507
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,910
to internalize. So, then there'll be
less to rebound, and that's what I want

508
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
less to rebound, and that's what I want
 

509
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,310
less to rebound, and that's what I want
you to feel. Okay? So, you're going to

510
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
you to feel. Okay? So, you're going to
 

511
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,710
you to feel. Okay? So, you're going to
still have the line of gravity based of

512
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
still have the line of gravity based of
 

513
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,790
still have the line of gravity based of
support benefit as you come around on

514
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
support benefit as you come around on
 

515
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,829
support benefit as you come around on
the spiral, but your projection ability

516
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
the spiral, but your projection ability
 

517
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,189
the spiral, but your projection ability
or your projection potential is lower

518
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
or your projection potential is lower
 

519
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,150
or your projection potential is lower
because you're now less oppositional to

520
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
because you're now less oppositional to
 

521
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,710
because you're now less oppositional to
the yong aspect. Here's the true 180.

522
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
the yong aspect. Here's the true 180.
 

523
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,350
the yong aspect. Here's the true 180.
Okay. So, we going to do the 90 and

524
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
Okay. So, we going to do the 90 and
 

525
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,949
Okay. So, we going to do the 90 and
you'll feel how Yeah. less less energy

526
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
you'll feel how Yeah. less less energy
 

527
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,350
you'll feel how Yeah. less less energy
coming coming out. Okay. Does he still

528
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
coming coming out. Okay. Does he still
 

529
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,150
coming coming out. Okay. Does he still
lose his balance? Yes. But there's way

530
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
lose his balance? Yes. But there's way
 

531
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,269
lose his balance? Yes. But there's way
less energy on my

532
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,279
less energy on my
 

533
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,750
less energy on my
part. You you can feel that. Okay. So, I

534
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
part. You you can feel that. Okay. So, I
 

535
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,590
part. You you can feel that. Okay. So, I
want you guys to try that. Move around

536
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
want you guys to try that. Move around
 

537
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,509
want you guys to try that. Move around
the clock. And we're we're going this

538
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
the clock. And we're we're going this
 

539
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,870
the clock. And we're we're going this
way. So, as we move to 8:00, we are less

540
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
way. So, as we move to 8:00, we are less
 

541
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,949
way. So, as we move to 8:00, we are less
oppositional to the original young

542
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
oppositional to the original young
 

543
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,389
oppositional to the original young
aspect. So, there'll be less to

544
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
aspect. So, there'll be less to
 

545
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,910
aspect. So, there'll be less to
internalize. There'll be less to

546
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
internalize. There'll be less to
 

547
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,470
internalize. There'll be less to
project. Okay? And you'll feel ah it's

548
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
project. Okay? And you'll feel ah it's
 

549
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,389
project. Okay? And you'll feel ah it's
kind of leaking out all over the place.

550
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
kind of leaking out all over the place.
 

551
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,310
kind of leaking out all over the place.
Okay? So, I'm bringing her into the

552
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
Okay? So, I'm bringing her into the
 

553
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,269
Okay? So, I'm bringing her into the
spiral and I hit this angle there. And

554
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
spiral and I hit this angle there. And
 

555
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,030
spiral and I hit this angle there. And
you're going to feel like I'm I'm having

556
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
you're going to feel like I'm I'm having
 

557
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,189
you're going to feel like I'm I'm having
to push more with my hands. I'm going

558
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
to push more with my hands. I'm going
 

559
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,509
to push more with my hands. I'm going
have I have to do more external stuff as

560
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
have I have to do more external stuff as
 

561
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,590
have I have to do more external stuff as
opposed to here. Boom. There's not

562
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
opposed to here. Boom. There's not
 

563
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,829
opposed to here. Boom. There's not
there's less on my hands. As I start

564
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
there's less on my hands. As I start
 

565
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,430
there's less on my hands. As I start
coming out here, she's going with me. Uh

566
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
coming out here, she's going with me. Uh
 

567
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,069
coming out here, she's going with me. Uh
don't stop like don't don't act for me.

568
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
don't stop like don't don't act for me.
 

569
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,389
don't stop like don't don't act for me.
Okay? You you have to evolve past this

570
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
Okay? You you have to evolve past this
 

571
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,470
Okay? You you have to evolve past this
need to perform. Do you understand? All

572
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
need to perform. Do you understand? All
 

573
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,269
need to perform. Do you understand? All
you have to do is grab and push. That's

574
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
you have to do is grab and push. That's
 

575
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,910
you have to do is grab and push. That's
all you do. And you keep your grip.

576
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
all you do. And you keep your grip.
 

577
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,389
all you do. And you keep your grip.
Don't try to predict what I'm doing.

578
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
Don't try to predict what I'm doing.
 

579
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,150
Don't try to predict what I'm doing.
There we go. And you can see that now

580
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
There we go. And you can see that now
 

581
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,670
There we go. And you can see that now
I'm really just accelerating her. And

582
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm really just accelerating her. And
 

583
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,550
I'm really just accelerating her. And
you'll get the benefit of the athletic

584
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
you'll get the benefit of the athletic
 

585
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,310
you'll get the benefit of the athletic
people will be able to just uh get their

586
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,320
people will be able to just uh get their
 

587
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,910
people will be able to just uh get their
base back under their line of gravity.

588
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
base back under their line of gravity.
 

589
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,590
base back under their line of gravity.
So, we'll switch roles. Your knees

590
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
So, we'll switch roles. Your knees
 

591
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,069
So, we'll switch roles. Your knees
jacked

592
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,079
jacked
 

593
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,269
jacked
up. Okay. You're going to take me to

594
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
up. Okay. You're going to take me to
 

595
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,269
up. Okay. You're going to take me to
that

596
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:50,279

 

597
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,949

corner. And I don't ever really go off

598
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
corner. And I don't ever really go off
 

599
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,949
corner. And I don't ever really go off
balance. Does that make sense? If you do

600
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
balance. Does that make sense? If you do
 

601
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,189
balance. Does that make sense? If you do
this 45, you'll see the line of gravity

602
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:00,199
this 45, you'll see the line of gravity
 

603
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,110
this 45, you'll see the line of gravity
benefit. We're here and yes, it goes

604
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
benefit. We're here and yes, it goes
 

605
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,710
benefit. We're here and yes, it goes
outside my base of support. Okay. And so

606
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
outside my base of support. Okay. And so
 

607
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,629
outside my base of support. Okay. And so
a lot of times in

608
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:09,639
a lot of times in
 

609
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,590
a lot of times in
iikido, we we think the

610
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,600
iikido, we we think the
 

611
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,350
iikido, we we think the
acceleration because now I'm going with

612
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
acceleration because now I'm going with
 

613
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,269
acceleration because now I'm going with
the 180, you see, is beneficial. But

614
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
the 180, you see, is beneficial. But
 

615
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,110
the 180, you see, is beneficial. But
there's just no kazushi in it for

616
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
there's just no kazushi in it for
 

617
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,670
there's just no kazushi in it for
anybody that's athletic or is actually

618
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
anybody that's athletic or is actually
 

619
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,069
anybody that's athletic or is actually
fighting with you. So, uh, if she's

620
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
fighting with you. So, uh, if she's
 

621
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,350
fighting with you. So, uh, if she's
going to take me that way again, okay,

622
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
going to take me that way again, okay,
 

623
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,150
going to take me that way again, okay,
to that

624
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,160
to that
 

625
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,790
to that
corner and you're you're the second you

626
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
corner and you're you're the second you
 

627
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,389
corner and you're you're the second you
feel it, I'm off. Do you see? So, that's

628
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
feel it, I'm off. Do you see? So, that's
 

629
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,470
feel it, I'm off. Do you see? So, that's
where I can feel her accelerating me.

630
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
where I can feel her accelerating me.
 

631
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,509
where I can feel her accelerating me.
And you'll see that's where people just

632
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:42,519
And you'll see that's where people just
 

633
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,590
And you'll see that's where people just
change release.

634
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
change release.
 

635
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,550
change release.
Whereas if she goes to this way, by the

636
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
Whereas if she goes to this way, by the
 

637
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,470
Whereas if she goes to this way, by the
time I feel it, it already got me. Okay,

638
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
time I feel it, it already got me. Okay,
 

639
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:24,110
time I feel it, it already got me. Okay,
make sense? Okay, try it.

640
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,120

 

641
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,429

Right. And

642
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
Right. And
 

643
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,549
Right. And
so, not only do you lose that line of

644
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:29,559
so, not only do you lose that line of
 

645
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,230
so, not only do you lose that line of
gravity benefit, like you're immediately

646
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
gravity benefit, like you're immediately
 

647
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,029
gravity benefit, like you're immediately
out of it, okay? and you're moving away

648
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
out of it, okay? and you're moving away
 

649
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,870
out of it, okay? and you're moving away
from the acceleration throws. You have

650
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
from the acceleration throws. You have
 

651
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,150
from the acceleration throws. You have
to understand like why do we go to the

652
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
to understand like why do we go to the
 

653
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,909
to understand like why do we go to the
acceleration throws? We go to the

654
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
acceleration throws? We go to the
 

655
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,669
acceleration throws? We go to the
acceleration throws because we don't

656
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
acceleration throws because we don't
 

657
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,710
acceleration throws because we don't
have the ability to internalize the yong

658
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
have the ability to internalize the yong
 

659
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,710
have the ability to internalize the yong
aspect. So, we get out of the way of the

660
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
aspect. So, we get out of the way of the
 

661
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,870
aspect. So, we get out of the way of the
yong aspect. Okay? Uh meaning like I I

662
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
yong aspect. Okay? Uh meaning like I I
 

663
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,310
yong aspect. Okay? Uh meaning like I I
could be here all the time and do that.

664
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
could be here all the time and do that.
 

665
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,669
could be here all the time and do that.
I don't have the inability to do that.

666
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
I don't have the inability to do that.
 

667
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,909
I don't have the inability to do that.
Why don't I do it is because I want

668
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
Why don't I do it is because I want
 

669
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,150
Why don't I do it is because I want
these other benefits. But it doesn't

670
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
these other benefits. But it doesn't
 

671
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,390
these other benefits. But it doesn't
mean that I'm going to go to these

672
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
mean that I'm going to go to these
 

673
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,630
mean that I'm going to go to these
angles because

674
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
angles because
 

675
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,150
angles because
uh they don't work. And I'm definitely

676
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
uh they don't work. And I'm definitely
 

677
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,310
uh they don't work. And I'm definitely
not having to go to those angles because

678
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
not having to go to those angles because
 

679
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,710
not having to go to those angles because
I can't internalize the yong aspect.

680
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
I can't internalize the yong aspect.
 

681
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,630
I can't internalize the yong aspect.
Okay. So the the most yin angle and the

682
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay. So the the most yin angle and the
 

683
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,350
Okay. So the the most yin angle and the
most accelerating angle is you let it

684
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
most accelerating angle is you let it
 

685
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,909
most accelerating angle is you let it
all go by and you go you go that way.

686
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
all go by and you go you go that way.
 

687
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,830
all go by and you go you go that way.
Okay. Um

688
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:28,840
Okay. Um
 

689
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,630
Okay. Um
again you the

690
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:31,640
again you the
 

691
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,190
again you the
nag we doing this and this behavior that

692
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
nag we doing this and this behavior that
 

693
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,990
nag we doing this and this behavior that
the that the UK does is uh cultural like

694
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
the that the UK does is uh cultural like
 

695
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,150
the that the UK does is uh cultural like
the guy told you to hold on and you held

696
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
the guy told you to hold on and you held
 

697
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,230
the guy told you to hold on and you held
on. Okay. So you're here and you're

698
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,240
on. Okay. So you're here and you're
 

699
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,510
on. Okay. So you're here and you're
like but no one does that.

700
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
like but no one does that.
 

701
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,270
like but no one does that.
Okay.

702
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280
Okay.
 

703
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,909
Okay.
So the uk that is here feels that and

704
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
So the uk that is here feels that and
 

705
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,350
So the uk that is here feels that and
you're just here.

706
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,360
you're just here.
 

707
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,190
you're just here.
Okay.

708
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,200
Okay.
 

709
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,510
Okay.
Um so it's a no no. Okay. And want to

710
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
Um so it's a no no. Okay. And want to
 

711
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,230
Um so it's a no no. Okay. And want to
understand why do we tend to do it? Why

712
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
understand why do we tend to do it? Why
 

713
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,710
understand why do we tend to do it? Why
don't we want to do it? Okay. Is the is

714
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
don't we want to do it? Okay. Is the is
 

715
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,110
don't we want to do it? Okay. Is the is
the reason being. So I

716
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
the reason being. So I
 

717
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,350
the reason being. So I
understand that you are here and then

718
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
understand that you are here and then
 

719
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,950
understand that you are here and then
you're moving him but that's not

720
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
you're moving him but that's not
 

721
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,669
you're moving him but that's not
projection. That's just you getting out

722
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
projection. That's just you getting out
 

723
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,750
projection. That's just you getting out
of the

724
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:22,760
of the
 

725
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,190
of the
way and pushing him with the inertia

726
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
way and pushing him with the inertia
 

727
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,990
way and pushing him with the inertia
that was coming in. So you gota you got

728
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
that was coming in. So you gota you got
 

729
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,830
that was coming in. So you gota you got
to understand what I mean when I say

730
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
to understand what I mean when I say
 

731
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,950
to understand what I mean when I say
your projection potential goes down.

732
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
your projection potential goes down.
 

733
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,750
your projection potential goes down.
It's not that he can't be made to go

734
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
It's not that he can't be made to go
 

735
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,710
It's not that he can't be made to go
that way. You see that? It's is he being

736
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
that way. You see that? It's is he being
 

737
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,990
that way. You see that? It's is he being
made to go a certain angle through the

738
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
made to go a certain angle through the
 

739
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,830
made to go a certain angle through the
rebounding energy or not? Okay. And when

740
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
rebounding energy or not? Okay. And when
 

741
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,950
rebounding energy or not? Okay. And when
we take him here, there's abs there's no

742
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
we take him here, there's abs there's no
 

743
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,750
we take him here, there's abs there's no
rebounding energy. There's just a new

744
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
rebounding energy. There's just a new
 

745
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:16,390
rebounding energy. There's just a new
energy that's happening. Okay, try it.

746
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400

 

747
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,350

So to make this point, if I'm here,

748
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,360
So to make this point, if I'm here,
 

749
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,150
So to make this point, if I'm here,
boom, my arms don't move. If I do the

750
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,160
boom, my arms don't move. If I do the
 

751
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,789
boom, my arms don't move. If I do the
other one, my arms don't move. He

752
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
other one, my arms don't move. He
 

753
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,950
other one, my arms don't move. He
doesn't go anywhere. There's no

754
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
doesn't go anywhere. There's no
 

755
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,350
doesn't go anywhere. There's no
rebounding energy in that. Okay. And now

756
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
rebounding energy in that. Okay. And now
 

757
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,750
rebounding energy in that. Okay. And now
we'll come back up. So when you bring

758
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
we'll come back up. So when you bring
 

759
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,789
we'll come back up. So when you bring
them around this way, you you you can

760
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
them around this way, you you you can
 

761
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,630
them around this way, you you you can
see that you're starting the

762
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:41,640
see that you're starting the
 

763
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,510
see that you're starting the
new 180. It's just like she came in from

764
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
new 180. It's just like she came in from
 

765
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,190
new 180. It's just like she came in from
this angle. Okay. So when you're

766
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
this angle. Okay. So when you're
 

767
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,390
this angle. Okay. So when you're
bringing her around this way, the energy

768
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
bringing her around this way, the energy
 

769
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,750
bringing her around this way, the energy
that's coming back now can be grounded

770
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
that's coming back now can be grounded
 

771
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,990
that's coming back now can be grounded
and projected again. Do do you guys see

772
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
and projected again. Do do you guys see
 

773
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,310
and projected again. Do do you guys see
that?

774
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,320
that?
 

775
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,390
that?
So here's the max, but it has that

776
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
So here's the max, but it has that
 

777
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,549
So here's the max, but it has that
weirdness that you're simultaneously

778
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
weirdness that you're simultaneously
 

779
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,590
weirdness that you're simultaneously
internalizing as you're trying to

780
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:06,600
internalizing as you're trying to
 

781
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,669
internalizing as you're trying to
outvalue. Here I am just simply uh

782
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:10,679
outvalue. Here I am just simply uh
 

783
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,909
outvalue. Here I am just simply uh
internalizing and it doesn't have that

784
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:12,919
internalizing and it doesn't have that
 

785
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,630
internalizing and it doesn't have that
simultaneity. So you'll get the

786
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
simultaneity. So you'll get the
 

787
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,190
simultaneity. So you'll get the
projection plus the benefit of her

788
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
projection plus the benefit of her
 

789
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,870
projection plus the benefit of her
narrow base. And here you're absorbing

790
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
narrow base. And here you're absorbing
 

791
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,230
narrow base. And here you're absorbing
less yong aspect because you're now 90

792
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
less yong aspect because you're now 90
 

793
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,110
less yong aspect because you're now 90
degrees to its original intention.

794
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
degrees to its original intention.
 

795
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,390
degrees to its original intention.
Right? And as we come back to these

796
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,400
Right? And as we come back to these
 

797
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,549
Right? And as we come back to these
angles, there's no there's none. Okay?

798
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
angles, there's no there's none. Okay?
 

799
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,430
angles, there's no there's none. Okay?
It's often because you're going with it.

800
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
It's often because you're going with it.
 

801
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,990
It's often because you're going with it.
And then this would be the worst one.

802
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
And then this would be the worst one.
 

803
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,789
And then this would be the worst one.
But as you bring her back around, then

804
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
But as you bring her back around, then
 

805
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,110
But as you bring her back around, then
she's coming back forward. Do you see?

806
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
she's coming back forward. Do you see?
 

807
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,789
she's coming back forward. Do you see?
And that now is what

808
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:45,799
And that now is what
 

809
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,029
And that now is what
you can project again. And that's why we

810
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
you can project again. And that's why we
 

811
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,870
you can project again. And that's why we
use that angle, that angle, and we're

812
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
use that angle, that angle, and we're
 

813
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,070
use that angle, that angle, and we're
just constantly working those diagonals

814
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
just constantly working those diagonals
 

815
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:13,270
just constantly working those diagonals
as we go around. Okay. So, try this one.

816
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280

 

817
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,190

All right. I don't have the mic on.

818
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
All right. I don't have the mic on.
 

819
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,029
All right. I don't have the mic on.
We're just We got to make this detail.

820
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
We're just We got to make this detail.
 

821
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,789
We're just We got to make this detail.
We're running out of time. Okay. To get

822
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:19,799
We're running out of time. Okay. To get
 

823
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,270
We're running out of time. Okay. To get
someone around

824
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,280
someone around
 

825
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,950
someone around
6:00 and to be going that

826
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:25,960
6:00 and to be going that
 

827
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,630
6:00 and to be going that
way. This is and this is where I want to

828
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
way. This is and this is where I want to
 

829
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,990
way. This is and this is where I want to
go with this eventually. The I adhesion

830
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
go with this eventually. The I adhesion
 

831
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,350
go with this eventually. The I adhesion
hand now becomes relevant. When you're

832
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
hand now becomes relevant. When you're
 

833
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,549
hand now becomes relevant. When you're
on the positive side of the circle, they

834
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
on the positive side of the circle, they
 

835
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,630
on the positive side of the circle, they
can both be projection hands, which is

836
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
can both be projection hands, which is
 

837
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,270
can both be projection hands, which is
where you guys are at, but you need to

838
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
where you guys are at, but you need to
 

839
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,310
where you guys are at, but you need to
get the adhesion part. Okay. So, as he's

840
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
get the adhesion part. Okay. So, as he's
 

841
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,870
get the adhesion part. Okay. So, as he's
coming in, this hand has to start

842
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:49,880
coming in, this hand has to start
 

843
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,149
coming in, this hand has to start
adhering and be able to bring him around

844
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
adhering and be able to bring him around
 

845
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,630
adhering and be able to bring him around
the horn, so to speak. Okay? And it's

846
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
the horn, so to speak. Okay? And it's
 

847
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,669
the horn, so to speak. Okay? And it's
that energy that now gives the

848
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
that energy that now gives the
 

849
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,630
that energy that now gives the
projection energy. Okay? So, you can't

850
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
projection energy. Okay? So, you can't
 

851
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,630
projection energy. Okay? So, you can't
go

852
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:03,640
go
 

853
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,870
go
here and do two projection energies

854
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
here and do two projection energies
 

855
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,710
here and do two projection energies
because that's going to be still y. It's

856
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
because that's going to be still y. It's
 

857
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,310
because that's going to be still y. It's
going to be an extension of those

858
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
going to be an extension of those
 

859
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,590
going to be an extension of those
problem angles. Okay? So this hand has

860
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
problem angles. Okay? So this hand has
 

861
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,230
problem angles. Okay? So this hand has
to go this way and then that man can go

862
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
to go this way and then that man can go
 

863
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,789
to go this way and then that man can go
that way. So you have to have the I

864
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:21,799
that way. So you have to have the I
 

865
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,350
that way. So you have to have the I
adhesion plus the ku projector. Okay. So

866
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
adhesion plus the ku projector. Okay. So
 

867
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,919
adhesion plus the ku projector. Okay. So
let's try it again.
