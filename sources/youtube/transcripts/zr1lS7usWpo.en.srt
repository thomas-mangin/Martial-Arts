1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,149

okay

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,159
okay
 

3
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,789
okay
oh we did this one right

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799

 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,270

and i'm going to take her right into the

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
and i'm going to take her right into the
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,789
and i'm going to take her right into the
technique

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799

 

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,670

i'm not taking her down anymore but i'm

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
i'm not taking her down anymore but i'm
 

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,070
i'm not taking her down anymore but i'm
using this whole thing

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080

 

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,109

to do the same level of

14
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119

 

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:37,270

a control thing right into it

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280

 

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,389

i'm not going to tilt her

18
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
i'm not going to tilt her
 

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,709
i'm not going to tilt her
i'm turning her whole body

20
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
i'm turning her whole body
 

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,869
i'm turning her whole body
you don't have to do anything i'll do it

22
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
you don't have to do anything i'll do it
 

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,229
you don't have to do anything i'll do it
turn her whole body

24
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239

 

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,229

you know she's not going down anymore

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
you know she's not going down anymore
 

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,110
you know she's not going down anymore
right

28
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
right
 

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:05,350
right
they turned her whole body i'm gonna

30
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360

 

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,190

doesn't matter if you go fast or slow

32
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
doesn't matter if you go fast or slow
 

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,670
doesn't matter if you go fast or slow
slow as you can harder like move the

34
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
slow as you can harder like move the
 

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,190
slow as you can harder like move the
whole body around

36
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200

 

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,630

okay

38
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
okay
 

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,749
okay
let's try it

40
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
let's try it
 

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,230
let's try it
um

42
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240

 

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,030

what

44
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
what
 

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,190
what
so we remember when we were doing the

46
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
so we remember when we were doing the
 

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,590
so we remember when we were doing the
drill right that i'm

48
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
drill right that i'm
 

49
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,230
drill right that i'm
in your center you see i'm in her center

50
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
in your center you see i'm in her center
 

51
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,550
in your center you see i'm in her center
even as i start to turn i'm not just

52
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
even as i start to turn i'm not just
 

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,230
even as i start to turn i'm not just
yielding you see

54
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
yielding you see
 

55
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,190
yielding you see
uh and i'm using the outward spiral dc

56
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
uh and i'm using the outward spiral dc
 

57
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,590
uh and i'm using the outward spiral dc
so it's always in her center always in

58
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
so it's always in her center always in
 

59
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,310
so it's always in her center always in
the center oh i'm floating around the

60
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
the center oh i'm floating around the
 

61
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,550
the center oh i'm floating around the
edge here i'm gonna go from two hands

62
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
edge here i'm gonna go from two hands
 

63
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,469
edge here i'm gonna go from two hands
right the two hands are gonna move you

64
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
right the two hands are gonna move you
 

65
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,429
right the two hands are gonna move you
you see

66
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
you see
 

67
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,429
you see
okay

68
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
okay
 

69
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,230
okay
so

70
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
so
 

71
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,230
so
in the center in the center in the

72
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
in the center in the center in the
 

73
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,870
in the center in the center in the
center boom the two hands move till i

74
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
center boom the two hands move till i
 

75
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,910
center boom the two hands move till i
transition to these two hand position

76
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
transition to these two hand position
 

77
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,350
transition to these two hand position
you see uh so this is what's controlling

78
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
you see uh so this is what's controlling
 

79
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,510
you see uh so this is what's controlling
her okay i don't want to break her

80
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
her okay i don't want to break her
 

81
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,389
her okay i don't want to break her
center i'm gonna move her center that's

82
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
center i'm gonna move her center that's
 

83
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,469
center i'm gonna move her center that's
what i'm doing okay we'll get back where

84
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
what i'm doing okay we'll get back where
 

85
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,389
what i'm doing okay we'll get back where
we were

86
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
we were
 

87
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,710
we were
you know okay and now what i'm going to

88
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
you know okay and now what i'm going to
 

89
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,350
you know okay and now what i'm going to
do is instead of the shape where i took

90
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
do is instead of the shape where i took
 

91
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,869
do is instead of the shape where i took
her down i'm going to take her into the

92
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
her down i'm going to take her into the
 

93
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,630
her down i'm going to take her into the
back outward kazushi which is

94
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
back outward kazushi which is
 

95
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,430
back outward kazushi which is
okay

96
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
okay
 

97
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,350
okay
so i'm gonna move her body in a way

98
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
so i'm gonna move her body in a way
 

99
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,309
so i'm gonna move her body in a way
that i get that shape there it is

100
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
that i get that shape there it is
 

101
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,630
that i get that shape there it is
you guys see that

102
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
you guys see that
 

103
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,350
you guys see that
what i don't want to do

104
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
what i don't want to do
 

105
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,509
what i don't want to do
is bend her over

106
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
is bend her over
 

107
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,430
is bend her over
and pull her back

108
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
and pull her back
 

109
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,949
and pull her back
and then

110
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
and then
 

111
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,190
and then
do that technique

112
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
do that technique
 

113
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,990
do that technique
no matter how i do that i don't want to

114
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
no matter how i do that i don't want to
 

115
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,070
no matter how i do that i don't want to
do that i don't want to enter in the

116
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
do that i don't want to enter in the
 

117
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,030
do that i don't want to enter in the
back right and then

118
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
back right and then
 

119
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,589
back right and then
get her casey like i don't want to do

120
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
get her casey like i don't want to do
 

121
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,150
get her casey like i don't want to do
that and that's

122
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
that and that's
 

123
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,509
that and that's
clash

124
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
clash
 

125
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,949
clash
if you pay attention i'm basically doing

126
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
if you pay attention i'm basically doing
 

127
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,589
if you pay attention i'm basically doing
her whole center so she's going to go

128
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
her whole center so she's going to go
 

129
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,710
her whole center so she's going to go
forward

130
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
forward
 

131
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,390
forward
and then into the figure eight and into

132
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
and then into the figure eight and into
 

133
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,790
and then into the figure eight and into
the back outward kazushi but i have to

134
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
the back outward kazushi but i have to
 

135
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,790
the back outward kazushi but i have to
move her whole center there it is right

136
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
move her whole center there it is right
 

137
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,309
move her whole center there it is right
there

138
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
there
 

139
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,949
there
okay

140
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959

 

141
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,830

again you can kind of you do all kinds

142
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
again you can kind of you do all kinds
 

143
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,229
again you can kind of you do all kinds
of weird things with this it looks like

144
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
of weird things with this it looks like
 

145
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,630
of weird things with this it looks like
how much going on

146
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
how much going on
 

147
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,949
how much going on
but she can feel

148
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
but she can feel
 

149
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,910
but she can feel
that her whole body full the whole body

150
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
that her whole body full the whole body
 

151
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,830
that her whole body full the whole body
is moving okay

152
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
is moving okay
 

153
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,949
