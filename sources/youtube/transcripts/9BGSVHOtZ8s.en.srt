1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,080

so we're going to do a little experiment

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,090

 

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,700

make sure you're close enough to get

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:10,710
make sure you're close enough to get
 

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,510
make sure you're close enough to get
that we're gonna see if we can combine

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
that we're gonna see if we can combine
 

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,179
that we're gonna see if we can combine
more the podcast with the videos and to

8
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:23,189
more the podcast with the videos and to
 

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,380
more the podcast with the videos and to
see if you

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,390

of thing and this will give us another

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:36,830
of thing and this will give us another
 

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,180
of thing and this will give us another
opportunity to go back into ETO and

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,190
opportunity to go back into ETO and
 

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,720
opportunity to go back into ETO and
further refine our technique

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:45,730

 

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,299

and to give you more perspective so a

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:49,309
and to give you more perspective so a
 

21
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,479
and to give you more perspective so a
little talking at first we're going to

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:52,489
little talking at first we're going to
 

23
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,630
little talking at first we're going to
start looking at the technique through

24
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:55,640
start looking at the technique through
 

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,380
start looking at the technique through
Union Theory okay why why well the

26
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:02,390
Union Theory okay why why well the
 

27
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,899
Union Theory okay why why well the
technique was designed through Union

28
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:04,909
technique was designed through Union
 

29
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,070
technique was designed through Union
theory and what is the benefit of this

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,080
theory and what is the benefit of this
 

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,980
theory and what is the benefit of this
kind of investigation is I can

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:11,990
kind of investigation is I can
 

33
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,380
kind of investigation is I can
reverse-engineer all the crap that has

37
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,620
become Aikido through the decades by
seeing if it is consistent with Union

38
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:23,630
seeing if it is consistent with Union
 

39
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,249
seeing if it is consistent with Union
Theory just like any kind of reason

40
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:27,259
Theory just like any kind of reason
 

41
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,330

should look for a different way of doing

46
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:36,229
should look for a different way of doing
 

47
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,499
should look for a different way of doing
the technique do you understand

48
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:38,509
the technique do you understand
 

49
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:41,710
the technique do you understand
so the techniques were designed that way

50
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:41,720
so the techniques were designed that way
 

51
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,859
so the techniques were designed that way
no one really knows how far back young

60
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,570
divination magic-based ritual text but
 

61
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,940
divination magic-based ritual text but
there's problems with that

62
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:06,950
there's problems with that

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,740
there's problems with that
interpretation even though that is the

aging is somewhere six or seven BCE okay

70
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,049
aging is somewhere six or seven BCE okay
 

71
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,470
aging is somewhere six or seven BCE okay
now in the aging it was not called yin

72
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
now in the aging it was not called yin
 

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,440
now in the aging it was not called yin
and Yan but you can't see the philosophy

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,450
and Yan but you can't see the philosophy
 

75
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,949
and Yan but you can't see the philosophy
there actually the words designations

76
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
there actually the words designations
 

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,360
there actually the words designations
there were used was firm and yielding

78
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,370
there were used was firm and yielding
 

79
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,050
there were used was firm and yielding
which is very close to some of the

80
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,060
which is very close to some of the
 

81
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,090
which is very close to some of the
meanings that we use when we talk about

82
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,100
meanings that we use when we talk about
 

83
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,500
meanings that we use when we talk about
kokyo and I

84

85
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,399

so what is eun-young some basic premises

86
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:51,409
so what is eun-young some basic premises
 

87
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:56,080
so what is eun-young some basic premises
here yet yong is not a philosophy it is

language games like Vic and Stein might

94
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,129
language games like Vic and Stein might
 

95
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,750
language games like Vic and Stein might
have reached what meaning is and what's

96
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:10,760
have reached what meaning is and what's
 

97
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,960
have reached what meaning is and what's
not meaning and that kind of stuff it

98
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:13,970
not meaning and that kind of stuff it
 

99
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,420
not meaning and that kind of stuff it
was what did not what do I experience in

100
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,430
was what did not what do I experience in
 

101
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,740
was what did not what do I experience in
the world and then okay this seems to be

102
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:20,750
the world and then okay this seems to be
 

103
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,589
the world and then okay this seems to be
consistent with that some underlying

104
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
consistent with that some underlying
 

105
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,960
consistent with that some underlying
premises that we'll discuss here and

106
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:25,970
premises that we'll discuss here and
 

107
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,930
premises that we'll discuss here and
then we'll discuss more the complex ones

108
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:28,940
then we'll discuss more the complex ones
 

109
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,809
then we'll discuss more the complex ones
in the podcast is that human beings have

110
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:34,819
in the podcast is that human beings have
 

111
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,830
in the podcast is that human beings have
a special status in that they can both

112
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:38,840
a special status in that they can both
 

113
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,050
a special status in that they can both
go against Union theory or they can go

114
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,060
go against Union theory or they can go
 

115
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,380
go against Union theory or they can go
with it which means that you can up

116
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,390
with it which means that you can up
 

117
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,550
with it which means that you can up
or not up okay and that is why we

118
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:51,560
or not up okay and that is why we
 

119
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,949
or not up okay and that is why we
are interested in reverse engineering

120
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:53,959
are interested in reverse engineering

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,370
misunderstanding and that's probably
 

195
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,300
misunderstanding and that's probably
what led to the current versions of

John Deere okay all right let's try to
get there okay so again if this is a

328
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,370
get there okay so again if this is a
 

329
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,390
get there okay so again if this is a
physiological skill it's also

330
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,400
physiological skill it's also
 

331
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,090
physiological skill it's also
psychological because if if he triggers

332
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,100
psychological because if if he triggers
 

333
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,510
psychological because if if he triggers
me with fear or threat and internally I

334
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,520
me with fear or threat and internally I
 

335
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,670
me with fear or threat and internally I
will have tension and then I don't have

336
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:12,680
will have tension and then I don't have
 

337
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,810
will have tension and then I don't have
you know okay but there is a huge

338
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:15,820
you know okay but there is a huge
 

339
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,170
you know okay but there is a huge
physiological component to it that we

340
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,180
physiological component to it that we
 

341
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,020
physiological component to it that we
tackle by releasing it and relaxing okay

342
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,030
tackle by releasing it and relaxing okay
 

343
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,780
tackle by releasing it and relaxing okay
but how come I'm not flying backwards

344
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:25,790
but how come I'm not flying backwards
 

345
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,600
but how come I'm not flying backwards
how come it's not really there is a

346
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,610
how come it's not really there is a
 

347
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,460
how come it's not really there is a
human component but where's the young

348
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:33,470
human component but where's the young
 

349
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,780
human component but where's the young
component yes the ground and so to the

350
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:37,790
component yes the ground and so to the
 

351
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,290
component yes the ground and so to the
herbs he's yet do you understand that

352
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,300
herbs he's yet do you understand that
 

353
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,860
herbs he's yet do you understand that
because relative to me maybe he's young

354
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:44,870
because relative to me maybe he's young
 

355
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,010
because relative to me maybe he's young
but relative to the earth he's young

356
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,020
but relative to the earth he's young
 

357
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,400
but relative to the earth he's young
he's that he's a speck of dust okay so

358
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,410
he's that he's a speck of dust okay so
 

359
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,900
he's that he's a speck of dust okay so
that's what I'm doing here is I'm

360
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:52,910
that's what I'm doing here is I'm
 

361
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,780
that's what I'm doing here is I'm
triggering triggering the ground okay so

362
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,790
triggering triggering the ground okay so
 

363
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,040
triggering triggering the ground okay so
we're going to same thing you I want you

364
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,050
we're going to same thing you I want you
 

365
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,560
we're going to same thing you I want you
to see

366
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,570
to see
 

367
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,590
to see
how bushy everything is but structural

368
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
how bushy everything is but structural
 

369
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,940
how bushy everything is but structural
integrity and I'm just going to push on

370
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:07,950
integrity and I'm just going to push on
 

371
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,240
integrity and I'm just going to push on
the earth and you can see that there is

372
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,250
the earth and you can see that there is
 

373
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:17,510
the earth and you can see that there is
now getting to him relative to it which

374
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:17,520
now getting to him relative to it which
 

375
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:28,970
now getting to him relative to it which
heart so if I cannot organize the end

376
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:28,980
heart so if I cannot organize the end
 

377
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,210
heart so if I cannot organize the end
and young here and I cannot organize the

378
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,220
and young here and I cannot organize the
 

379
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,780
and young here and I cannot organize the
young to get here now I have to change

380
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,790
young to get here now I have to change
 

381
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,780
young to get here now I have to change
the technique so I start in doing this

382
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:38,790
the technique so I start in doing this
 

383
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,570
the technique so I start in doing this
kind of stuff you see so instead of you

384
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:41,580
kind of stuff you see so instead of you
 

385
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,020
kind of stuff you see so instead of you
instead of using the ground I use this

386
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,030
instead of using the ground I use this
 

387
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,290
instead of using the ground I use this
kind of pushing my hips to see that I'm

388
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,300
kind of pushing my hips to see that I'm
 

389
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,830
kind of pushing my hips to see that I'm
just kind of pushing it as opposed to as

390
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:51,840
just kind of pushing it as opposed to as
 

391
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,830
just kind of pushing it as opposed to as
more I actually am releasing I released

392
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:54,840
more I actually am releasing I released
 

393
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,260
more I actually am releasing I released
him more so he hits the ground more I'm

394
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,270
him more so he hits the ground more I'm
 

395
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,750
him more so he hits the ground more I'm
actually releasing more as opposed to

396
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
actually releasing more as opposed to
 

397
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,720
actually releasing more as opposed to
this pushing and so because I lack the

398
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:04,730
this pushing and so because I lack the
 

399
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,640
this pushing and so because I lack the
physiological skill now I had to change

400
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:07,650
physiological skill now I had to change
 

401
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,880
physiological skill now I had to change
the technique you see that but that but

402
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:10,890
the technique you see that but that but
 

403
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,130
the technique you see that but that but
you can use the annyeong theory go

404
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,140
you can use the annyeong theory go
 

405
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,470
you can use the annyeong theory go
that's just pushing on what's pushing on

406
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
that's just pushing on what's pushing on
 

407
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,830
that's just pushing on what's pushing on
you do you understand and that's so I

408
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:18,840
you do you understand and that's so I
 

409
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,520
you do you understand and that's so I
know that's wrong okay but that's how it

410
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,530
know that's wrong okay but that's how it
 

411
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,500
know that's wrong okay but that's how it
happens okay all right so let's take

412
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:26,510
happens okay all right so let's take
 

413
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,530
happens okay all right so let's take
those mechanics and now let's look

414
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:30,540
those mechanics and now let's look
 

415
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,190
those mechanics and now let's look
relative to between him and I and

416
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,200
relative to between him and I and
 

417
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
relative to between him and I and
relative to the technique to prescribe

418
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:36,930
relative to the technique to prescribe
 

419
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,070
relative to the technique to prescribe
movement okay so I'm going to take the

420
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,080
movement okay so I'm going to take the
 

421
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,600
movement okay so I'm going to take the
same external firmness internal yielding

422
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:44,610
same external firmness internal yielding
 

423
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,690
same external firmness internal yielding
and I am going to keep it

424
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:48,700
and I am going to keep it
 

425
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,510
and I am going to keep it
and zero that's what I want to do that's

426
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:51,520
and zero that's what I want to do that's
 

427
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,760
and zero that's what I want to do that's
what the technique does so here we have

428
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:53,770
what the technique does so here we have
 

429
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,310
what the technique does so here we have
a contention you see that that's what I

430
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
a contention you see that that's what I
 

431
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,280
a contention you see that that's what I
was using to be able to project him

432
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,290
was using to be able to project him
 

433
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,850
was using to be able to project him
so if you if he went yeah right when I

434
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:02,860
so if you if he went yeah right when I
 

435
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,550
so if you if he went yeah right when I
yield when I yield he goes in go again

436
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:05,560
yield when I yield he goes in go again
 

437
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,620
yield when I yield he goes in go again
that's y'all try it again

438
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:07,630
that's y'all try it again
 

439
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,810
that's y'all try it again
he goes yes do you see and there's no

440
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:09,820
he goes yes do you see and there's no
 

441
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,860
he goes yes do you see and there's no
projection but if you push this hard oh

442
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:12,870
projection but if you push this hard oh
 

443
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,600
projection but if you push this hard oh
there's a projection so we're going to

444
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:15,610
there's a projection so we're going to
 

445
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,540
there's a projection so we're going to
show it again when I when I healed you

446
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,550
show it again when I when I healed you
 

447
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,430
show it again when I when I healed you
yield these thing done nothing okay so I

448
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
yield these thing done nothing okay so I
 

449
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,250
yield these thing done nothing okay so I
don't want to violate that by going

450
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,260
don't want to violate that by going
 

451
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,470
don't want to violate that by going
positive or negative because he could

452
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:31,480
positive or negative because he could
 

453
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,020
positive or negative because he could
yield if I go like this

454
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,030
yield if I go like this
 

455
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,470
yield if I go like this
so instead I keep this feeling this

456
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,480
so instead I keep this feeling this
 

457
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,620
so instead I keep this feeling this
pressure right here and I move off now

458
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:43,630
pressure right here and I move off now
 

459
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,230
pressure right here and I move off now
this will look to you like there was

460
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
this will look to you like there was
 

461
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,860
this will look to you like there was
he'll be on the horn like I'm going like

462
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:49,870
he'll be on the horn like I'm going like
 

463
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,400
he'll be on the horn like I'm going like
this you see

464
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,410

 

465
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,449

but I'm not I just I'll show you so when

466
00:13:59,449 --> 00:13:59,459
but I'm not I just I'll show you so when
 

467
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,599
but I'm not I just I'll show you so when
I go here can you push in I go here can

468
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:05,609
I go here can you push in I go here can
 

469
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,499
I go here can you push in I go here can
you push it

470
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:06,509
you push it
 

471
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:11,719
you push it
I go around can you push it push harder

472
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:11,729
I go around can you push it push harder
 

473
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:20,710
I go around can you push it push harder
No so you can see okay

474
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
No so you can see okay
 

475
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,960
No so you can see okay
and you you're gonna push me here okay

476
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:23,970
and you you're gonna push me here okay
 

477
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,269
and you you're gonna push me here okay
so I'm gonna yield you're gonna push me

478
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279
so I'm gonna yield you're gonna push me
 

479
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,749
so I'm gonna yield you're gonna push me
up we're on the other side you're gonna

480
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:32,759
up we're on the other side you're gonna
 

481
00:14:32,759 --> 00:15:05,900
up we're on the other side you're gonna
push me that's not

482
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:05,910

 

483
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,150

this is what a lot of people understand

484
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,160

that's making the wrists young go round

530
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:54,640
that's making the wrists young go round
 

531
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,750
that's making the wrists young go round
the wrist also heavy so it feels young

532
00:16:59,750 --> 00:16:59,760
the wrist also heavy so it feels young
 

533
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:16,740
the wrist also heavy so it feels young
boom oh yeah young give young okay so

534
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:16,750
boom oh yeah young give young okay so
 

535
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,860
boom oh yeah young give young okay so
let's do a little bit more sophisticated

536
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:18,870
let's do a little bit more sophisticated
 

537
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,900
let's do a little bit more sophisticated
philosophy how do I actually make the

538
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:21,910
philosophy how do I actually make the
 

539
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:29,340
philosophy how do I actually make the
elbow Johan yes yeah okay so I hope to

540
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,350
elbow Johan yes yeah okay so I hope to
 

541
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,620
elbow Johan yes yeah okay so I hope to
manifest as young as I brought young

542
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:31,630
manifest as young as I brought young
 

543
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,130
manifest as young as I brought young
energy to it yeah we're going to do I

544
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,140
energy to it yeah we're going to do I
 

545
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,600
energy to it yeah we're going to do I
make his elbow young I'm gonna make it

546
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,610
make his elbow young I'm gonna make it
 

547
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,070
make his elbow young I'm gonna make it
good yet again okay but I just want you

548
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,080
good yet again okay but I just want you
 

549
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,590
good yet again okay but I just want you
to i have structure and he's moving

550
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:46,600
to i have structure and he's moving
 

551
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,080
to i have structure and he's moving
around this is not yet and then you're

552
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,090
around this is not yet and then you're
 

553
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,310
around this is not yet and then you're
gonna feel the elbow copy mistake too

554
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,320
gonna feel the elbow copy mistake too
 

555
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,380
gonna feel the elbow copy mistake too
soft guilty

556
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,390

 

557
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:03,050

common mistake keeping water go round

558
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,060
common mistake keeping water go round
 

559
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,110
common mistake keeping water go round
hole then the way it's going to be there

560
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,120
hole then the way it's going to be there
 

561
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,350
hole then the way it's going to be there
okay

562
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360

 

563
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,080

so there's certain geometries that you

564
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,090
so there's certain geometries that you
 

565
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,900
so there's certain geometries that you
have to have okay so watch watch this

566
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:15,910
have to have okay so watch watch this
 

567
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,810
have to have okay so watch watch this
young

568
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:17,820
young
 

569
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,360
young
and generally there is an inward turning

570
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,370
and generally there is an inward turning
 

571
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,790
and generally there is an inward turning
spiral and then there is the opposite is

572
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:22,800
spiral and then there is the opposite is
 

573
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,180
spiral and then there is the opposite is
the outward turning spider okay so as I

574
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,190
the outward turning spider okay so as I
 

575
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:38,680
the outward turning spider okay so as I
go so I'm pointing outward oh this way

576
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,690
go so I'm pointing outward oh this way
 

577
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:47,630
go so I'm pointing outward oh this way
not like this that's young then there is

578
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:47,640
not like this that's young then there is
 

579
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,900
not like this that's young then there is
the larger circle which is I'm moving

580
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:50,910
the larger circle which is I'm moving
 

581
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,380
the larger circle which is I'm moving
this that way you see that so some of

582
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,390
this that way you see that so some of
 

583
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,940
this that way you see that so some of
your going along too young some of you

584
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:58,950
your going along too young some of you
 

585
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,300
your going along too young some of you
are only doing the larger circle but

586
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,310
are only doing the larger circle but
 

587
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,860
are only doing the larger circle but
you're going to get young right about

588
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:03,870
you're going to get young right about
 

589
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,580
you're going to get young right about
there okay so if you curve around it you

590
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,590
there okay so if you curve around it you
 

591
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,990
there okay so if you curve around it you
won't get it now here's the thing

592
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,000
won't get it now here's the thing
 

593
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,790
won't get it now here's the thing
you're gonna try that and you won't get

594
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:13,800
you're gonna try that and you won't get
 

595
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,220
you're gonna try that and you won't get
it why what was that because you have to

596
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,230
it why what was that because you have to
 

597
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,710
it why what was that because you have to
do the two in relation okay but why

598
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:21,720
do the two in relation okay but why
 

599
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,930
do the two in relation okay but why
can't I do with the two in relation to

600
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:23,940
can't I do with the two in relation to
 

601
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,760
can't I do with the two in relation to
each other you're right where what's the

602
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:28,770
each other you're right where what's the
 

603
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,800
each other you're right where what's the
interest concentric circle my mind is

604
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:33,810
interest concentric circle my mind is
 

605
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,800
interest concentric circle my mind is
going to chat me up okay because I can't

606
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:36,810
going to chat me up okay because I can't
 

607
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,920
going to chat me up okay because I can't
be a cat yield to him he pushes on me

608
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:39,930
be a cat yield to him he pushes on me
 

609
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,230
be a cat yield to him he pushes on me
and I will push back do you understand

610
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
and I will push back do you understand
 

611
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,390
and I will push back do you understand
and so these patterns will not make

612
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
and so these patterns will not make
 

613
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,680
and so these patterns will not make
sense to you will not trust them this

614
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:48,690
sense to you will not trust them this
 

615
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,230
sense to you will not trust them this
this will feel totally crazy to you

616
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,240
this will feel totally crazy to you
 

617
00:19:51,240 --> 00:20:00,980
this will feel totally crazy to you
unless you do this okay but it is soft

618
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:00,990
unless you do this okay but it is soft
 

619
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:24,270
unless you do this okay but it is soft
but firm this bulb

620
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,280

 

621
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:40,600

going back it could be nothing that

622
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:40,610
going back it could be nothing that
 

623
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,960
going back it could be nothing that
young says remember I told you it does

624
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:43,970
young says remember I told you it does
 

625
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,080
young says remember I told you it does
not mean oh it's always going back it

626
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,090
not mean oh it's always going back it
 

627
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,539
not mean oh it's always going back it
goes over okay

628
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:49,549
goes over okay
 

629
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,470
goes over okay
okay so remember we said that I helped

630
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:53,480
okay so remember we said that I helped
 

631
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,970
okay so remember we said that I helped
make that young by being in ok and then

632
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:57,980
make that young by being in ok and then
 

633
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,090
make that young by being in ok and then
by giving is young so how much you get

634
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,100
by giving is young so how much you get
 

635
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,950
by giving is young so how much you get
of one is how much you give of the other

636
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
of one is how much you give of the other
 

637
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,169
of one is how much you give of the other
your exam that means their relative we

638
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:08,179
your exam that means their relative we
 

639
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,990
your exam that means their relative we
said that and they're interdependent so

640
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,000
said that and they're interdependent so
 

641
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,560
said that and they're interdependent so
when I make how much young you get there

642
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,570
when I make how much young you get there
 

643
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,159
when I make how much young you get there
