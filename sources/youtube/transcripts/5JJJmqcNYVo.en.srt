00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,670

so to better understand figure eight

28
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
so to better understand figure eight
 

29
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,029
so to better understand figure eight
movements i'm going to show you a carly

stick first and then move

32
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
stick first and then move
 

33
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,150
stick first and then move
on to the staff later on from the front

34
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
on to the staff later on from the front
 

35
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,990
on to the staff later on from the front
profile if i take the stick from

36
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
profile if i take the stick from
 

37
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,630
profile if i take the stick from
side to side you can see it creates this

38
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
side to side you can see it creates this
 

39
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,270
side to side you can see it creates this
shape

40
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
shape
 

41
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,430
shape
where it's a circle on one side and then

42
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
where it's a circle on one side and then
 

43
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,430
where it's a circle on one side and then
a circle on the other side

44
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
a circle on the other side
 

45
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,830
a circle on the other side
when i'm doing these circles it creates

46
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
when i'm doing these circles it creates
 

47
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,750
when i'm doing these circles it creates
a figure eight pattern on its side

48
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
a figure eight pattern on its side
 

49
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,430
a figure eight pattern on its side
which is actually more like an infinity

50
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
which is actually more like an infinity
 

51
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,069
which is actually more like an infinity
sign

52
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079

 

53
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,310

that's both the same for forwards or

54
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
that's both the same for forwards or
 

55
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,510
that's both the same for forwards or
backwards

56
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520

 

57
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,029

from the side profile you can't really

58
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
from the side profile you can't really
 

59
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,389
from the side profile you can't really
see the figure eight as it just creates

60
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
see the figure eight as it just creates
 

61
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,389
see the figure eight as it just creates
circular movements both on the inside

62
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
circular movements both on the inside
 

63
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,189
circular movements both on the inside
and the outside so i'm going to start

64
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
and the outside so i'm going to start
 

65
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,390
and the outside so i'm going to start
side on with my arm

66
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
side on with my arm
 

67
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,750
side on with my arm
extended i rotate from my wrist

68
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
extended i rotate from my wrist
 

69
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,830
extended i rotate from my wrist
and if you notice my wrist is pointing

70
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
and if you notice my wrist is pointing
 

71
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,310
and if you notice my wrist is pointing
palm down to start with

72
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
palm down to start with
 

73
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,149
palm down to start with
from that position i rotate on the

74
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
from that position i rotate on the
 

75
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,550
from that position i rotate on the
inside so that's in front of me

76
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
inside so that's in front of me
 

77
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,190
inside so that's in front of me
from palm down to palm up

78
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
from palm down to palm up
 

79
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,510
from palm down to palm up
from this position i then rotate on the

80
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
from this position i then rotate on the
 

81
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,510
from this position i then rotate on the
outside behind me

82
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
outside behind me
 

83
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,230
outside behind me
so that's going to be from palm up back

84
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
so that's going to be from palm up back
 

85
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,670
so that's going to be from palm up back
to palm down and we're back to the

86
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
to palm down and we're back to the
 

87
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,350
to palm down and we're back to the
beginning again

88
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
beginning again
 

89
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,230
beginning again
if i repeat the process

90
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240

 

91
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,830

there so i'm arm up going

92
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
there so i'm arm up going
 

93
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,149
there so i'm arm up going
palm down to palm up to palm down

94
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
palm down to palm up to palm down
 

95
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,990
palm down to palm up to palm down
and then you just keep going until it

96
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
and then you just keep going until it
 

97
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,910
and then you just keep going until it
becomes that fluid motion

98
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
becomes that fluid motion
 

99
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,510
becomes that fluid motion
with a stick sometimes it's hard to know

100
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
with a stick sometimes it's hard to know
 

101
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,030
with a stick sometimes it's hard to know
which orientation you should have with

102
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
which orientation you should have with
 

103
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,749
which orientation you should have with
your wrist

104
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
your wrist
 

105
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,190
your wrist
and where you should have the way should

106
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
and where you should have the way should
 

107
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,030
and where you should have the way should
turn it to

108
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
turn it to
 

109
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
turn it to
if you do the same with the blade it's

110
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
if you do the same with the blade it's
 

111
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,030
if you do the same with the blade it's
sometimes easier to understand

112
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
sometimes easier to understand
 

113
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,950
sometimes easier to understand
if in this position we're starting blade

114
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
if in this position we're starting blade
 

115
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,749
if in this position we're starting blade
down then you rotate the blade

116
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
down then you rotate the blade
 

117
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,149
down then you rotate the blade
and now it's going to be blade side up

118
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
and now it's going to be blade side up
 

119
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,150
and now it's going to be blade side up
i'm going to turn it again now it's

120
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
i'm going to turn it again now it's
 

121
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,150
i'm going to turn it again now it's
going to be blade down

122
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
going to be blade down
 

123
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,350
going to be blade down
blade up lay down

124
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360

 

125
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,670

that'll be played up and that'll be laid

126
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
that'll be played up and that'll be laid
 

127
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,510
that'll be played up and that'll be laid
down

128
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
down
 

129
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,030
down
if you can visualize it like that it

130
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
if you can visualize it like that it
 

131
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,030
if you can visualize it like that it
helps a lot okay so how does this all

132
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
helps a lot okay so how does this all
 

133
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,949
helps a lot okay so how does this all
help learning to spin with the staff

134
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
help learning to spin with the staff
 

135
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,390
help learning to spin with the staff
with the joy you essentially do the same

136
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
with the joy you essentially do the same
 

137
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,550
with the joy you essentially do the same
movement you just focus on this end and

138
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
movement you just focus on this end and
 

139
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,470
movement you just focus on this end and
imagine that it's a carly staff

140
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
imagine that it's a carly staff
 

141
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,350

example
and you just do the same movement where

146
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
and you just do the same movement where
 

147
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,869
and you just do the same movement where
you're starting from palm down

00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
you're starting from palm down
 

149
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,670
you're starting from palm down
rotate it to palm up and then from palm

150
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
rotate it to palm up and then from palm

want to make sure that it's on the
outside or behind me then when i rotate

170
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
outside or behind me then when i rotate
 

171
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,390
outside or behind me then when i rotate
it in front of me

172
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
it in front of me
 

173
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,869
it in front of me
see it's going behind me then i rotate

174
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
see it's going behind me then i rotate
 

175
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,070
see it's going behind me then i rotate
to palm up

176
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
to palm up
 

177
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,949
to palm up
now it's in front of me from this side i

178
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
now it's in front of me from this side i
 

179
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,589
now it's in front of me from this side i
let it

180
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
let it
 

181
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,149
let it
let it go forward as i take this behind

182
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
let it go forward as i take this behind
 

183
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,309
let it go forward as i take this behind
me it then goes back to palm down and

184
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
me it then goes back to palm down and
 

185
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,430
me it then goes back to palm down and
now it's behind me

186
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
now it's behind me
 

187
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,149
now it's behind me
so when my palm is down it's behind when

188
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
so when my palm is down it's behind when
 

189
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,190
so when my palm is down it's behind when
my palm is up

190
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
my palm is up
 

191
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,830
my palm is up
it's in front so when you're looking at

192
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
it's in front so when you're looking at
 

193
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,190
it's in front so when you're looking at
this front on you want to make sure that

194
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
this front on you want to make sure that
 

195
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,390
this front on you want to make sure that
you're shifting enough

196
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
you're shifting enough
 

197
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,149
you're shifting enough
so you're leaving enough space either

198
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
so you're leaving enough space either
 

199
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,830
so you're leaving enough space either
side so you're not hitting yourself

200
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
side so you're not hitting yourself
 

201
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,190
side so you're not hitting yourself
when this comes up or behind you

202
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
when this comes up or behind you
 

203
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,350
when this comes up or behind you
when that comes there as well you want

204
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
when that comes there as well you want
 

205
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,309
when that comes there as well you want
to make sure that you've got enough

206
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
to make sure that you've got enough
 

207
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,430
to make sure that you've got enough
space either side

208
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
space either side
 

209
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,110
space either side
you could either do this by moving your

210
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
you could either do this by moving your
 

211
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,630
you could either do this by moving your
arm fully across

212
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
arm fully across
 

213
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,030
arm fully across
like this but what i prefer to do is

214
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
like this but what i prefer to do is
 

215
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,990
like this but what i prefer to do is
actually

216
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
actually
 

217
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,550
actually
turn in my body and make it more body

218
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
turn in my body and make it more body
 

219
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,270
turn in my body and make it more body
movement

220
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
movement
 

221
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,070
movement
rather than just my arms that applies

222
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
rather than just my arms that applies
 

223
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,149
rather than just my arms that applies
both for forwards

224
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
both for forwards
 

225
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,309
both for forwards
and then for backwards as well

226
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319

 

227
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,350

that's just something i've shown you on

228
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
that's just something i've shown you on
 

229
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,869
that's just something i've shown you on
the right side but you can also practice

230
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
the right side but you can also practice
 

231
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,750
the right side but you can also practice
on your left

232
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
on your left
 

233
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,990
on your left
going forwards and backwards

234
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000

 

235
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,350

once you've got this moving you can also

236
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
once you've got this moving you can also
 

237
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,190
once you've got this moving you can also
practice it down by your hips

238
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
practice it down by your hips
 

239
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,390
practice it down by your hips
and above your head and even

240
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
and above your head and even
 

241
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,830
and above your head and even
across your body and then just try to

242
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
across your body and then just try to
 

243
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,550
across your body and then just try to
link all the movements together

244
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,990
