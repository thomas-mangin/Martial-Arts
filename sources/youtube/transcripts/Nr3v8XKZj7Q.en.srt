you caught it coming down because the
 

95
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,170
you caught it coming down because the
hand

96
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,180
hand
 

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,749
hand
I can't touch this

98
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
I can't touch this
 

99
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,409
I can't touch this
you see I can't touch his wrist okay

100
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:51,419
you see I can't touch his wrist okay
 

101
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,070
you see I can't touch his wrist okay
so I'd like for you to use

102
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080
so I'd like for you to use
 

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,830
so I'd like for you to use
concept of key machine

104
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
concept of key machine
 

105
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,810
concept of key machine
the

106
00:04:59,810 --> 00:04:59,820
the
 

107
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,570
the
physiological index point I can't touch

108
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,580
physiological index point I can't touch
 

109
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,010
physiological index point I can't touch
his wrist

110
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,020
his wrist
 

111
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,210
his wrist
and therefore my hands go here

112
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,220
and therefore my hands go here
 

113
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,830
and therefore my hands go here
right here

114
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
right here
 

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,090
right here
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon

116
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,100
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon
 

117
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,469
so the tegatana is on the tricep tendon
of insertion

118
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
of insertion
 

119
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,490
of insertion
on the other hand is just North of it

120
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500
on the other hand is just North of it
 

121
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,249
on the other hand is just North of it
towards the shoulder okay

122
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:22,259
towards the shoulder okay
 

123
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,150
towards the shoulder okay
then his energy is going to come down

124
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
then his energy is going to come down
 

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,070
then his energy is going to come down
now

126
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
now
 

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,350
now
when his energy comes down where do you

128
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,360
when his energy comes down where do you
 

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,310
when his energy comes down where do you
think that goes anyone can answer

130
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
think that goes anyone can answer
 

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,409
think that goes anyone can answer
where am I going to take it

132
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,419
where am I going to take it
 

133
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,010
where am I going to take it
into a rotation nope that's your problem

134
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,020
into a rotation nope that's your problem
 

135
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,870
into a rotation nope that's your problem
I'm not going to take it into a rotation

136
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm not going to take it into a rotation
 

137
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,830
I'm not going to take it into a rotation
okay the first thing I do he goes cool

138
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
okay the first thing I do he goes cool
 

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,730
okay the first thing I do he goes cool
and I'm going to project do you see and

140

and I'm going to project do you see and
I'll project him look look at where we

142
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll project him look look at where we
 

143
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,890
I'll project him look look at where we
are now do you see if the camera comes

144
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
are now do you see if the camera comes
 

145
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,270
are now do you see if the camera comes
over there

146
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
over there
 

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,930
over there
where do you go

148
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:58,940
where do you go
 

149
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,629
where do you go
he's off the line and now I can enter

150
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
he's off the line and now I can enter
 

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,390
he's off the line and now I can enter
here it's ever so it's not an external

152
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,400
here it's ever so it's not an external
 

153
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,370
here it's ever so it's not an external
thing it becomes an extra little thing

154
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,380
thing it becomes an extra little thing
 

155
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,070
thing it becomes an extra little thing
after the projection okay

156
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
after the projection okay
 

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,409
after the projection okay
so I'm going to come around and bring

158
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
so I'm going to come around and bring
 

159
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,390
so I'm going to come around and bring
the camera back around over to this side

160
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
the camera back around over to this side
 

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,570
the camera back around over to this side
it is his hands coming down I started to

162
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:17,580
it is his hands coming down I started to
 

163
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,129
it is his hands coming down I started to
rotate

164
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
rotate
 

165
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,490
rotate
this half will come

166
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:22,500
this half will come
 

167
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,790
this half will come
from the ticketana around

168
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:25,800
from the ticketana around
 

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,670
from the ticketana around
just below the elbow because again I

170
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
just below the elbow because again I
 

171
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,850
just below the elbow because again I
can't reach that okay just below the

172
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:31,860
