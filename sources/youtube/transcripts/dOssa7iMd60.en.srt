00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,910

don't start way out there

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920

 

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,890

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:10,830

so

10
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

 

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:24,830

oh

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:39,910

so

14
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920

 

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,990

okay first thing don't start a million

16
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
okay first thing don't start a million
 

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,590
okay first thing don't start a million
miles away

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
miles away
 

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,270
miles away
let's go back he's gonna

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
let's go back he's gonna
 

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,030
let's go back he's gonna
come in showman okay

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
come in showman okay
 

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,030
come in showman okay
so he's gonna go

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
so he's gonna go
 

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,670
so he's gonna go
this is not striking the range

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680

 

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630

you're in close perfect when someone

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
you're in close perfect when someone
 

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,830
you're in close perfect when someone
would decide to hit you

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
would decide to hit you
 

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,190
would decide to hit you
wow okay

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
wow okay
 

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,790
wow okay
so second thing strike goes up that's

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so second thing strike goes up that's
 

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,710
so second thing strike goes up that's
the yin opening

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720

 

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,670

up down not the technique

38
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680

 

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,350

so up i find it but you'll feel the

40
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
so up i find it but you'll feel the
 

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,190
so up i find it but you'll feel the
pressure because he's supposed to strike

42
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
pressure because he's supposed to strike
 

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,589
pressure because he's supposed to strike
down

44
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599

 

45
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,949

he does not wait at the top for me

46
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
he does not wait at the top for me
 

47
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,150
he does not wait at the top for me
to do my technique

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
to do my technique
 

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,430
to do my technique
his strike goes up and down

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440

 

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,430

so when i feel the pressure change

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
so when i feel the pressure change
 

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,949
so when i feel the pressure change
that's when i'm getting caught out of

54
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
that's when i'm getting caught out of
 

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,990
that's when i'm getting caught out of
the way

56
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000

 

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,270

that far away ah i'll feel i'll feel the

58
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
that far away ah i'll feel i'll feel the
 

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,430
that far away ah i'll feel i'll feel the
weight and i yield to it

60
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440

 

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,470

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
underneath the elbow
 

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,710
underneath the elbow
up down

64
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720

 

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,990

oh i'm not shoving it down

66
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
oh i'm not shoving it down
 

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,670
oh i'm not shoving it down
i'm blending with this down

68
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680

 

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,949

hold down

70
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959

 

71
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,390

up down

72
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400

 

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,030

third hand positioning just like

you can't reach the hat the only way you

80

is if you caught it coming down that's a

is if you caught it coming down that's a
 

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,470
is if you caught it coming down that's a
young young clash

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
young young clash
 

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,589
young young clash
or he was never going to come up

88
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
or he was never going to come up
 

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,750
or he was never going to come up
to come down in the first way he's just

90
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
to come down in the first way he's just
 

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,589
to come down in the first way he's just
sticking his hand out there

92
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
sticking his hand out there
 

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,190
sticking his hand out there
in some masturbatory semblance of the

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
in some masturbatory semblance of the

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,030
in some masturbatory semblance of the

96
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
strike
 

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,309
strike
so instead here

98
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
so instead here
 

99
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,830
so instead here
baby i feel pressure yield to the

100
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
baby i feel pressure yield to the
 

101
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,990
baby i feel pressure yield to the
pressure

102
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000

 

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,229

off yield to the pressure

104
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239

 

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,830

so he goes up down to the pressure

106
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:26,629

oh

108
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639

 

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,430

all right so usually you're okay waiting

110
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
all right so usually you're okay waiting
 

111
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,870
all right so usually you're okay waiting
there for you

112
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
there for you
 

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,870
there for you
and then you come around and you make

114
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
and then you come around and you make
 

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,390
and then you come around and you make
them come over here

116
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
them come over here
 

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,110
them come over here
wait that's not the strike

118
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
wait that's not the strike
 

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,590
wait that's not the strike
so he's going up and then his strike

120
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
so he's going up and then his strike
 

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,950
so he's going up and then his strike
just goes down

122
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960

 

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,670

you cannot make that strike it's going

124
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
you cannot make that strike it's going
 

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,430
you cannot make that strike it's going
down he's going down

126
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
down he's going down
 

127
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,110
down he's going down
come all the way over here without

128
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
come all the way over here without
 

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,950
come all the way over here without
pulling him in a young young clash

130
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
pulling him in a young young clash
 

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,830
pulling him in a young young clash
so it's up in our blend with the

132
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
so it's up in our blend with the
 

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,350
so it's up in our blend with the
strength

134
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
strength
 

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,710
strength
and that is generally all you can get

136
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
and that is generally all you can get
 

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,110
and that is generally all you can get
at full speed and probably less than

you start looking for more than that and
