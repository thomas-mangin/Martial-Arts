this one
is an easy one

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
is an easy one
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,430

here see there's a shape there that's

18
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
here see there's a shape there that's
 

19
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,550
here see there's a shape there that's
got the same thing i like teaching in

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
got the same thing i like teaching in
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,150
got the same thing i like teaching in
this place see

22
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
this place see
 

23
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,630
this place see
we start putting our body in the same

24
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
we start putting our body in the same
 

25
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,470
we start putting our body in the same
positions

26
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
positions
 

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,790
positions
and we start piling up what we can do

28
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
and we start piling up what we can do
 

29
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,990
and we start piling up what we can do
the same

30
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
the same
 

31
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,549
the same
so we get here when we get here and then

32
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
so we get here when we get here and then
 

33
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,790
so we get here when we get here and then
we bring it here

34
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
we bring it here
 

35
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,310
we bring it here
so now i'm at this angle and he's at

36
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
so now i'm at this angle and he's at
 

37
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,590
so now i'm at this angle and he's at
that angle

38
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
that angle
 

39
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,670
that angle
what is the contradiction of what i've

40
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
what is the contradiction of what i've
 

41
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,430
what is the contradiction of what i've
been saying

42
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
