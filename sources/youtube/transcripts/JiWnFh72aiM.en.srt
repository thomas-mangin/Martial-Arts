1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,430

okay so again the same thing that I

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,440
okay so again the same thing that I
 

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,430
okay so again the same thing that I
always say there's not two Arts okay so

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
always say there's not two Arts okay so
 

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,350
always say there's not two Arts okay so
as we come in already I'm reconciling my

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
as we come in already I'm reconciling my
 

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,669
as we come in already I'm reconciling my
materiality my energy that is working

8
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:12,679
materiality my energy that is working
 

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,509
materiality my energy that is working
through me going through my body onto

10
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:14,519
through me going through my body onto
 

11
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,950
through me going through my body onto
the ground vectors as we come in then I

12
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:17,960
the ground vectors as we come in then I
 

13
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,429
the ground vectors as we come in then I
yield so here's my angle

14
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
yield so here's my angle
 

15
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,589
yield so here's my angle
change my angle

16
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:23,599
change my angle
 

17
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,109
change my angle
change right but I'm not just trying to

18
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
change right but I'm not just trying to
 

19
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,950
change right but I'm not just trying to
get

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
get
 

21
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,110
get
out so as as I change my angle in other

22
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
out so as as I change my angle in other
 

23
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,069
out so as as I change my angle in other
words I don't leave his body there his

00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:35,079
words I don't leave his body there his
 

25
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,150
words I don't leave his body there his
body is moving with me you see with my

okay and that's going to require you
 

69
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,230
okay and that's going to require you
again in his body that's going to

70
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
again in his body that's going to
 

71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,150
again in his body that's going to
require you again to as you feel his

72

require you again to as you feel his
 

73
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:24,910
require you again to as you feel his
mass that energy too has to be

74
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:24,920

 

75
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,150

internalized okay let's go okay so

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
internalized okay let's go okay so
 

77
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,350
internalized okay let's go okay so
continuing on yesterday

as I go for my wrist locks here you
 

89
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,869
as I go for my wrist locks here you
you'll find them

90
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:51,879
you'll find them
 

91

uh you'll let's say let's say I go for
 

93
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,710
uh you'll let's say let's say I go for
the wrist lock and he pulls his arm out

94
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
the wrist lock and he pulls his arm out
 

95
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,470
the wrist lock and he pulls his arm out
now cuz he's he's trying to do uh

96
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
now cuz he's he's trying to do uh
 

97
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,589
now cuz he's he's trying to do uh
his stuff and it'll create openings do

98
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
his stuff and it'll create openings do
 

99
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,229
his stuff and it'll create openings do
you see that as he has to protect

100
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:05,239
you see that as he has to protect
 

101
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:07,350
you see that as he has to protect
himself okay you understand that so the

102
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
himself okay you understand that so the
 

103
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,350
himself okay you understand that so the
same thing like on

104
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
same thing like on
 

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,589
same thing like on
the on the

106
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
the on the
 

107
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,789
the on the
ground right and uh let's say uh I'm

108
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
ground right and uh let's say uh I'm
 

109
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,589
ground right and uh let's say uh I'm
doing this kind of stuff right and he's

110
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
doing this kind of stuff right and he's
 

111
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,110
doing this kind of stuff right and he's
got no choice but to try to create space

112
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,120
got no choice but to try to create space
 

113
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,589
got no choice but to try to create space
with the other arm cuz I'm pinning it

114
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:24,599
with the other arm cuz I'm pinning it
 

115
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,550
with the other arm cuz I'm pinning it
and he's got no space here so as he goes

116
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:27,560
and he's got no space here so as he goes
 

117
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,789
and he's got no space here so as he goes
to create space well that's where I'm

118
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:29,799
to create space well that's where I'm
 

119
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,990
to create space well that's where I'm
attacking the the wrist do you see and

120
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
attacking the the wrist do you see and
 

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,869
attacking the the wrist do you see and
so from that from that wrist attack I'm

122
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
so from that from that wrist attack I'm
 

123
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,630
so from that from that wrist attack I'm
I'm still attacking the wrist do you see

124
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm still attacking the wrist do you see
 

125
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,070
I'm still attacking the wrist do you see
as I'm going into the mount and is a

126
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
as I'm going into the mount and is a
 

127
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,470
as I'm going into the mount and is a
much easier Mount than I'm find a mount

128
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:43,480
much easier Mount than I'm find a mount
 

129
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,390
much easier Mount than I'm find a mount
and he has pure 100% defense you got

130
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,400
and he has pure 100% defense you got
 

131
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,710
and he has pure 100% defense you got
that okay so on this one we'll go slow

132
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:51,720
that okay so on this one we'll go slow
 

133
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,550
that okay so on this one we'll go slow
but it's the same

134
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:53,560
but it's the same
 

135
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,750
but it's the same
thing take the y

136
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
thing take the y
 

137
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,830
thing take the y
space use your shoulder to put

138
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
space use your shoulder to put
 

139
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,229
space use your shoulder to put
push and my hand

140
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
push and my hand
 

141
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,589
push and my hand
catches the action here instead of

142
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:06,599
catches the action here instead of
 

143
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,830
catches the action here instead of
stepping in to attack the leg I step in

144
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
stepping in to attack the leg I step in
 

145
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,750
stepping in to attack the leg I step in
to keep contact with the elbow and

146
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
to keep contact with the elbow and
 

147
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,229
to keep contact with the elbow and
that's where I find

148
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239

 

149
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,870

in so just like in
 

253
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,029
in so just like in
E I don't bypass the leg to get the

254
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:18,039

 

255
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,510

arm on juj Naga same thing I'm not just

256
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
arm on juj Naga same thing I'm not just
 

257
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,749
arm on juj Naga same thing I'm not just
accelerating in by the arm

258
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:26,759
accelerating in by the arm
 

259
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,550
accelerating in by the arm
me not here

260
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560

 

261
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,070

and this takes

262
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,080
and this takes
 

263
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,950
and this takes
the technique is I'm not attacking his

264
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:35,960
the technique is I'm not attacking his
 

265
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,869
the technique is I'm not attacking his
arm I would have to use my arms okay and

266
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:38,879
arm I would have to use my arms okay and
 

267
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,350
arm I would have to use my arms okay and
we're just using that principle here so

268
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360
we're just using that principle here so
 

269
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,550
we're just using that principle here so
as I come

270
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:43,560
as I come
 

271
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,790
as I come
around on the first technique right I

272
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:47,800
around on the first technique right I
 

273
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,029
around on the first technique right I
again there it is right there just say

274
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,039
again there it is right there just say
 

275
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,710
again there it is right there just say
there please there's that triangle and

276
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:53,720
there please there's that triangle and
 

277
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,550
there please there's that triangle and
that's why I insert my triangle and

278
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
that's why I insert my triangle and
 

279
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,029
that's why I insert my triangle and
let's turn this so the camera can see

280
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
let's turn this so the camera can see
 

281
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,149
let's turn this so the camera can see
okay

282
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:00,159
okay
 

283
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,510
okay
I don't have to I don't want to parallel

284
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
I don't have to I don't want to parallel
 

285
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,350
I don't have to I don't want to parallel
you I'm going to attack this

286
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,360

 

287
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,869

leg so if you pay attention to my arms

288
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
leg so if you pay attention to my arms
 

289
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,869
leg so if you pay attention to my arms
on the first technique they don't do

290
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:11,879
on the first technique they don't do
 

291
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:19,110
on the first technique they don't do
anything they just stay United to my

292
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120

 

293
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,589

body well the same thing is happening on

294
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
body well the same thing is happening on
 

295
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,390
body well the same thing is happening on
this technique get out of your arms as

296
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,400
this technique get out of your arms as
 

297
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,990
this technique get out of your arms as
you're going into the

298
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000

299
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,270
you're going into the
lock don't pull the arm down you're

300
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
lock don't pull the arm down you're
 

301
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,750
lock don't pull the arm down you're
going to take the lock

302
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:32,760
going to take the lock
 

303
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,149
going to take the lock
off keep the lock on and attack the

304
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:37,159
off keep the lock on and attack the
 

305
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,149
off keep the lock on and attack the
leg the only arm movement comes after

306
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
leg the only arm movement comes after
 

307
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,110
leg the only arm movement comes after
for that final cooku projection

308
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
for that final cooku projection
 

309
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,910
for that final cooku projection
okay so here

310
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

 

311
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,829

here slip in don't undo the lock keep

312
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
here slip in don't undo the lock keep
 

313
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,590
here slip in don't undo the lock keep
the lock and attack the

314
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:56,600
the lock and attack the
 

315
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,750
the lock and attack the
leg then the arm movement comes on that

316
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:00,760
leg then the arm movement comes on that
 

317
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,360
leg then the arm movement comes on that
okay let try it again
