1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,110

so if if you have a

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120

 

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,030

a spiritual mentor today

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
a spiritual mentor today
 

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,150
a spiritual mentor today
because everything has been modernized

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
because everything has been modernized
 

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,429
because everything has been modernized
they're usually a lecturer they talk

8
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
they're usually a lecturer they talk
 

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,150
they're usually a lecturer they talk
and you listen and you think

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
and you listen and you think
 

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,870
and you listen and you think
okay

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880

 

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,870

it is a modern corruption

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880

 

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,589

talking thinking

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
talking thinking
 

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,990
talking thinking
is not the way

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000

 

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,470

the mind that is sick cannot cure itself

20
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
the mind that is sick cannot cure itself
 

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,950
the mind that is sick cannot cure itself
it's a dead end

22
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
it's a dead end
 

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,430
it's a dead end
so what we're doing

24
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
so what we're doing
 

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,430
so what we're doing
is a pre-modern way

26
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
is a pre-modern way
 

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,750
is a pre-modern way
you come into the mind

28
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
you come into the mind
 

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,510
you come into the mind
through the body

30
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
through the body
 

31
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,790
through the body
through the body

32
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
through the body
 

33
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,430
through the body
okay because and this is possible

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
okay because and this is possible
 

35
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,470
okay because and this is possible
because of the body-mind unification

36
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
because of the body-mind unification
 

37
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,430
because of the body-mind unification
okay

38
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
okay
 

39
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,670
okay
but it's not quite the mind

40
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
but it's not quite the mind
 

41
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,910
but it's not quite the mind
it's just different enough

42
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
it's just different enough
 

43
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,350
it's just different enough
that

44
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
that
 

45
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,429
that
it doesn't get corrupted the way the

46
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
it doesn't get corrupted the way the
 

47
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,550
it doesn't get corrupted the way the
sick mind just makes more sick mind okay

48
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
sick mind just makes more sick mind okay
 

49
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,510
sick mind just makes more sick mind okay
so

50
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
so
 

51
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,990
so
in my movement

52
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
in my movement
 

53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,270
in my movement
i should be able to demonstrate

54
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
i should be able to demonstrate
 

55
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,190
i should be able to demonstrate
communion

56
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
communion
 

57
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,670
communion
and a reconciliation of dichotomy so

58
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
and a reconciliation of dichotomy so
 

59
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,749
and a reconciliation of dichotomy so
right now i there's a physical hymn and

60
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
right now i there's a physical hymn and
 

61
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,510
right now i there's a physical hymn and
a physical me

62
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
a physical me
 

63
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,149
a physical me
so maybe he goes you're here

64
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159

 

65
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,550

you're fighting him and you do the same

66
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
you're fighting him and you do the same
 

67
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,230
you're fighting him and you do the same
technique

68
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
technique
 

69
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,910
technique
shove him down

70
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
shove him down
 

71
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,990
shove him down
and get on

72
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000

 

73
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,270

and here it looks society

74
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
and here it looks society
 

75
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,710
and here it looks society
but there are things you need to look

76
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
but there are things you need to look
 

77
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,990
but there are things you need to look
for

78
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
for
 

79
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,310
for
the dichotomous mind cannot move at the

80
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
the dichotomous mind cannot move at the
 

81
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,230
the dichotomous mind cannot move at the
speed of life

82
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
speed of life
 

83
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,630
speed of life
so it shows up

84
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
so it shows up
 

85
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,469
so it shows up
in gaps

86
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
in gaps
 

87
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,149
in gaps
and in delays

88
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
and in delays
 

89
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,389
and in delays
and in staccato-like movement

90
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
and in staccato-like movement
 

91
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,429
and in staccato-like movement
that create the gaps okay because he's

92
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
that create the gaps okay because he's
 

93
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,550
that create the gaps okay because he's
not falling staccato-like you see he

94
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
not falling staccato-like you see he
 

95
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,229
not falling staccato-like you see he
just falls at once

96
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
just falls at once
 

97
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,790
just falls at once
so the other thing to note

98
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so the other thing to note
 

99
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,670
so the other thing to note
is that inside his movement there is

100
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
is that inside his movement there is
 

101
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,589
is that inside his movement there is
always a hidden space

102
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
always a hidden space
 

103
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,869
always a hidden space
and i always step into the in space

104
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
and i always step into the in space
 

105
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,949
and i always step into the in space
when i have a dichotomous relationship

106
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
when i have a dichotomous relationship
 

107
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,990
when i have a dichotomous relationship
with him i always try to overpower him

108
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
with him i always try to overpower him
 

109
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,150
with him i always try to overpower him
and i always move into the young space

110
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
and i always move into the young space
 

111
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,150
and i always move into the young space
through more young and it's incorrect

112
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
through more young and it's incorrect
 

113
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,190
through more young and it's incorrect
okay

114
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
okay
 

115
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,190
okay
so the same the same movement

116
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
so the same the same movement
 

117
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,470
so the same the same movement
instead of this one stopping him and

118
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
instead of this one stopping him and
 

119
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,350
instead of this one stopping him and
then get ready to make him go again

120
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
then get ready to make him go again
 

121
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,589
then get ready to make him go again
i just use the same movement he's going

122
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
i just use the same movement he's going
 

123
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,790
i just use the same movement he's going
do you see

124
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800

 

125
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,190

and this step here that we're using as a

126
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
and this step here that we're using as a
 

127
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,790
and this step here that we're using as a
kind of trip

128
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
kind of trip
 

129
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,589
kind of trip
i just step because there's yin there

130
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
i just step because there's yin there
 

131
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,270
i just step because there's yin there
and he'll go around

132
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
and he'll go around
 

133
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,350
and he'll go around
so he's coming in and he's going around

134
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
so he's coming in and he's going around
 

135
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,470
so he's coming in and he's going around
me

136
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
me
 

137
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,030
me
he's going around

138
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
he's going around
 

139
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,869
he's going around
same exact thing

140
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
same exact thing
 

141
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,350
same exact thing
he's going around

142
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
he's going around
 

143
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,710
he's going around
and i try to reduce this gap

144
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
and i try to reduce this gap
 

145
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,869
and i try to reduce this gap
so as we watch

146
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
so as we watch
 

147
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,270
so as we watch
the chest to chest space that's going

148
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
the chest to chest space that's going
 

149
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,070
the chest to chest space that's going
here

150
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
here
 

151
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,149
here
i try to get rid of it asap

152
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
i try to get rid of it asap
 

153
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,869
i try to get rid of it asap
then i try to get rid of the secret

154
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
then i try to get rid of the secret
 

155
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,869
then i try to get rid of the secret
there's the knot this the not this and

156
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
there's the knot this the not this and
 

157
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,990
there's the knot this the not this and
that and i just go to one thing

158
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
that and i just go to one thing
 

159
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:53,190
that and i just go to one thing
one

160
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200

 

161
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,110

and you can see it starts to become

162
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
and you can see it starts to become
 

163
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,949
and you can see it starts to become
spiral

164
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
spiral
 

165
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,630
spiral
it stops being

166
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
it stops being
 

167
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,630
it stops being
x y grid path

168
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
x y grid path
 

169
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,910
x y grid path
okay

170
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
okay
 

171
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:22,710
okay
let's try to get these

172
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720

 

173
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:34,470

so

174
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:34,480

 

175
00:04:34,480 --> 00:05:01,350

[Music]

176
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360

 

177
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
