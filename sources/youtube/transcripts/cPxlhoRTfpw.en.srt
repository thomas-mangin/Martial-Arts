1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,750

knee pull

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
knee pull
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,749
knee pull
so uh first you have to float it

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
so uh first you have to float it
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,509
so uh first you have to float it
so first elongate up

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
so first elongate up
 

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,030
so first elongate up
then try to stay as high as you can

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
then try to stay as high as you can
 

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,390
then try to stay as high as you can
and that's what comes forward

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400

 

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,390

so out my knees are going to go up my

12
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
so out my knees are going to go up my
 

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,070
so out my knees are going to go up my
pelvis is going to go up

14
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
pelvis is going to go up
 

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:33,190
pelvis is going to go up
and then they're going to come forward

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200

 

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:42,830

you're doing two moves one

18
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,950

two

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
two
 

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,630
two
okay let's go okay so

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
okay let's go okay so
 

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,389
okay let's go okay so
remember the aspects of it so it's the

24
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
remember the aspects of it so it's the
 

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,430
remember the aspects of it so it's the
my hips over his hips

26
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
my hips over his hips
 

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,790
my hips over his hips
that is the guard part keeping him back

28
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
that is the guard part keeping him back
 

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,950
that is the guard part keeping him back
he can't come forward

30
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960

 

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,070

then my knees

32
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
then my knees
 

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,270
then my knees
my inner knees you want to try to be on

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
my inner knees you want to try to be on
 

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,550
my inner knees you want to try to be on
the back hemisphere

36
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
the back hemisphere
 

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,350
the back hemisphere
the back hemisphere so there's a line on

38
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
the back hemisphere so there's a line on
 

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,550
the back hemisphere so there's a line on
his side

40
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
his side
 

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,070
his side
i don't want my knees on that line or

42
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
i don't want my knees on that line or
 

43
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,149
i don't want my knees on that line or
worse in front of the line even if my

44
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
worse in front of the line even if my
 

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,590
worse in front of the line even if my
legs are long enough

46
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
legs are long enough
 

47
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,109
legs are long enough
if your legs are long enough take

48
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
if your legs are long enough take
 

49
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,350
if your legs are long enough take
advantage of it

50
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
advantage of it
 

51
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,310
advantage of it
and then bring the third aspect the

52
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
and then bring the third aspect the
 

53
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,069
and then bring the third aspect the
bottom legs

54
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
bottom legs
 

55
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,830
bottom legs
are on him wait wait on him

56
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
are on him wait wait on him
 

57
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,990
are on him wait wait on him
so not out here okay

58
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
so not out here okay
 

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,429
so not out here okay
so up

60
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
so up
 

61
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,830
so up
in and then weight is here

62
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
in and then weight is here
 

63
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,550
in and then weight is here
so he's going to try to get up and i'm

64
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
so he's going to try to get up and i'm
 

65
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:58,069
so he's going to try to get up and i'm
just leaving that weight there

66
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079

 

67
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,149

it's not that he can't get up he can get

68
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
it's not that he can't get up he can get
 

69
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,429
it's not that he can't get up he can get
up but there's

70
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
up but there's
 

71
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,389
up but there's
pressure on the upper part of his spine

72
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
pressure on the upper part of his spine
 

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:17,030
pressure on the upper part of his spine
his legs are down not him

74
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040

 

75
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,190

okay

76
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200

 

77
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,869

so the first ground vector he has to

78
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
so the first ground vector he has to
 

79
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,510
so the first ground vector he has to
deal with

80
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
deal with
 

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,869
deal with
is this front part of my legs

82
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
is this front part of my legs
 

83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,830
is this front part of my legs
okay so uh he does not bring me up

84
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
okay so uh he does not bring me up

00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
and he just tries to bring me forward i
 

87
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,790
and he just tries to bring me forward i
can just ground that

88
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
can just ground that
 

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,470

okay goes up and so i'm here
 

95
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,550
okay goes up and so i'm here
he changed the relationship and now he

96
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
he changed the relationship and now he
 

97
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,790
he changed the relationship and now he
has to feel that problem

98
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
has to feel that problem
 

99
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,270
has to feel that problem
and he has to get me over that so he

100
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
and he has to get me over that so he
 

101
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,229
and he has to get me over that so he
goes

102
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
goes
 

103
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,589
goes
boom good okay and now

104
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
boom good okay and now
 

105
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,509
boom good okay and now
he has to be cognizant

106
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
he has to be cognizant
 

107
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,710
he has to be cognizant
that this is not too low because i can

108
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
that this is not too low because i can
 

109
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,110
that this is not too low because i can
move

110
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
move
 

111
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,110
move
up and i'm right back or i started okay

112
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
up and i'm right back or i started okay
 

113
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,430
up and i'm right back or i started okay
so he has to feel give me the final

114
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
so he has to feel give me the final
 

115
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,149
so he has to feel give me the final
position

116
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
position
 

117
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,350
position
okay he has to be wary that i'm not

118
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
okay he has to be wary that i'm not
 

119
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,949
okay he has to be wary that i'm not
coming inside of

120
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
coming inside of
 

121
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,149
coming inside of
this thing at the same time

122
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
this thing at the same time
 

123
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,110
this thing at the same time
i move under under this thing i'll get

124
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
i move under under this thing i'll get
 

125
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,869
i move under under this thing i'll get
right back where i want to be

126
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
right back where i want to be
 

127
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,509
right back where i want to be
okay so he's gonna float

128
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
okay so he's gonna float
 

129
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,149
okay so he's gonna float
then he you should feel my knees i go

130
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
then he you should feel my knees i go
 

131
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,869
then he you should feel my knees i go
over it

132
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
over it
 

133
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,070
over it
good and then he's gotta keep me down as

134
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
good and then he's gotta keep me down as
 

135
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,509
good and then he's gotta keep me down as
high as possible

136
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
high as possible
 

137
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,589
high as possible
so let's scoot this lower because if

138
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
so let's scoot this lower because if
 

139
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,630
so let's scoot this lower because if
it's low

140
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
it's low
 

141
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,990
it's low
it's easy just to reset okay

142
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
it's easy just to reset okay
 

143
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,990
it's easy just to reset okay
so again elongate over the knee

144
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
so again elongate over the knee
 

145
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,789
so again elongate over the knee
boom and then down so for me this is too

146
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
boom and then down so for me this is too
 

147
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,429
boom and then down so for me this is too
low

148
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
low
 

149
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,229
low
there you go you got to really try to

150
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
there you go you got to really try to
 

151
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,550
there you go you got to really try to
get to the top part of my spine

152
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
get to the top part of my spine
 

153
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,990
get to the top part of my spine
okay because as he goes

154
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
okay because as he goes
 

155
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,030
okay because as he goes
boom boom and he's low uh

156
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
boom boom and he's low uh
 

157
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,509
boom boom and he's low uh
it's it's easy for me to move inside of

158
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
it's it's easy for me to move inside of
 

159
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,750
it's it's easy for me to move inside of
the same thing that i was reversing

160
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
the same thing that i was reversing
 

161
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,509
the same thing that i was reversing
okay and it should not be so easy so

162
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
okay and it should not be so easy so
 

163
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,270
okay and it should not be so easy so
let's say

164
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280

 

165
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,310

difference in torsos leg length

166
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
difference in torsos leg length
 

167
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,790
difference in torsos leg length
all that kind of stuff okay i still

168
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
all that kind of stuff okay i still
 

169
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,070
all that kind of stuff okay i still
gonna float

170
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
gonna float
 

171
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,990
gonna float
then over the knees and if i have to

172
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
then over the knees and if i have to
 

173
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,189
then over the knees and if i have to
i'll climb again i gotta be as high as

174
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
i'll climb again i gotta be as high as
 

175
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,990
i'll climb again i gotta be as high as
possible

176
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
possible
 

177
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,710
possible
and not down here where it's comfortable

178
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
and not down here where it's comfortable
 

179
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,690
and not down here where it's comfortable
so feel how you can

180
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,700
so feel how you can
 

181
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,189
so feel how you can

it yes so when i come

184
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
it yes so when i come
 

185
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,830
it yes so when i come
up boom try to be here as high as

186
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
up boom try to be here as high as
 

187
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,710
up boom try to be here as high as
possible

188
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
possible
 

189
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,909
possible
so he goes it's hard for him

190
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
so he goes it's hard for him
 

191
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,510
so he goes it's hard for him
to s out of that okay

192
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
to s out of that okay
 

193
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
to s out of that okay
all right let's try all right so you

194
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
all right let's try all right so you
 

195
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,830
all right let's try all right so you
have to be sensitive to

196
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
have to be sensitive to
 

197
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,870
have to be sensitive to
uh be able to determine what are the

198
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
uh be able to determine what are the
 

199
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,629
uh be able to determine what are the
structures of his

200
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
structures of his
 

201
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,590
structures of his
equilibrium okay and then otherwise how

202
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
equilibrium okay and then otherwise how
 

203
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,749
equilibrium okay and then otherwise how
do i just deconstruct them

204
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
do i just deconstruct them
 

205
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,150
do i just deconstruct them
um usually what the beginner does is

206
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
um usually what the beginner does is
 

207
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,749
um usually what the beginner does is
they just deconstruct

208
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
they just deconstruct
 

209
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,310
they just deconstruct
by the application of the form which

210
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
by the application of the form which
 

211
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,950
by the application of the form which
kind of

212
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
kind of
 

213
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,909
kind of
technically pre-deconstructed what

214
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
technically pre-deconstructed what
 

215
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,189
technically pre-deconstructed what
they're doing but you'll find when you

216
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
they're doing but you'll find when you
 

217
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,870
they're doing but you'll find when you
go to giwaza

218
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
go to giwaza
 

219
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,550
go to giwaza
it doesn't really work that way the dude

220
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
it doesn't really work that way the dude
 

221
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,310
it doesn't really work that way the dude
moved a little bit things are a little

222
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
moved a little bit things are a little
 

223
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,150
moved a little bit things are a little
bit off so you always have to be able to

224
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
bit off so you always have to be able to
 

225
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,430
bit off so you always have to be able to
adapt the form

226
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
adapt the form
 

227
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,110
adapt the form
in order to adapt the form you have to

228
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
in order to adapt the form you have to
 

229
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,110
in order to adapt the form you have to
be able to tell what is constructing

230
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
be able to tell what is constructing
 

231
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,230
be able to tell what is constructing
this equilibrium

232
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
this equilibrium
 

233
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,629
this equilibrium
so that you can deconstruct it so we'll

234
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
so that you can deconstruct it so we'll
 

235
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,390
so that you can deconstruct it so we'll
scoot back

236
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
scoot back
 

237
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,550
scoot back
and he's here and we're gonna look at

238
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
and he's here and we're gonna look at
 

239
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,510
and he's here and we're gonna look at
that foot

240
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
that foot
 

241
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,710
that foot
okay so uh right now he's

242
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
okay so uh right now he's
 

243
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,670
okay so uh right now he's
he's balancing between my my grip and

244
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
he's balancing between my my grip and
 

245
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,830
he's balancing between my my grip and
that foot

246
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
that foot
 

247
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,110
that foot
okay so a lot of you will just

248
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
okay so a lot of you will just
 

249
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,590
okay so a lot of you will just
kind of like turn like this you see

250
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600

 

251
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,270

so you're going and you turn the guy

252
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
so you're going and you turn the guy
 

253
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,550
so you're going and you turn the guy
but now we're in gus then he can

254
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
but now we're in gus then he can
 

255
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,710
but now we're in gus then he can
he'll get out of it if he wants

256
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720

 

257
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,430

so once you uh pin the foot do you feel

258
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
so once you uh pin the foot do you feel
 

259
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,469
so once you uh pin the foot do you feel
like this

260
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
like this
 

261
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,309
like this
okay so he's he's gonna try to uh walk

262
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
okay so he's he's gonna try to uh walk
 

263
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:20,870
okay so he's he's gonna try to uh walk
on that

264
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
on that
 

265
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,990
on that
foot it's very hard to do but when you

266
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
foot it's very hard to do but when you
 

267
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,830
foot it's very hard to do but when you
do that momentum throws

268
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
do that momentum throws
 

269
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,870
do that momentum throws
he's actually it's him it's him

270
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
he's actually it's him it's him
 

271
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,950
he's actually it's him it's him
that decided not to move his foot and so

272
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
that decided not to move his foot and so
 

273
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,870
that decided not to move his foot and so
when you go to g was that he gets his

274
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
when you go to g was that he gets his
 

275
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,950
when you go to g was that he gets his
decision back

276
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
decision back
 

277
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,350
decision back
do you understand so there has to be a

278
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
do you understand so there has to be a
 

279
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,749
do you understand so there has to be a
pin on the on the foot

280
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759

 

281
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,950

can't be here you can keep walking and

282
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
can't be here you can keep walking and
 

283
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,590
can't be here you can keep walking and
you can you can even if i go low if

284
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
you can you can even if i go low if
 

285
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,749
you can you can even if i go low if
there's no pin on on the foot it doesn't

286
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
there's no pin on on the foot it doesn't
 

287
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,189
there's no pin on on the foot it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter

288
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
matter it doesn't matter
 

289
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,710
matter it doesn't matter
and it doesn't matter if i go fast

290
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720

 

291
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,790

that that foot has woo has to be pinned

292
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
that that foot has woo has to be pinned
 

293
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,230
that that foot has woo has to be pinned
cannot be movable so

294
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
cannot be movable so
 

295
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,909
cannot be movable so
i pin the foot and then my next energy

296
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
i pin the foot and then my next energy
 

297
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,950
i pin the foot and then my next energy
has to go past that so

298
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
has to go past that so
 

299
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,230
has to go past that so
i don't go uh just here

300
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
i don't go uh just here
 

301
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,029
i don't go uh just here
it's got to go past

302
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039

 

303
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,430

and the best way of going past is it at

304
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
and the best way of going past is it at
 

305
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,589
and the best way of going past is it at
a vector

306
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
a vector
 

307
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,830
a vector
uh different from his forward progress

308
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
uh different from his forward progress
 

309
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,629
uh different from his forward progress
so i don't go this way

310
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639

 

311
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,120

but

312
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,130

 

313
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,790

[Music]

314
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
[Music]
 

315
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,869
[Music]
so you deal with that all the time

316
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
so you deal with that all the time
 

317
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,790
so you deal with that all the time
he's down

318
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800

 

319
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,749

and that's what he's dealing with here

320
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
and that's what he's dealing with here
 

321
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,390
and that's what he's dealing with here
so

322
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
so
 

323
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,749
so
as he goes up we're gonna go slow

324
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
as he goes up we're gonna go slow
 

325
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,869
as he goes up we're gonna go slow
then he should feel that foot and he'll

326
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
then he should feel that foot and he'll
 

327
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,469
then he should feel that foot and he'll
feel when i get on the

328
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
feel when i get on the
 

329
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,869
feel when i get on the
other side of that articulation

330
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
other side of that articulation
 

331
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,670
other side of that articulation
do you know what i mean so he i go up

332
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
do you know what i mean so he i go up
 

333
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,309
do you know what i mean so he i go up
i'm still

334
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
i'm still
 

335
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,510
i'm still
on this side of that fulcrum

336
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
on this side of that fulcrum
 

337
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,589
on this side of that fulcrum
but there's going to be a time when my

338
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
but there's going to be a time when my
 

339
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,950
but there's going to be a time when my
center of gravity is on the

340
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
center of gravity is on the
 

341
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,629
center of gravity is on the
other side of that fold

342
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639

 

343
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,390

so we're going to now incorporate the

344
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
so we're going to now incorporate the
 

345
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,909
so we're going to now incorporate the
arm drop

346
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
arm drop
 

347
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,510
arm drop
and at this point in every point where

348
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
and at this point in every point where
 

349
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,749
and at this point in every point where
my line of gravity is on

350
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
my line of gravity is on
 

351
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,950
my line of gravity is on
that side of my front knee

352
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
that side of my front knee
 

353
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,949
that side of my front knee
he's not pulling he's just checking

354
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
he's not pulling he's just checking
 

355
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,509
he's not pulling he's just checking
he's getting ready so he's going to feel

356
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
he's getting ready so he's going to feel
 

357
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,870
he's getting ready so he's going to feel
and when he feels me coming over

358
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
and when he feels me coming over
 

359
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,670
and when he feels me coming over
that's when he adds the arm drag to the

360
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
that's when he adds the arm drag to the
 

361
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,310
that's when he adds the arm drag to the
knee pull

362
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
knee pull
 

363
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,670
knee pull
though

364
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680

 

365
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,790

to pull the arm with my weight on the

366
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
to pull the arm with my weight on the
 

367
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,590
to pull the arm with my weight on the
other side

368
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
other side
 

369
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,790
other side
is a yang yang clash

370
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
is a yang yang clash
 

371
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,990
is a yang yang clash
and it's mechanically inferior so

372
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
and it's mechanically inferior so
 

373
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,030
and it's mechanically inferior so
he goes let's say he does the thing and

374
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
he goes let's say he does the thing and
 

375
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,710
he goes let's say he does the thing and
he goes to pull the arm he's gonna find

376
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
he goes to pull the arm he's gonna find
 

377
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,110
he goes to pull the arm he's gonna find
that's

378
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
that's
 

379
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,870
that's
really heavy and i can get a lot of

380
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
really heavy and i can get a lot of
 

381
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,150
really heavy and i can get a lot of
resistance in there

382
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
resistance in there
 

383
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,030
resistance in there
because i can continue to ground vector

384
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
because i can continue to ground vector
 

385
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,910
because i can continue to ground vector
off of that

386
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
off of that
 

387
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,829
off of that
front part of my leg so he has to get my

388
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
front part of my leg so he has to get my
 

389
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,070
front part of my leg so he has to get my
line of gravity going forward

390
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
line of gravity going forward
 

391
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,470
line of gravity going forward
you can even you can take you want to

392
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
you can even you can take you want to
 

393
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,470
you can even you can take you want to
keep any slack out

394
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
keep any slack out
 

395
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,750
keep any slack out
yet you're just not pulling on it

396
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
yet you're just not pulling on it
 

397
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,910
yet you're just not pulling on it
so if i'm letting you move it you move

398
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
so if i'm letting you move it you move
 

399
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,509
so if i'm letting you move it you move
it but you don't

400
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
it but you don't
 

401
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,190
it but you don't
pull me into that front post

402
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
pull me into that front post
 

403
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,829
pull me into that front post
he goes you'll feel it that's when he

404
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
he goes you'll feel it that's when he
 

405
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,550
he goes you'll feel it that's when he
goes

406
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560

 

407
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,070

so he's doing the first drill up float

408
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
so he's doing the first drill up float
 

409
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,030
so he's doing the first drill up float
pump pull and it's more of a push really

410
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
pump pull and it's more of a push really
 

411
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,389
pump pull and it's more of a push really
when you think about it

412
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
when you think about it
 

413
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,829
when you think about it
let's go okay so he's

414
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
let's go okay so he's
 

415
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,310
let's go okay so he's
uh dealing with all this we're going to

416
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
uh dealing with all this we're going to
 

417
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,829
uh dealing with all this we're going to
add the arm direct

418
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
add the arm direct
 

419
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,069
add the arm direct
boom and his goal here is to get my head

420
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
boom and his goal here is to get my head
 

421
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,590
boom and his goal here is to get my head
as low as possible so he doesn't want me

422
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
as low as possible so he doesn't want me
 

423
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,870
as low as possible so he doesn't want me
here

424
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
here
 

425
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,750
here
low as possible with a certain point

426
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
low as possible with a certain point
 

427
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,069
low as possible with a certain point
this

428
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
this
 

429
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,310
this
is going to pass into his grips are

430
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
is going to pass into his grips are
 

431
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,389
is going to pass into his grips are
going to pass into a hidden phase

432
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
going to pass into a hidden phase
 

433
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,829
going to pass into a hidden phase
and so he has to be able to transfer

434
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
and so he has to be able to transfer
 

435
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,389
and so he has to be able to transfer
over

436
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
over
 

437
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,470
over
to a new grid okay what i mean by that

438
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
to a new grid okay what i mean by that
 

439
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,870
to a new grid okay what i mean by that
is as he goes right now he's in the

440
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
is as he goes right now he's in the
 

441
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,110
is as he goes right now he's in the
young phase it's very hard for me to

442
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
young phase it's very hard for me to
 

443
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,670
young phase it's very hard for me to
pull this

444
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
pull this
 

445
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,630
pull this
back okay but as he goes it starts to go

446
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
back okay but as he goes it starts to go
 

447
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,350
back okay but as he goes it starts to go
yin

448
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
yin
 

449
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,790
yin
again and i can pull my hand back

450
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
again and i can pull my hand back
 

451
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,310
again and i can pull my hand back
okay so he has to transfer over

452
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
okay so he has to transfer over
 

453
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,829
okay so he has to transfer over
and he's going to go into that side

454
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
and he's going to go into that side
 

455
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,350
and he's going to go into that side
scissor okay

456
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
scissor okay
 

457
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,590
scissor okay
and so it's the same concept as he's

458
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
and so it's the same concept as he's
 

459
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,190
and so it's the same concept as he's
trying to be on the top

460
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
trying to be on the top
 

461
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,430
trying to be on the top
the highest part or the longest part of

462
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
the highest part or the longest part of
 

463
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,190
the highest part or the longest part of
my spine as a lever

464
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
my spine as a lever
 

465
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,269
my spine as a lever
he goes and he's going to move

466
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
he goes and he's going to move
 

467
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,110
he goes and he's going to move
over let me fix you and try to get this

468
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
over let me fix you and try to get this
 

469
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,310
over let me fix you and try to get this
knee higher up my back

470
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
knee higher up my back
 

471
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,509
knee higher up my back
to stop me from coming up like i just

472
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
to stop me from coming up like i just
 

473
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,630
to stop me from coming up like i just
did

474
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640

 

475
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,550

he can go to a lap pool too he goes

476
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
he can go to a lap pool too he goes
 

477
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,430
he can go to a lap pool too he goes
we'll pop and he goes over and but it's

478
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
we'll pop and he goes over and but it's
 

479
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,310
we'll pop and he goes over and but it's
about weight

480
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
about weight
 

481
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,509
about weight
on the upper part of my bottom so shift

482
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
on the upper part of my bottom so shift
 

483
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,990
on the upper part of my bottom so shift
all this down

484
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
all this down
 

485
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,710
all this down
lower your hand down it's just very easy

486
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
lower your hand down it's just very easy
 

487
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,150
lower your hand down it's just very easy
for me to reverse them

488
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160

 

489
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,230

it's not enough just to get that side

490
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
it's not enough just to get that side
 

491
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,430
it's not enough just to get that side
scissor so

492
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
scissor so
 

493
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,630
scissor so
elongate feel the sp the knee

494
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
elongate feel the sp the knee
 

495
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,150
elongate feel the sp the knee
then the push as low as possible

496
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
then the push as low as possible
 

497
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,829
then the push as low as possible
and then up high high up on the spine

498
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
and then up high high up on the spine
 

499
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,990
and then up high high up on the spine
not down low on his waist

500
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
not down low on his waist
 

501
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,230
not down low on his waist
up here okay because what i want

502
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
up here okay because what i want
 

503
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,910
up here okay because what i want
is to take advantage of the back

504
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
is to take advantage of the back
 

505
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,150
is to take advantage of the back
exposure so

506
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
exposure so
 

507
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,509
exposure so
look at his head and get your head

508
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
look at his head and get your head
 

509
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,870
look at his head and get your head
higher than his that's going to make the

510
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
higher than his that's going to make the
 

511
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,750
higher than his that's going to make the
back taking

512
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
back taking
 

513
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,590
back taking
advantage of the back exposure much

514
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
advantage of the back exposure much
 

515
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,949
advantage of the back exposure much
easier

516
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
easier
 

517
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,550
easier
so here down

518
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
so here down
 

519
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:18,230
so here down
down here

520
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240

 

521
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,069

up pass boom

522
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
up pass boom
 

523
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,590
up pass boom
up boom here

524
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
up boom here
 

525
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,110
up boom here
get your bottom hip back past

526
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
get your bottom hip back past
 

527
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,150
get your bottom hip back past
the bottom apex so don't have it here

528
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
the bottom apex so don't have it here
 

529
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:43,509
the bottom apex so don't have it here
because he can roll me over

530
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519

 

531
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,470

my bottom hip is gonna turn under and

532
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
my bottom hip is gonna turn under and
 

533
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,829
my bottom hip is gonna turn under and
that's what brings this knee up higher

534
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

535
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,509

oh above his head

536
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
oh above his head
 

537
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,269
oh above his head
weight down down down

538
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
weight down down down
 

539
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,389
weight down down down
okay let's go so as i get

540
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
okay let's go so as i get
 

541
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,389
okay let's go so as i get
there and i'm coming up

542
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
there and i'm coming up
 

543
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,110
there and i'm coming up
you're going to when it when you turn

544
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
you're going to when it when you turn
 

545
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,470
you're going to when it when you turn
this bottom hip

546
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
this bottom hip
 

547
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,069
this bottom hip
more positive it's harder for him to

548
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
more positive it's harder for him to
 

549
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,430
more positive it's harder for him to
roll me over because

550
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
roll me over because
 

551
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,190
roll me over because
my spine is turned over

552
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
my spine is turned over
 

553
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,670
my spine is turned over
or my hips are turned in a positive

554
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
or my hips are turned in a positive
 

555
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,190
or my hips are turned in a positive
angle to my spine

556
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
angle to my spine
 

557
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,509
angle to my spine
so when i'm here like this he can just

558
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
so when i'm here like this he can just
 

559
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,470
so when i'm here like this he can just
reverse the whole thing

560
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
reverse the whole thing
 

561
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,670
reverse the whole thing
but when i'm here like this and i bring

562
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
but when i'm here like this and i bring
 

563
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,670
but when i'm here like this and i bring
more weight up here

564
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
more weight up here
 

565
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,030
more weight up here
and he tries to roll me over i can

566
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
and he tries to roll me over i can
 

567
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,629
and he tries to roll me over i can
cause myself to be in more one piece

568
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
cause myself to be in more one piece
 

569
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,829
cause myself to be in more one piece
and not be so rollable

570
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
and not be so rollable
 

571
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,949
and not be so rollable
that angle that i take on the bottom hip

572
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
that angle that i take on the bottom hip
 

573
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,590
that angle that i take on the bottom hip
is also going to be reinforced by this

574
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
is also going to be reinforced by this
 

575
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,949
is also going to be reinforced by this
hand

576
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
hand
 

577
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,629
hand
so when i seek my elbow to get my head

578
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
so when i seek my elbow to get my head
 

579
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,430
so when i seek my elbow to get my head
over

580
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
over
 

581
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,949
over
i don't want it over here because this

582
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
i don't want it over here because this
 

583
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,509
i don't want it over here because this
is more rollable over

584
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
is more rollable over
 

585
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,590
is more rollable over
i want it where it's going to brace my

586
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
i want it where it's going to brace my
 

587
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,910
i want it where it's going to brace my
other efforts okay but be cognizant that

588
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
other efforts okay but be cognizant that
 

589
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,470
other efforts okay but be cognizant that
the more space you create

590
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
the more space you create
 

591
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,590
the more space you create
the more maneuverability he has so

592
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
the more maneuverability he has so
 

593
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,949
the more maneuverability he has so
this for example would be a great

594
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
this for example would be a great
 

595
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,069
this for example would be a great
reinforcement to the bottom hip but

596
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
reinforcement to the bottom hip but
 

597
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,389
reinforcement to the bottom hip but
it's going to take away from my efforts

598
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
it's going to take away from my efforts
 

599
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,470
it's going to take away from my efforts
so you got to find that place where

600
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
so you got to find that place where
 

601
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,829
so you got to find that place where
it's going to work okay and then

602
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
it's going to work okay and then
 

603
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,629
it's going to work okay and then
immediately i'm going to add more weight

604
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
immediately i'm going to add more weight
 

605
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,790
immediately i'm going to add more weight
to his body

606
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
to his body
 

607
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,629
to his body
by using his back to focus my hips

608
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
by using his back to focus my hips
 

609
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,629
by using his back to focus my hips
off the ground so not my hand

610
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
off the ground so not my hand
 

611
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,790
off the ground so not my hand
but my leg here

612
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
but my leg here
 

613
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,310
but my leg here
the only reason my hand gets extended my

614
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
the only reason my hand gets extended my
 

615
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,110
the only reason my hand gets extended my
arm

616
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
arm
 

617
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,150
arm
is that i want to keep my head above his

618
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
is that i want to keep my head above his
 

619
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,949
is that i want to keep my head above his
head

620
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
head
 

621
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,750
head
so if i could keep my head above his

622
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
so if i could keep my head above his
 

623
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,949
so if i could keep my head above his
head

624
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
head
 

625
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,509
head
without having to extend my arm i might

626
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
without having to extend my arm i might
 

627
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,550
without having to extend my arm i might
do that

628
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
do that
 

629
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,470
do that
but definitely i'm not going to go like

630
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
but definitely i'm not going to go like
 

631
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,069
but definitely i'm not going to go like
this

632
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
this
 

633
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,629
this
i'm going to take this weight and drive

634
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
i'm going to take this weight and drive
 

635
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,350
i'm going to take this weight and drive
it down into him

636
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
it down into him
 

637
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,269
it down into him
so don't take that weight off when you

638
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
so don't take that weight off when you
 

639
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,710
so don't take that weight off when you
come to your hand

640
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
come to your hand
 

641
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,389
come to your hand
so it goes one and then my hand and she

642
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
so it goes one and then my hand and she
 

643
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,949
so it goes one and then my hand and she
should feel

644
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
should feel
 

645
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,910
should feel
more weight when i come to that hand not

646
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
more weight when i come to that hand not
 

647
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,310
more weight when i come to that hand not
less

648
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
less
 

649
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,189
less
weight because i'm back over here so

650
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
weight because i'm back over here so
 

651
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,470
weight because i'm back over here so
more weight

652
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
more weight
 

653
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,790
more weight
under his head

654
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800

 

655
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,829

still working with weight on the distal

656
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
still working with weight on the distal
 

657
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,430
still working with weight on the distal
end of his spine

658
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440

 

659
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,710

up keep the hand from posting

660
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
up keep the hand from posting
 

661
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,710
up keep the hand from posting
just pin it wait on his head

662
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
just pin it wait on his head
 

663
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,310
just pin it wait on his head
take him into the front

664
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320

 

665
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,590

inward kazushi okay let's go

666
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600

 

667
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,069

the skill review again i'm going to try

668
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
the skill review again i'm going to try
 

669
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,910
the skill review again i'm going to try
the knee pull and the arm drag

670
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
the knee pull and the arm drag
 

671
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,790
the knee pull and the arm drag
and it's even though i'm on the positive

672
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
and it's even though i'm on the positive
 

673
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,990
and it's even though i'm on the positive
side of his

674
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
side of his
 

675
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,389
side of his
line of gravity and his base of support

676
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
line of gravity and his base of support
 

677
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,509
line of gravity and his base of support
people are strong

678
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
people are strong
 

679
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,629
people are strong
so they pull they can pull it in

680
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
so they pull they can pull it in
 

681
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,990
so they pull they can pull it in
okay so we're going to use that for the

682
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
okay so we're going to use that for the
 

683
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,269
okay so we're going to use that for the
triangle opening

684
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
triangle opening
 

685
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,110
triangle opening
so boom he pulls

686
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
so boom he pulls
 

687
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,110
so boom he pulls
i'm going to shove it in

688
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
i'm going to shove it in
 

689
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,230
i'm going to shove it in
and then come on top of the trapezius

690
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
and then come on top of the trapezius
 

691
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,590
and then come on top of the trapezius
but in order to do that i have to keep

692
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
but in order to do that i have to keep
 

693
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,110
but in order to do that i have to keep
this in place and that's what i use

694
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
this in place and that's what i use
 

695
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,829
this in place and that's what i use
to fulfill my hips up

696
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839

 

697
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,470

so we'll go slow so you can see i'm

698
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
so we'll go slow so you can see i'm
 

699
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,269
so we'll go slow so you can see i'm
trying it

700
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
trying it
 

701
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,389
trying it
i'll feel it i go with the energy keep

702
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
i'll feel it i go with the energy keep
 

703
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:52,790
i'll feel it i go with the energy keep
this

704
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
this
 

705
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,350
this
in place use that to lift my hips

706
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
in place use that to lift my hips
 

707
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,790
in place use that to lift my hips
back of my knee is on the trapezius

708
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
back of my knee is on the trapezius
 

709
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,030
back of my knee is on the trapezius
heel comes down and i'm applying the

710
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
heel comes down and i'm applying the
 

711
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,789
heel comes down and i'm applying the
same concept of b

712
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
same concept of b
 

713
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,909
same concept of b
on the distal end of his spine so you

714
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
on the distal end of his spine so you
 

715
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,789
on the distal end of his spine so you
see

716
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
see
 

717
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,789
see
that i still have the same knee pulling

718
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
that i still have the same knee pulling
 

719
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,789
that i still have the same knee pulling
action okay i'm not down here

720
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
action okay i'm not down here
 

721
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,270
action okay i'm not down here
or up here pulling him in

722
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280

 

723
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,710

knee pulling he fights it boom over the

724
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
knee pulling he fights it boom over the
 

725
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,990
knee pulling he fights it boom over the
top i go

726
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
top i go
 

727
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,350
top i go
back on the distal end okay

728
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
back on the distal end okay
 

729
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,990
back on the distal end okay
here let's get it there's not there's

730
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
here let's get it there's not there's
 

731
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,150
here let's get it there's not there's
not two arcs

732
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
not two arcs
 

733
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,310
not two arcs
so uh as as i'm on the outside i can go

734
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
so uh as as i'm on the outside i can go
 

735
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,870
so uh as as i'm on the outside i can go
on the

736
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
on the
 

737
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,150
on the
inside okay as as i'm on the

738
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
inside okay as as i'm on the
 

739
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,870
inside okay as as i'm on the
inside i can go to the outside so we're

740
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
inside i can go to the outside so we're
 

741
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,549
inside i can go to the outside so we're
just going to play around

742
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
just going to play around
 

743
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,870
just going to play around
and you'll see that i can change

744
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
and you'll see that i can change
 

745
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,190
and you'll see that i can change
positions going from one

746
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
positions going from one
 

747
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,190
positions going from one
one hand inside out
