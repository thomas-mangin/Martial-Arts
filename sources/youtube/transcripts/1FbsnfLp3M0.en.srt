00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,769
from them clashing into your arm you
have to wait for that energy to go up or

324
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:41,779
have to wait for that energy to go up or

sometimes you don't do the IDI Miyoshi

326
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,110
sometimes you don't do the IDI Miyoshi
 

327
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,199
sometimes you don't do the IDI Miyoshi
because you can't move anymore forward

328
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:47,209
because you can't move anymore forward
 

329
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,850
because you can't move anymore forward
because you've clashed with them those

330
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:48,860
because you've clashed with them those
 

331
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,150
because you've clashed with them those
are all signs of that and and why is

332
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
are all signs of that and and why is
 

333
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,410
are all signs of that and and why is
that happening because musubi cannot

334
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:56,420
that happening because musubi cannot
 

335
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,650
that happening because musubi cannot
truly exist at a material level first

at that level of intention you're going
to have to have connection you're going

to have to have connection you're going
 

351
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,910
to have to have connection you're going
to have to have union prior to even that

352
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:30,920
to have to have union prior to even that
 

353
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,949
to have to have union prior to even that
I'm just saying if you don't have a by

so it only looks like you're moving
 

415
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,360
so it only looks like you're moving
ahead and you're not really moving first

ahead and you're not really moving first

for a head and as you train more you'll

418
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,290
for a head and as you train more you'll
 

419
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,760
for a head and as you train more you'll
start to see that usually it gets first

start to see that usually it gets first

first experience of it or usually a

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,870
first experience of it or usually a
beginner student will experience it

424
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:15,880
beginner student will experience it
 

425
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,330
beginner student will experience it
first as you can and do so in the

first as you can and do so in the
 

427
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,940
first as you can and do so in the
following way it'll be some training

would be but I moved when you had the

would be but I moved when you had the
 

441
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,490
would be but I moved when you had the
intention and it's gonna take you about

442
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:38,500
intention and it's gonna take you about
 

443
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,710
intention and it's gonna take you about
three-quarters of a second to change

444

three-quarters of a second to change
 

445
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,200
three-quarters of a second to change
plans and and so I remembered that as

446
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,210
plans and and so I remembered that as
 

447
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,500
plans and and so I remembered that as
as the as it okay with my teachers

448

you're like you throw it and you already

450
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:49,670
you're like you throw it and you already
 

451
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,170
you're like you throw it and you already
go ah crap things they moved out of the

452
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,180
go ah crap things they moved out of the
 

453
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,260
go ah crap things they moved out of the
way because they were already United

454
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,270
way because they were already United
 

455
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,910
way because they were already United
with you and if you saw the little

456
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
with you and if you saw the little
 

457
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,829
with you and if you saw the little
demonstration there that is all I'm

458
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
demonstration there that is all I'm
 

459
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
demonstration there that is all I'm
doing it's really cheating because they

460
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,050
doing it's really cheating because they
 

461
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,660
doing it's really cheating because they
keep going where I want them to go but I

462
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:07,670
keep going where I want them to go but I
 

463
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,400
keep going where I want them to go but I
make where they're going where I want

464
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,410
make where they're going where I want
 

465
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,430
make where they're going where I want
them to go because I'm not there anymore

466
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
them to go because I'm not there anymore
 

467
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,550
them to go because I'm not there anymore
you get that and so it looks easy but

468
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
you get that and so it looks easy but
 

469
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,800
you get that and so it looks easy but
that part of uniting across space and

470
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:17,810
that part of uniting across space and
 

471
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,780
that part of uniting across space and
time that part's not easy that takes a

472
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,790
time that part's not easy that takes a
 

473
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,790
time that part's not easy that takes a
long time to train which is why for

474
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:21,800
long time to train which is why for
 

475
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,269
long time to train which is why for
example when we do weapons to training I

have that person drawing in front of you
I don't you get I want you to get used

480
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,660
I don't you get I want you to get used
 

481
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,019
I don't you get I want you to get used

is how do I move forward okay and then

642
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,470
is how do I move forward okay and then
 

643
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,920
is how do I move forward okay and then
begin Tenkaichi is going to be hard

644
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:48,930
begin Tenkaichi is going to be hard
 

645
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,990
begin Tenkaichi is going to be hard
right rotate and it's a question how do

646
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
right rotate and it's a question how do
 

647
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,710
right rotate and it's a question how do
I move forward while being grounded and

648
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:53,720
I move forward while being grounded and
 

649
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,450
I move forward while being grounded and
how do I turn well being grounded or how

650
00:16:59,450 --> 00:16:59,460
how do I turn well being grounded or how
 

651
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,380
how do I turn well being grounded or how
do I move forward while being grounded

652
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,390
do I move forward while being grounded
 

653
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,290
do I move forward while being grounded
and having my upper torso body

654
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,300
and having my upper torso body
 

655
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,380
and having my upper torso body
organization right be a part of it or

656
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,390
organization right be a part of it or
 

657
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,040
organization right be a part of it or
again how do I turn be grounded such

658
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,050
again how do I turn be grounded such
 

659
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,540
again how do I turn be grounded such
that I can have my upper body

660
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:14,550
that I can have my upper body
 

661
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,080
that I can have my upper body
organization

662
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,090
organization
 

663
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,570
organization
so we haven't had that video yet but hey

664
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:19,580
so we haven't had that video yet but hey
 

665
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,280
so we haven't had that video yet but hey
what do you know about East Asian

666
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,290
what do you know about East Asian
 

667
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,370
what do you know about East Asian
philosophy its Yin there's Yin and

668
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:24,380
philosophy its Yin there's Yin and
 

669
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,830
philosophy its Yin there's Yin and
there's young okay and inside of young

670
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:26,840
there's young okay and inside of young
 

671
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,410
there's young okay and inside of young
there's what a little bit of Yin and

672
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:29,420
there's what a little bit of Yin and
 

673
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,690
there's what a little bit of Yin and
inside of Yin there's a little bit of

674
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:31,700
inside of Yin there's a little bit of
 

675
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,180
inside of Yin there's a little bit of
okay and so they're basically the same

676
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,190
okay and so they're basically the same
 

677
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,610
okay and so they're basically the same
essences but coming from a different

678
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:36,620
essences but coming from a different
 

679
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,500
essences but coming from a different
perspective so if you take the what

680
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,510
perspective so if you take the what
 

681
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,500
perspective so if you take the what
we're calling the mid-foot waiting right

682
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,510
we're calling the mid-foot waiting right
 

683
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,910
we're calling the mid-foot waiting right
and we establish that in an Annie angle

684
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:48,920
and we establish that in an Annie angle
 

685
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,950
and we establish that in an Annie angle
or an ankle angle that goes from right

686
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
or an ankle angle that goes from right
 

687
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,720
or an ankle angle that goes from right
angle to right no further than the toes

688
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:55,730
angle to right no further than the toes
 

689
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,960
angle to right no further than the toes
remember that okay and we use that to

690
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,970
remember that okay and we use that to
 

691
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,510
remember that okay and we use that to
move forward we're gonna use that to

692
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
move forward we're gonna use that to
 

693
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,420
move forward we're gonna use that to
turn now when you do that if I was using

694
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,430
turn now when you do that if I was using
 

695
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,580
turn now when you do that if I was using
that to move forward I was establishing

696
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:06,590
that to move forward I was establishing
 

697
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,430
that to move forward I was establishing
a weighted single point that I was using

698
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
a weighted single point that I was using
 

699
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,130
a weighted single point that I was using
to propel me forward right and what did

700
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,140
to propel me forward right and what did
 

701
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,110
to propel me forward right and what did
I say we need to turn properly a

702
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,120
I say we need to turn properly a
 

703
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,480
I say we need to turn properly a
weighted single point okay so the in

704
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,490
weighted single point okay so the in
 

705
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,140
weighted single point okay so the in
Tenkasi is going to be okay establish a

706
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,150
Tenkasi is going to be okay establish a
 

707
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,750
Tenkasi is going to be okay establish a
weighted single point and we're gonna do

708
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
weighted single point and we're gonna do
 

709
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,290
weighted single point and we're gonna do
it using annotation so you you already

710
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,300
it using annotation so you you already
 

711
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,760
it using annotation so you you already
know it but it's one of those things

712
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:33,770
know it but it's one of those things
 

713
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,460
know it but it's one of those things
right - no it's not enough right I have

714
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:36,470
right - no it's not enough right I have
 

715
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,010
right - no it's not enough right I have
to go know it right and I have to be

716
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,020
to go know it right and I have to be
 

717
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,290
to go know it right and I have to be
able to do it so we need reps okay well

718
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:44,300
able to do it so we need reps okay well
 

719
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,080
able to do it so we need reps okay well
you could figure it out and we have

720
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,090
you could figure it out and we have
 

721
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,010
you could figure it out and we have
covered it in the past

722
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,020
covered it in the past
 

723
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,150
covered it in the past
we just haven't covered

724
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
we just haven't covered
 

725
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,549
we just haven't covered
nor have we put it on video babe it'll

726
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:53,559
nor have we put it on video babe it'll
 

727
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,440
nor have we put it on video babe it'll
be there for you to see but if you go

728
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,450
be there for you to see but if you go
 

729
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,460
be there for you to see but if you go
back to the young video I think you

730
00:18:59,460 --> 00:18:59,470
back to the young video I think you
 

731
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,990
back to the young video I think you
could piece it together because either

732
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,000
could piece it together because either
 

733
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,289
could piece it together because either
there when we've done the Tenkaichi and

734
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:04,299
there when we've done the Tenkaichi and
 

735
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,510
there when we've done the Tenkaichi and
the ten Connolly and all that stuff we

736
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:06,520
the ten Connolly and all that stuff we
 

737
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,700
the ten Connolly and all that stuff we
might be able to figure it out now what

738
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:08,710
might be able to figure it out now what
 

739
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,130
might be able to figure it out now what
is the knee bend what is too far what

740
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,140
is the knee bend what is too far what
 

741
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,740
is the knee bend what is too far what
are the limits of the of the ankle angle

742
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:13,750
are the limits of the of the ankle angle
 

743
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,660
are the limits of the of the ankle angle
right where's my weight supposed to be

744
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,670
right where's my weight supposed to be
 

745
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,120
right where's my weight supposed to be
all that's explained in the young video

746
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,130
all that's explained in the young video
 

747
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,730
all that's explained in the young video
and if you tie that to the drills that

748
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:20,740
and if you tie that to the drills that
 

749
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,039
and if you tie that to the drills that
you've done in the past it's very

750
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,049
you've done in the past it's very
 

751
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,230
you've done in the past it's very
sensei's drills you'll figure you should

752
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,240
sensei's drills you'll figure you should
 

753
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,360
sensei's drills you'll figure you should
be able to figure but we'll soon get it

754
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,370
be able to figure but we'll soon get it
 

755
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,789
be able to figure but we'll soon get it
on video we were gonna do it tonight but

756
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:29,799
on video we were gonna do it tonight but
 

757
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,320
on video we were gonna do it tonight but
when the way I was watching you guys

758
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,330
when the way I was watching you guys
 

759
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,570
when the way I was watching you guys
take time to hand code we needed to work

760
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:33,580
take time to hand code we needed to work
 

761
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:44,359
take time to hand code we needed to work
more on this body organization

762
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:44,369

 

763
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:49,890

yeah I think I've been stuck on thinking

764
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:49,900
yeah I think I've been stuck on thinking
 

765
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:58,680
yeah I think I've been stuck on thinking
understand it rather than just I think

766
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:58,690
understand it rather than just I think
 

767
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,020
understand it rather than just I think
it's related I think in some ways an

768
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,030
it's related I think in some ways an
 

769
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,250
it's related I think in some ways an
over intellectualization of our our

770
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,260
over intellectualization of our our
 

771
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,200
over intellectualization of our our
existence is about a type of

772
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,210
existence is about a type of
 

773
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,860
existence is about a type of
unreconciled fear and I think an

774
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:12,870
unreconciled fear and I think an
 

775
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,020
unreconciled fear and I think an
unreconciled fear is often an obstacle

776
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,030
unreconciled fear is often an obstacle
 

777
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,500
unreconciled fear is often an obstacle
to faith so I think there is some

778
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,510
to faith so I think there is some
 

779
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,230
to faith so I think there is some
relationship there but you know I don't

780
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
relationship there but you know I don't
 

781
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,860
relationship there but you know I don't
think it's necessarily a modern human

782
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:25,870
think it's necessarily a modern human
 

783
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,080
think it's necessarily a modern human
problem it just might be a modern

784
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,090
problem it just might be a modern
 

785
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,420
problem it just might be a modern
problem I mean a problem a human problem

786
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,430
problem I mean a problem a human problem
 

787
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,610
problem I mean a problem a human problem
because if you look at the historical

788
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:32,620
because if you look at the historical
 

789
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,540
because if you look at the historical
record there there are constant stories

790
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:36,550
record there there are constant stories
 

791
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,970
record there there are constant stories
