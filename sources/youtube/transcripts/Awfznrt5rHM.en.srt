137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,270

138
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
and so how do you how do you do it is
 

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,430

00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
you're not doing some weird thing like
 

151
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,270
you're not doing some weird thing like
this

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
this
 

153
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,510
this
because that's when the person does not

154
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
because that's when the person does not
 

155
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,029

uh they sometimes turn

156
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
uh they sometimes turn
 

157
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,070
uh they sometimes turn
under you so you're going like this and

158
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
under you so you're going like this and
 

159
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,790

they won't
 

161
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,950

here go down
and the person that turns like that ends

172
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
and the person that turns like that ends
 

173
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,909
and the person that turns like that ends
up on the wrong side of the back right
