55
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,410
long okay so as you watch there's
there's a small slow gradual deviation

56
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:38,420
there's a small slow gradual deviation
 

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,540

to the to the line on the other one it's
 

59
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,199
to the to the line on the other one it's
going to be a more immediate shifting

60
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,209
going to be a more immediate shifting
 

61
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,930

you can test would you like to have kid

192
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:49,379
you can test would you like to have kid
 

193
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,869
you can test would you like to have kid
and young behaviors okay so when we're

194
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:53,879
and young behaviors okay so when we're
 

195
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,049
and young behaviors okay so when we're
here like this and he's pushing and I

196
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:57,059
here like this and he's pushing and I
 

197
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:02,420
here like this and he's pushing and I
move you've seen his balance go I go

198
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,430
move you've seen his balance go I go
 

199
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,869
move you've seen his balance go I go
like this I might feel hold him up so he

200
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
like this I might feel hold him up so he
 

201
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,600
like this I might feel hold him up so he
were here and I went up boom

202
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,610

 

203
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,350

but when I when I hit here I'm grounded

204
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
but when I when I hit here I'm grounded
 

205
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,780
but when I when I hit here I'm grounded
on the back foot the back foot is ground

206
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:18,790
on the back foot the back foot is ground
 

207
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,900
on the back foot the back foot is ground
you say he's pushy and I can't reject

208
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,910
you say he's pushy and I can't reject
 

209
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,820
you say he's pushy and I can't reject
off of the back foot so not like this

210
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:26,830
off of the back foot so not like this
 

211
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,970
off of the back foot so not like this
where I get up around my not that thing

212
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:29,980
where I get up around my not that thing
 

213
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,660
where I get up around my not that thing
on this corner I actually live why then

214
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:36,670
on this corner I actually live why then
 

215
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:55,820
on this corner I actually live why then
the next one when I come forward

216
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:55,830

 

217
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:03,990

so then younggu okay let's try here and

218
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
so then younggu okay let's try here and
 

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:21,360
so then younggu okay let's try here and
I move that's the deviation so we're

220
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,370
I move that's the deviation so we're
 

221
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,060
I move that's the deviation so we're
just doing it slow I'm gonna free this

222
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,070
just doing it slow I'm gonna free this
 

223
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,310
just doing it slow I'm gonna free this
space if you see I'm not free he's

224
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,320
space if you see I'm not free he's
 

225
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,180
space if you see I'm not free he's
moving me

226
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,190
moving me
 

227
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,610
moving me

going to happen not after I go through
 

237
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,420
going to happen not after I go through
and accelerate here deviate then set it

238
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,430
and accelerate here deviate then set it

shoving him here so the line okay it's
 

249
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,720
shoving him here so the line okay it's
still pushing on you see that okay so

250
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:29,730
still pushing on you see that okay so
 

251
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,000
still pushing on you see that okay so
what you're doing is your center of

252

gravity is between your two feet that's
 

255
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,800
gravity is between your two feet that's
why I'm still pushing on you until you

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:36,810
why I'm still pushing on you until you
 

257
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,850
why I'm still pushing on you until you
move out of the way with that bathroom

it looks like it works the only problem

260
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:42,930
it looks like it works the only problem
 

261
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,100
it looks like it works the only problem
is when I'm here and I go quicker boom I

262
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,110
is when I'm here and I go quicker boom I
 

263
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,780
is when I'm here and I go quicker boom I
control where that lot of gravity is

264
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:50,790
control where that lot of gravity is
 

265
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,810
control where that lot of gravity is
actually going to give you the radius

266
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:53,820
actually going to give you the radius
 

267
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,930
actually going to give you the radius
distance my you need watch I'm going to
