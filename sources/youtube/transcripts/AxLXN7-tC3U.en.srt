why make it complicated when it can be

1100
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
why make it complicated when it can be

simple
 

1103
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,190
simple
so why

1104
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
so why
 

1105
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,070
so why
do this now go around his back bring him

around here and
 

1109
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,630
around here and
do so

1110
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
do so

1113
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,510

see so to me that makes sense and that's

1114
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
see so to me that makes sense and that's
 

1115

i could have a lot of contradictions
 

1119
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,070
i could have a lot of contradictions
but that doesn't contradict itself you

1120
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
but that doesn't contradict itself you
 

1121
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,029
but that doesn't contradict itself you
see

1122
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
see
 

1123
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,830
see
so i'm not saying to anybody change your

you must make a lot of decisions in a
 

1159
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,070
you must make a lot of decisions in a
day you know common sense ones you must

1160
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
day you know common sense ones you must
 

1161
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,630
day you know common sense ones you must
have to decide sometimes under pressure

1162
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
have to decide sometimes under pressure
 

1163
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,909
have to decide sometimes under pressure
and yeah we're sort of a little bit

1164
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
and yeah we're sort of a little bit
 

1165
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,470
and yeah we're sort of a little bit
in front of an aikido master you know

1166
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
in front of an aikido master you know
 

1167
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,430
in front of an aikido master you know
wow

1168
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
wow
 

1169
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,190
wow
look what you can do

1170
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
look what you can do
 

1171
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,830
look what you can do
so we've become stupid when it comes to

1172
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
so we've become stupid when it comes to
 

1173
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,909
so we've become stupid when it comes to
logic

1174
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
logic
 

1175
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,750
logic
so today is all about saying

1176
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
so today is all about saying
 

1177
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,870
so today is all about saying
would you

1178
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
would you
 

1179
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,029
would you
if he'd got a sword in his hand

1180
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
if he'd got a sword in his hand
 

1181
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,750
if he'd got a sword in his hand
slowly would i would i

1182
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
slowly would i would i
 

1183
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,909
slowly would i would i
do because well yeah but i'd do a

1184
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
do because well yeah but i'd do a
 

1185
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,269
do because well yeah but i'd do a
different technique that's see that's

1186
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
different technique that's see that's
 

1187
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,870
different technique that's see that's
what people said to me over the years

1188
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
what people said to me over the years
 

1189
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,029
what people said to me over the years
yeah i do a different technique i go but

1190
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
yeah i do a different technique i go but
 

1191
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,230
yeah i do a different technique i go but
why don't you do a different one if it's

1192
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
why don't you do a different one if it's
 

1193
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,110
why don't you do a different one if it's
easier in the beginning see that's my

1194
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
easier in the beginning see that's my
 

1195
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,909
easier in the beginning see that's my
bluntness and that's my childishness of

1196
00:23:59,909 --> 00:23:59,919
bluntness and that's my childishness of
 

1197
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,070
bluntness and that's my childishness of
why make it difficult if you don't have

1198
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
why make it difficult if you don't have
 

1199
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,430
why make it difficult if you don't have
to

1200

how much can you
stop that because that that that's not a

1244
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
stop that because that that that's not a
 

1245
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,390
stop that because that that that's not a
lot of force

1246
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400

 

1247
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,590

so that's it good okay good so the only

1248
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
so that's it good okay good so the only
 

1249
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,750
so that's it good okay good so the only
way he should be thinking of going when

1250
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
way he should be thinking of going when
 

1251
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,149
way he should be thinking of going when
you're done hopefully this technique the

1252
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
you're done hopefully this technique the
 

1253
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,830
you're done hopefully this technique the
only way you should be thinking of going

1254
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
only way you should be thinking of going
 

1255
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,950
only way you should be thinking of going
is

1256
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
is
 

1257
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,510
is
over that way

1258
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
over that way
 

1259
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,710
over that way
he should put himself into the akemi you

1260
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
he should put himself into the akemi you
 

1261
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,190
he should put himself into the akemi you
shouldn't have to do it you know we all

1262
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
shouldn't have to do it you know we all
 

1263
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,950
shouldn't have to do it you know we all
know that you bring the knee through or
