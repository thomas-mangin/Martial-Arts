00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,710
basically everybody tells you to run
away from a knife attacker but silat

162
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
away from a knife attacker but silat
 

163
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,430
away from a knife attacker but silat
takes it one step further usually if you

164
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,440
takes it one step further usually if you
 

165
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,710
takes it one step further usually if you
bring a knife you'll also have other

166
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:15,720
bring a knife you'll also have other
 

167
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,670
bring a knife you'll also have other
people bringing a stick bringing a

168
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
people bringing a stick bringing a
 

169
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,110
people bringing a stick bringing a
pitchfork people have a mob mentality

170
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,120
pitchfork people have a mob mentality
 

171
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,789
pitchfork people have a mob mentality
mob mentality yeah so this is why your

172
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
mob mentality yeah so this is why your
 

173
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,430
mob mentality yeah so this is why your
first goal is to run when you see knife

174
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
first goal is to run when you see knife
 

175
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,390
first goal is to run when you see knife
but make sure you injure someone first

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,400
but make sure you injure someone first
 

177
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,229
but make sure you injure someone first
first really bad yeah so that that's

178
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
first really bad yeah so that that's
 

179
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,110
first really bad yeah so that that's
like the person they need to yeah so

180
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,120
like the person they need to yeah so
 

181
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,149
like the person they need to yeah so

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,589
exactly yeah and then that's dangerous
yeah yeah so the thing is I want to make

314
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:13,599

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
five different places at least from all
 

419
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,230
five different places at least from all
those punches Sor about that but that

420
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
those punches Sor about that but that
 

421
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,870
those punches Sor about that but that
just means it's effective we try not to

422
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:37,880
just means it's effective we try not to
 

423
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,670
just means it's effective we try not to
claim that because different people got

424
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
claim that because different people got
 

425
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,310
claim that because different people got
different realities yeah some people

426
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,320
different realities yeah some people
 

427
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,870
different realities yeah some people
when they take drugs some people when

428
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
when they take drugs some people when
 

429
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,990
when they take drugs some people when
they have alcohol they will not feel it

430
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
they have alcohol they will not feel it
 

431
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,430
they have alcohol they will not feel it
so this is why you hit as much as

432
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:46,440
so this is why you hit as much as
 

433
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,750
so this is why you hit as much as
possible until something breaks yes so

434
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
possible until something breaks yes so
 

435
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,990
possible until something breaks yes so
if I break you at least something worked

436
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
if I break you at least something worked
 

437
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,750
if I break you at least something worked
yes so this is why when people said yeah

438
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:52,760
yes so this is why when people said yeah
 

439
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,110
yes so this is why when people said yeah

defense drill drill drill again our

452
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,480
defense drill drill drill again our
 

453
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,710
defense drill drill drill again our
concept is drill makes skill yes so you

454
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
concept is drill makes skill yes so you
 

455
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,509
concept is drill makes skill yes so you
don't do an empty drill if you're just

456
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:14,519
don't do an empty drill if you're just
 

457
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,590
don't do an empty drill if you're just
doing a drill but there is no

458
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
doing a drill but there is no
 

459
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,269
doing a drill but there is no
application and there's no understanding

460
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
application and there's no understanding
 

461
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,870
application and there's no understanding
behind the drill then it's useless for

462
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
behind the drill then it's useless for
 

463
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,230
behind the drill then it's useless for
example there's only one right you have

464
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,240
example there's only one right you have
 

465
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,550
example there's only one right you have
the slash yeah and then this slash yeah

466
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
the slash yeah and then this slash yeah
 

467
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,750
the slash yeah and then this slash yeah
and then every other angle is just

468
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
and then every other angle is just
 

469
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,509
and then every other angle is just
variation so you could hit me here yeah

470
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
variation so you could hit me here yeah
 

471
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,430
variation so you could hit me here yeah
that if you hit me here yeah if you hit

472
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
that if you hit me here yeah if you hit
 

473
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,550
that if you hit me here yeah if you hit
me here you go here yeah see yeah same

474
