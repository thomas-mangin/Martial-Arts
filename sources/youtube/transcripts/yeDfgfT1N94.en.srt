across this body in this variation I
 

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:36,150
across this body in this variation I
have this pin but it's still going that

142

143
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,230

okay we're going to I'll get to that
 

151
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,909
okay we're going to I'll get to that
part next but see where he is you always

152
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:58,919
part next but see where he is you always
 

153
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,390
part next but see where he is you always
throw him on wonder you if you're going

154
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
throw him on wonder you if you're going
 

155
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,110
throw him on wonder you if you're going
to do a standing pit that's that's where

156
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
to do a standing pit that's that's where
 

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,550
to do a standing pit that's that's where
your Stomps are and your kicks you don't

158
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,560
your Stomps are and your kicks you don't
 

159
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,550
your Stomps are and your kicks you don't
throw him away from you okay and so for

160
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
throw him away from you okay and so for
 

161
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,670
throw him away from you okay and so for
the same

162
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,680
the same
 

163
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,950
the same
reason I'm not going to Ed me and t con

164
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
reason I'm not going to Ed me and t con
 

165
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,430
reason I'm not going to Ed me and t con
because go

166
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
because go
 

167
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,110
because go
back as soon as I ten con I'm not under

168
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
back as soon as I ten con I'm not under
 

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,550
back as soon as I ten con I'm not under
him you think I'm side of him and then

170
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:25,560
him you think I'm side of him and then
 

171
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,510
him you think I'm side of him and then
we already know that that's not going to

172
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
we already know that that's not going to
 

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,309
we already know that that's not going to
work he's just going to go forward or

174
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319

 

175
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,950

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,629

projection then I go around that energy

204
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:27,639

 

205
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,830

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,510

my my kinesthetic index point is that

212
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
my my kinesthetic index point is that
 

213
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,510
my my kinesthetic index point is that
you stay over him

214
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520

 

215

hand over come
 

247
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,589
hand over come
back okay try that try that index point

248
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599
back okay try that try that index point
 

249
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,389
back okay try that try that index point
now we'll do that Amic version okay so

250
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:43,399
now we'll do that Amic version okay so
 

251
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,230
now we'll do that Amic version okay so
the difference

252
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
the difference
 

253
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,430
the difference

this okay so the same step put on your

292
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
this okay so the same step put on your
 

293
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,630
this okay so the same step put on your
hip and it goes to the inside of your

because the hips and legs are way
 

299
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,829
because the hips and legs are way
stronger it comes on way faster and

300
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:08,839
stronger it comes on way faster and
 

301
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:09,949
stronger it comes on way faster and
harder

302
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:09,959
harder

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320

 

429
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,870

do a front brake fall so he'll you don't
 

433
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,110
do a front brake fall so he'll you don't
know what to do so I got to tell you

434
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
know what to do so I got to tell you
 

435
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,749
know what to do so I got to tell you
okay you're going to turn your foot that

436
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:54,759
okay you're going to turn your foot that
 

437
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,749
okay you're going to turn your foot that
way and then there's the fall do you see

438
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:57,759
way and then there's the fall do you see
 

439
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,509
way and then there's the fall do you see
that

440
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
that
 

441
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,230
that
okay but he can't do that because of the

442
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
okay but he can't do that because of the
 

443
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,870
okay but he can't do that because of the
angle cancellation turn your foot you

444
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
angle cancellation turn your foot you
 

445
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,110
angle cancellation turn your foot you
see so usually there's no angle

446
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,120
see so usually there's no angle
 

447
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,030
see so usually there's no angle
cancellation and then he could turn his

448
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,040
cancellation and then he could turn his
 

449
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,910
cancellation and then he could turn his
body that way and then he can do it okay

450
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:14,920
body that way and then he can do it okay
 

451
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,350
body that way and then he can do it okay
but moreover uh people that you're not

452
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,360
but moreover uh people that you're not
 

453
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,470
but moreover uh people that you're not
going to spin someone top to turby with

454
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
going to spin someone top to turby with
 

455
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,430
going to spin someone top to turby with
the wrist joint it doesn't really work

456
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
the wrist joint it doesn't really work
 

457
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,550
the wrist joint it doesn't really work
that way in the street okay um it will

458
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
that way in the street okay um it will
 

459
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,269
that way in the street okay um it will
on the elbow on the shoulder but the

460
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:28,279
on the elbow on the shoulder but the
 

461
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,949
on the elbow on the shoulder but the
wrist joint is just too small to get

462
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
wrist joint is just too small to get
 

463
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,269
wrist joint is just too small to get
that toxy effect

464
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
that toxy effect
 

465
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,110
that toxy effect
okay so this pin here is not going to be

466
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,120
okay so this pin here is not going to be
 

467
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,829
okay so this pin here is not going to be
something that he choreographs into the

468
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839

 

469
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,430

fall then it has to

470
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,440
fall then it has to
 

471
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,230
fall then it has to
work and if you turn that you do the

472
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
work and if you turn that you do the
 

473
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,790
work and if you turn that you do the
next thing that you can get away with

474
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:51,800
next thing that you can get away with
 

475
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,910
next thing that you can get away with
cuz he's going to fall anyways is you're

476
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
cuz he's going to fall anyways is you're
 

477
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,069
cuz he's going to fall anyways is you're
on both sides of the arm do you see that

478
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
on both sides of the arm do you see that
 

479
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:03,350
on both sides of the arm do you see that
of the hand and you kind of just pull it

480
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360

 

481
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,069

well if you get on both sides of the arm

482
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
well if you get on both sides of the arm
 

483
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,629
well if you get on both sides of the arm
if you get on both sides of the hand you

484
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
if you get on both sides of the hand you
 

485
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,030
if you get on both sides of the hand you
see you're here there's not much angle

486
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
see you're here there's not much angle
 

487
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,870
see you're here there's not much angle
cancellation to him in the first place

488
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
cancellation to him in the first place
 

489
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,110
cancellation to him in the first place
so you he could probably punch me boom

490
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,120
so you he could probably punch me boom
 

491
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,550
so you he could probably punch me boom
okay but if you were to get where I

492
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,560
okay but if you were to get where I
 

493
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,269
okay but if you were to get where I
can't get on the other side I have to be

494
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
can't get on the other side I have to be
 

495
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,509
can't get on the other side I have to be
on the back of the hand you can see how

496
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
on the back of the hand you can see how
 

497
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,629
on the back of the hand you can see how
much more angle cancellation there is so

498
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:25,639
much more angle cancellation there is so
 

499
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,990
much more angle cancellation there is so
he tries to punch it's a lot harder to

500
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
he tries to punch it's a lot harder to
 

501
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,990
he tries to punch it's a lot harder to
do

502
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
do
 

503
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,790
do
okay so for those reasons make sure you

504
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
okay so for those reasons make sure you
 

505
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,110
okay so for those reasons make sure you
get a good angle

506
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
get a good angle
 

507
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,670
get a good angle
cancellation you're coming around and

508
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
