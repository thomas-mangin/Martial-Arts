I'm Christopher Hine and today we are

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:09,850
I'm Christopher Hine and today we are
 

7
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,570
I'm Christopher Hine and today we are
talking about the forms in Aikido

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:12,580
talking about the forms in Aikido
 

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,000
talking about the forms in Aikido
so I cuneiforms tend to be an obsession

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,010
so I cuneiforms tend to be an obsession
 

11
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,970
so I cuneiforms tend to be an obsession
point for most Aikido students and the

12
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:17,980
point for most Aikido students and the
 

13
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,400
point for most Aikido students and the
techniques inside the forms tend to be a

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,410
techniques inside the forms tend to be a
 

15
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,349
techniques inside the forms tend to be a
little less important and the overall

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359
little less important and the overall
 

17
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,599
little less important and the overall
tactics and strategies of Aikido tend to

18
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:24,609
tactics and strategies of Aikido tend to
 

19
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,669
tactics and strategies of Aikido tend to
be even less important and so that's why

20
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:26,679
be even less important and so that's why
 

21
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,349
be even less important and so that's why
we have so much confusion in our system

22
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:28,359
we have so much confusion in our system
 

23
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,839
we have so much confusion in our system
in my approach to Aikido we kind of look

24
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:30,849
in my approach to Aikido we kind of look
 

25
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:32,310
in my approach to Aikido we kind of look
at it from the other way around which is

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
at it from the other way around which is
 

27
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,770
at it from the other way around which is
the strategy of I here the philosophy

28
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:34,780
the strategy of I here the philosophy
 

29
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,210
the strategy of I here the philosophy
and strategy is the first thing we look

30
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,220
and strategy is the first thing we look
 

31
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,610
and strategy is the first thing we look
at then we look at the tactics of Aikido

32
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:38,620
at then we look at the tactics of Aikido
 

33
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,040
at then we look at the tactics of Aikido
then we look at the techniques and then

34
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,050
then we look at the techniques and then
 

35
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,020
then we look at the techniques and then
we look at the forms last right so the

36
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,030
we look at the forms last right so the
 

37
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,330
we look at the forms last right so the
forms really are not that important

38
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:45,340
forms really are not that important
 

39
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,220
forms really are not that important
other than a way to collect and remember

40
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,230
other than a way to collect and remember
 

41
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,990
other than a way to collect and remember
all the techniques and the strategies

42
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,000
all the techniques and the strategies
 

43
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,970
all the techniques and the strategies
and the and the tactics of Aikido so

44
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:50,980
and the and the tactics of Aikido so
 

45
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,740
and the and the tactics of Aikido so
it's kind of more of a placeholder than

46
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:52,750
it's kind of more of a placeholder than
 

47
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,479
it's kind of more of a placeholder than
actually what's important so when people

48
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:54,489
actually what's important so when people
 

49
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,639
actually what's important so when people
think that the forms are the techniques

50
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:56,649
think that the forms are the techniques
 

51
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,290
think that the forms are the techniques
instead of just a collection of

52
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,300
instead of just a collection of
 

53
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,329
instead of just a collection of
techniques they think that IQ techniques

54
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:00,339
techniques they think that IQ techniques
 

55
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,189
techniques they think that IQ techniques
always have to end the way the forms end

56
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:02,199
always have to end the way the forms end
 

57
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,140
always have to end the way the forms end
and that means it has to end in a pin or

58
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,150
and that means it has to end in a pin or
 

59
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,970
and that means it has to end in a pin or
it has to end in a throw and that's

60
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:05,980
it has to end in a throw and that's
 

61
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,740
it has to end in a throw and that's
what's important is it ending in a pin

62
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:07,750
what's important is it ending in a pin
 

63
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,719
what's important is it ending in a pin
or it ending in a throw that's not at

64
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:09,729
or it ending in a throw that's not at
 

65
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,249
or it ending in a throw that's not at
all what's important generally what's

66
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:11,259
all what's important generally what's
 

67
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,600
all what's important generally what's
going to be important in Aikido is that

68
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:12,610
going to be important in Aikido is that
 

69
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,730
going to be important in Aikido is that
we can get to distance and make a safe

70
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:14,740
we can get to distance and make a safe
 

71
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,319
we can get to distance and make a safe
accord with someone right meaning the

72
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:16,329
accord with someone right meaning the
 

73
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,030
accord with someone right meaning the
real goal of Aikido is go hey hey let's

74
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,040
real goal of Aikido is go hey hey let's
 

75
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,380
real goal of Aikido is go hey hey let's
not have a struggle and then we don't

76
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,390
not have a struggle and then we don't
 

77
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,389
not have a struggle and then we don't
have a struggle that's ideally what I

78
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:21,399
have a struggle that's ideally what I
 

79
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,280
have a struggle that's ideally what I
want to do however when we get into

80
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,290
want to do however when we get into
 

81
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,870
want to do however when we get into
looking at the forms or looking at a

82
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
looking at the forms or looking at a
 

83
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,700
looking at the forms or looking at a
situation that keeps having problems

84
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:26,710
situation that keeps having problems
 

85
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,810
situation that keeps having problems
keeps having problems keeps having

86
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:27,820
keeps having problems keeps having
 

87
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,760
keeps having problems keeps having
problems now at the end of that is

88
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,770
problems now at the end of that is
 

89
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,069
problems now at the end of that is
actually our lowest percentage chance of

90
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
actually our lowest percentage chance of
 

91
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,139
actually our lowest percentage chance of
success so the end of the form is

92
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:34,149
success so the end of the form is
 

93
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,910
success so the end of the form is
actually the thing we want to do least

94
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
actually the thing we want to do least
 

95
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,830
actually the thing we want to do least
but most Aikido people and think that's

96
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
but most Aikido people and think that's
 

97
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
but most Aikido people and think that's
the thing we want to do most so today

98
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:39,850
the thing we want to do most so today
 

99
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,010
the thing we want to do most so today
we're gonna talk about the form of

100
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,020
we're gonna talk about the form of
 

101
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,859
we're gonna talk about the form of
yokomenuchi EDMA nage and how that

102
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:43,869
yokomenuchi EDMA nage and how that
 

103
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,300
yokomenuchi EDMA nage and how that
happens I'm gonna get Josh we're gonna

104
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,310
happens I'm gonna get Josh we're gonna
 

105
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,499
happens I'm gonna get Josh we're gonna
go to work Josh all right so we're gonna

106
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:49,509
go to work Josh all right so we're gonna
 

107
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,620
go to work Josh all right so we're gonna
talk about yokomenuchi eating me not

108
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,630
talk about yokomenuchi eating me not
 

109
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,990
talk about yokomenuchi eating me not
good and we're looking at that form and

110
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,000
good and we're looking at that form and
 

111
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,850
good and we're looking at that form and
under explaining all the little

112
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:56,860
under explaining all the little
 

113
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,410
under explaining all the little
techniques that are inside of the form

114
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,420
techniques that are inside of the form
 

115
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,149
techniques that are inside of the form
so a lot of times when people talk about

116
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
so a lot of times when people talk about
 

117
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
so a lot of times when people talk about
Aikido techniques and they're actually

118
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:01,930
Aikido techniques and they're actually
 

119
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,380
Aikido techniques and they're actually
talking about a form they say oh that

120
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,390
talking about a form they say oh that
 

121
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,410
talking about a form they say oh that
technique is very unlikely to happen but

122
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,420
technique is very unlikely to happen but
 

123
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,450
technique is very unlikely to happen but
the truth is the Aikido forms are built

124
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:09,460
the truth is the Aikido forms are built
 

125
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,859
the truth is the Aikido forms are built
of the same kind of techniques that

126
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:10,869
of the same kind of techniques that
 

127
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,440
of the same kind of techniques that
pretty much any other martial art would

128
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,450
pretty much any other martial art would
 

129
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,780
pretty much any other martial art would
use in that same context right so you

130
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:15,790
use in that same context right so you
 

131
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,559
use in that same context right so you
will see this

132
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:16,569
will see this
 

133
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,539
will see this
techniques that have appear in Filipino

134
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:18,549
techniques that have appear in Filipino
 

135
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,160
techniques that have appear in Filipino
martial arts the same techniques that

136
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,170
martial arts the same techniques that
 

137
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,649
martial arts the same techniques that
appear in Western European martial art

138
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:22,659
appear in Western European martial art
 

139
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,030
appear in Western European martial art
sites so all crime where arts that are

140
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040
sites so all crime where arts that are
 

141
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,380
sites so all crime where arts that are
dealing with the same kind of context

142
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,390
dealing with the same kind of context
 

143
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,030
dealing with the same kind of context
which is basically some kind of weapon

144
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
which is basically some kind of weapon
 

145
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,830
which is basically some kind of weapon
context you will see the exact same

146
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840
context you will see the exact same
 

147
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,199
context you will see the exact same
techniques Aikido puts them in forms so

148
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,209
techniques Aikido puts them in forms so
 

149
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,970
techniques Aikido puts them in forms so
they're easier to learn easier to

150
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:32,980
they're easier to learn easier to
 

151
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,679
they're easier to learn easier to
memorize and teach you a set of

152
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:34,689
memorize and teach you a set of
 

153
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,259
memorize and teach you a set of
strategic goals but you've got to

154
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,269
strategic goals but you've got to
 

155
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:38,910
strategic goals but you've got to
understand that that form is not what

156
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920
understand that that form is not what
 

157
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,199
understand that that form is not what
you're actually going to do most the

158
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,209
you're actually going to do most the
 

159
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,849
you're actually going to do most the
time but you are gonna use all the

160
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:41,859
time but you are gonna use all the
 

161
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,860
time but you are gonna use all the
little techniques in this right so we're

162
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,870
little techniques in this right so we're
 

163
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,099
little techniques in this right so we're

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,099
little a little out of the context of
this video but just to understand why

180
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,109
this video but just to understand why
 

181
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:03,569
this video but just to understand why
this might happen because that looks

182
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:03,579
this might happen because that looks
 

183
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,270
this might happen because that looks
silly yeah I had something anything in

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
pan doesn't matter what I have in my
 

189
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,869
pan doesn't matter what I have in my

190
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
hand if I want to smash this guy in the
 

191
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,789
hand if I want to smash this guy in the
head in my hands over here I'm probably

192
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:14,799
head in my hands over here I'm probably
 

193
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,339
head in my hands over here I'm probably
gonna swing it like this right so if

194
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:17,349
gonna swing it like this right so if
 

195
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,479
gonna swing it like this right so if
there's a knife I'm gonna swing it like

196
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:18,489
there's a knife I'm gonna swing it like
 

197
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,399

that if I want to cut with the knife I'd

198
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:20,409
that if I want to cut with the knife I'd
 

199
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,710
that if I want to cut with the knife I'd
probably cut like this if I had a frying

200
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
probably cut like this if I had a frying
 

201
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,089
probably cut like this if I had a frying
pan right we're in the kitchen and I'm

207
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,369
way I'm gonna smash this guy with it
right so that's what this big shot is

208
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:29,379
right so that's what this big shot is
 

209
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,879
right so that's what this big shot is
all about okay so I'm facing that

210
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:32,889
all about okay so I'm facing that
 

211

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,370
right I only really have a few options
 

219
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,920
right I only really have a few options
now with the yokomenuchi because it

220
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:43,930
now with the yokomenuchi because it
 

221
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,439
now with the yokomenuchi because it
comes from one side and exits on the

222
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:46,449
comes from one side and exits on the
 

223
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,110
comes from one side and exits on the
other side moving just this way isn't

224
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
other side moving just this way isn't
 

225
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,270
other side moving just this way isn't
really gonna help me right so if I were

226
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
really gonna help me right so if I were
 

227
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,860
really gonna help me right so if I were
just to move this direction when he

228
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:52,870
just to move this direction when he
 

229
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,539
just to move this direction when he
swings that he's probably gonna hit me

230
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:54,549
swings that he's probably gonna hit me
 

231
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:55,800
swings that he's probably gonna hit me
here if I were just to move this

232
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:55,810
here if I were just to move this
 

233
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,569
here if I were just to move this
direction eventually he's probably gonna

234
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:57,579
direction eventually he's probably gonna
 

235
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,879
direction eventually he's probably gonna
hit me there so what I want to do is I

236
00:03:59,879 --> 00:03:59,889
hit me there so what I want to do is I
 

237
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,710
hit me there so what I want to do is I
have to add a little bit of forward back

238
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:01,720
have to add a little bit of forward back
 

239
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,929
have to add a little bit of forward back
action right so if I wanted to move that

240
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:03,939
action right so if I wanted to move that
 

241
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,729
action right so if I wanted to move that
angle say when I did it I have to move

242
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:05,739
angle say when I did it I have to move
 

243
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,009
angle say when I did it I have to move
back when I do it right or if I want to

244
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:08,019
back when I do it right or if I want to
 

245
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,569
back when I do it right or if I want to
do this same thing or I could move

246
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:09,579
do this same thing or I could move
 

247
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,460
do this same thing or I could move
forward into it right so as he comes in

248
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,470
forward into it right so as he comes in
 

249
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,050
forward into it right so as he comes in
I can move forward right so this

250
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,060
I can move forward right so this
 

251
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,640
I can move forward right so this
position also will kind of help get me

252
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,650
position also will kind of help get me
 

253
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,589
position also will kind of help get me
out of that that that attacked his own

254
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:16,599
out of that that that attacked his own
 

255
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,779
out of that that that attacked his own
for him all right now what do I want to

256
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:18,789
for him all right now what do I want to
 

257
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,580
for him all right now what do I want to
do when I move well I don't want to just

258
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,590
do when I move well I don't want to just
 

259
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,089
do when I move well I don't want to just
stand there right I'm going to hit this

260
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:24,099
stand there right I'm going to hit this
 

261
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,010
stand there right I'm going to hit this
guy because hopefully that will end the

262
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,020
guy because hopefully that will end the
 

263
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,839
guy because hopefully that will end the
exchange so how do I do it I do it like

264
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:27,849
exchange so how do I do it I do it like
 

265
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,850
exchange so how do I do it I do it like
this bang

266
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:29,860
this bang
 

267
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,580
this bang
okay so this is already our second

268
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:32,590
okay so this is already our second
 

269
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,500
okay so this is already our second
technique our first technique is to

270
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,510
technique our first technique is to
 

271
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,940
technique our first technique is to
understand that a yokomen can be thrown

272
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:35,950
understand that a yokomen can be thrown
 

273
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,500
understand that a yokomen can be thrown
so that's the first technique in the

274
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,510
so that's the first technique in the
 

275
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,930
so that's the first technique in the
form second technique is one of the

276
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:39,940
form second technique is one of the
 

277
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,850
form second technique is one of the
options for this is to enter in and

278
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:41,860
options for this is to enter in and
 

279
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,840
options for this is to enter in and
smash this guy bang now what's really

280
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:45,850
smash this guy bang now what's really

nice about the way I'm hitting him is
 

283
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,250
nice about the way I'm hitting him is
notice the angle I'm taking so if I were

284
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,260
notice the angle I'm taking so if I were

289
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,760
strongest jaw she is right now like this
is this way and this way the weakest he

290
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,770
is this way and this way the weakest he
 

291
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,010
is this way and this way the weakest he
is is right at this angle right so when

now so when that distance is created I'm

352
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:51,700
now so when that distance is created I'm
 

353
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,550
now so when that distance is created I'm
either getting to my weapon platform or

354
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,560
either getting to my weapon platform or
 

355
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,710
either getting to my weapon platform or
I'm getting out those are my two options

356
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm getting out those are my two options
 

357
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,790
I'm getting out those are my two options
now that would be great if that

now that would be great if that
 

359
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
now that would be great if that
technique works successfully it would be

360
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,570
technique works successfully it would be
 

361
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,930
technique works successfully it would be
absolutely awesome what if it doesn't

362
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:00,940
absolutely awesome what if it doesn't
 

363

hard as I could I have zero effect if
 

377
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,360
hard as I could I have zero effect if
this hand is unaccounted for it will

378
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,370
this hand is unaccounted for it will
 

379
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,040
this hand is unaccounted for it will
continue to come in and get me so I hit

380

be escaping this way that gives me the
 

505
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,390
be escaping this way that gives me the
longest time to make my escape now what

506
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
longest time to make my escape now what
 

507

get couldn't could come off but that's
 

547
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,720
get couldn't could come off but that's
just one of the examples now when you

548
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,730
just one of the examples now when you
 

549
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,160
just one of the examples now when you
look at that form

550
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,170
look at that form
 

551
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,379
look at that form
you think the objective of the form is

552
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:00,389
you think the objective of the form is
 

553
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,689
you think the objective of the form is
to get the EDM Onaga so in your brain

554
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:02,699
to get the EDM Onaga so in your brain
 

555
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,249
to get the EDM Onaga so in your brain
you're like the objective of this like

556
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:04,259
you're like the objective of this like
 

557
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,480
you're like the objective of this like
your technique is to make eating me

558
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,490
your technique is to make eating me
 

559
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,030
your technique is to make eating me
noggin in fact the oedema nugget was the

560
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,040
noggin in fact the oedema nugget was the
 

561
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,160
noggin in fact the oedema nugget was the
worst thing that could have happened in

that form that's the last thing I want

564
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:12,269
that form that's the last thing I want
 

565
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,119
that form that's the last thing I want
to do because all the other things I

right I would rather have hit him with
the yokomen before he'd hit me with the

yokomen I would rather have stopped him
when he threw the yokomen I would rather

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,290
when he threw the yokomen I would rather
 

577
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,900
when he threw the yokomen I would rather
have passed it and got to a successful

578
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:23,910
have passed it and got to a successful
 

579
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,540
have passed it and got to a successful
weapon platform or to made an escape but

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:26,550
weapon platform or to made an escape but
 

581
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,769
weapon platform or to made an escape but
none of those things happen because this

582
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:27,779
none of those things happen because this
 

583
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,629

guy's on it on it on it so when we get

584
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:29,639
guy's on it on it on it so when we get
 

585
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,309
guy's on it on it on it so when we get
to the end of the form that's the last

586
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:31,319
to the end of the form that's the last
 

587
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,199
to the end of the form that's the last
thing I have to do it's also the lowest

588
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:33,209
thing I have to do it's also the lowest
 

589
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,449
thing I have to do it's also the lowest
percentage thing I could do so when I

590
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:35,459
percentage thing I could do so when I
 

591
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:36,860
percentage thing I could do so when I
feel people are thinking about what

592
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:36,870
feel people are thinking about what
 

593
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,269
feel people are thinking about what
they're going to do in Aikido they're

they're going to do in Aikido they're
 

595
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,530
they're going to do in Aikido they're
generally thinking about doing the

596
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,540
generally thinking about doing the
 

597
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,900
generally thinking about doing the
lowest percentage thing possible the

598
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:41,910
lowest percentage thing possible the
 

599
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,759
lowest percentage thing possible the
highest percentage thing possible is to

600
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:43,769
highest percentage thing possible is to
 

601
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,769
highest percentage thing possible is to
stay at distance and keep that guy from

602
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:45,779
stay at distance and keep that guy from
 

603
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,150
stay at distance and keep that guy from
ever attacking you which is the main

604
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
ever attacking you which is the main
 

605
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,040
ever attacking you which is the main
idea of Aikido but we've made all these

606
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,050
idea of Aikido but we've made all these
 

607
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,629
idea of Aikido but we've made all these
failures in the end we have to have some

608
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:50,639
failures in the end we have to have some
 

609
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,759
failures in the end we have to have some
technique to help us the technique is

610
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:52,769
technique to help us the technique is
 

611
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,249
technique to help us the technique is
not the form though and the form is not

612
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:55,259
not the form though and the form is not
 

613

614
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:56,670
the technique to two different entities
 

615
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,730

all right so this is the technical

all right so this is the technical

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,160
all right so this is the technical
