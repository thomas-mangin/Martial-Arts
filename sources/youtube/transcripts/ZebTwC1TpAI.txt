don't forget there's equations okay so
like if you want to push straight by
you're going to need a lot more you can
always take
off got it so play with it a little more
that way okay don't let
yourself start to tense up you can take
off whatever
yes okay that is the TR
yes
that's
turn
so as you go you have this hand right
you feel that keep the other hand
going two
together you do that or you can cut this
one closer
see you cut this closer and that one
have more you see that so you tend to
let it go dead once you do that you stop
and then this hand you you do that hand
okay yes
that's so that one both hands to
okay see how much you
okay
without that was your
one more
so why that one was good is you're not
forcing
that you find where it can come in
without you doing
that here see close it you see that but
it's light light
boom not
nice
nice see how it feels like nothing but
look where I'm going okay should feel
like nothing
[Music]
so see by not trying not to be strong
you're strong now okay you'll always
want to stay here and go that way
don't yes
that was
good good yeah that's the
[Music]
voice much right so let's say you start
on you come here and you feel the
weight you see that you can always move
it you see so you'll feel the
the pressure to much look at mov okay so
it would be
seamless
see yes
feel like
I'm this way you're bringing it that
don't judge it there's no there's no
right there's no right okay there's no
right there's just a
feeling careful cuz that judging mind is
the same pushing mind feel the
feel the
nothingness you get it and again you
just feel the
nothingness don't judge

bored right there's no there's no rest
it's just this moment yes
doesn't matter

you try I
don't want to do no different yes
yes if they gra they get it as
money one more
get of the both
seem attached to the
up so let's look at the up you kind of
go like
up but I'm more when I
touch it it itself I aim past your foot
you see that's what gives you the sense
of up it's not me
going so even on this one I'm not going
up I just go past the
foot if you lose your balance you you're
making up you see
that use it it don't let
it so you see it's not up just past your
basic support

this just
here

trust it trust it don't
it yes yes yes yes yes keep
them yes yep you don't it doesn't have
to go down so far
back so what you're feeling you feel
pressure there but you think it's from
not and it's from keep
going when you catch up to it like go
that way say I got off so when you catch
up to it I move it this way
see just turn take it 90Â° to what it's
doing so not here I know it feels like
that but it's not that it's going this
way that
way I keep l
go this way no just take it yes that's
all you need to go don't
hook yes protect
pass yes yes yes yes
don't don't pick it's all right there
find
it yes
you you can't mess up it's not possible
till the discriminating
mind okay
and as you move take sh see
shift same move

arms release more and accept
more yes

going to weight's going to shift you
see I turn the T and when I shift
T turn the T down
which makes it more wrong to go up
okay this what I want you to do for this
show is keep your hands in relation to
each other not opposite which happens
when we don't do the inward out spirals
they will go opposite but you do you do
an outward spiral on an inward spiral
you see my hands
you go one two you're doing this they go
opposite and they
lose the two hands on the on the field
okay keep them in a
relationship yes
yes trust it don't don't try to figure
it out just keep your hands your l b
facing each other in the
circles back in your CLA shift your
weight mind rotating with your hands
yes and don't forget at the
end the end is like the the EO pin
