00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,389

hi I'm Christopher Hine today we're

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:02,399
hi I'm Christopher Hine today we're
 

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,789
hi I'm Christopher Hine today we're
going to talk about my seventh form so

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
going to talk about my seventh form so
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,110
going to talk about my seventh form so
the seventh form that I do which is

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
the seventh form that I do which is
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,190
the seventh form that I do which is
analogous to cyto sensei's fifth form so

8
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,200
analogous to cyto sensei's fifth form so
 

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,390
analogous to cyto sensei's fifth form so
very similar to his fifth form um I put

10
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
very similar to his fifth form um I put
 

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,629
very similar to his fifth form um I put
six and seven together because they have

12
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:15,639
six and seven together because they have
 

13
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,470
six and seven together because they have
the same intro and that's also true for

14
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:17,480
the same intro and that's also true for
 

15
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,950
the same intro and that's also true for
cyto senses they have the same beginning

16
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:19,960
cyto senses they have the same beginning
 

17
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,670
cyto senses they have the same beginning
piece um and so when I do it you see two

18
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,680
piece um and so when I do it you see two
 

19
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,109
piece um and so when I do it you see two
different answers that could happen from

20
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,119
different answers that could happen from
 

21
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,189
different answers that could happen from
that same situation uh so I'm G get Josh

22
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:26,199
that same situation uh so I'm G get Josh
 

23
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,950
that same situation uh so I'm G get Josh
over here we're going to go work

24
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
over here we're going to go work
 

25
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,310
over here we're going to go work
Josh

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320

 

27
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,590

all right so let's talk about my seventh

28
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,600
all right so let's talk about my seventh
 

29
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,310
all right so let's talk about my seventh
form um which is analogous to cyto

30
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
form um which is analogous to cyto
 

31
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,190
form um which is analogous to cyto
sensei's fifth form uh I'm going to show

32
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200
sensei's fifth form uh I'm going to show
 

33
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,150
sensei's fifth form uh I'm going to show
you the way that I learned this form and

34
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
you the way that I learned this form and
 

35
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,110
you the way that I learned this form and
then I'm going to show you the slight

36
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
then I'm going to show you the slight
 

37
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,150
then I'm going to show you the slight
changes that I think maybe should happen

38
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
changes that I think maybe should happen
 

39
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,510
changes that I think maybe should happen
although I still mostly Do It um this

40
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
although I still mostly Do It um this
 

41
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,110
although I still mostly Do It um this
way I'm going to show you right now okay

42
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,120
way I'm going to show you right now okay
 

43
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,869
way I'm going to show you right now okay
so I teach it with the exact same

44
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
so I teach it with the exact same
 

45
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,830
so I teach it with the exact same
beginning as the previous form so my

46
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
beginning as the previous form so my
 

47
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,229
beginning as the previous form so my
seventh form my sixth form have the

48
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
seventh form my sixth form have the
 

49
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,950
seventh form my sixth form have the
exact identical beginning also Al so do

50
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
exact identical beginning also Al so do
 

51
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,630
exact identical beginning also Al so do
cyto sensei's second form and his fifth

52
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:03,640
cyto sensei's second form and his fifth
 

53
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,670
cyto sensei's second form and his fifth
form right so and that basic idea is

54
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
form right so and that basic idea is
 

55
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
form right so and that basic idea is
this that I'm in a panic State boom and

56
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
this that I'm in a panic State boom and
 

57
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,469
this that I'm in a panic State boom and
I pop this to the side and then I

58
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
I pop this to the side and then I
 

59
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,270
I pop this to the side and then I
immediately thrust back in at Josh now

60
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,280
immediately thrust back in at Josh now
 

61
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,789
immediately thrust back in at Josh now
the way he dealt with it in the last

62
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
the way he dealt with it in the last
 

63
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,950
the way he dealt with it in the last
form was to um go by me with like an UK

64
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
form was to um go by me with like an UK
 

65
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,030
form was to um go by me with like an UK
Nash style action here boom he slides in

66
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
Nash style action here boom he slides in
 

67
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,990
Nash style action here boom he slides in
and then we're in the close- range

68
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
and then we're in the close- range
 

69
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,030
and then we're in the close- range
position he goes for the lake right

70
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,040
position he goes for the lake right
 

71
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,630
position he goes for the lake right
another way that you could interpret

72
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:25,640
another way that you could interpret
 

73
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,630
another way that you could interpret
this form that isn't this way also is

74
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
this form that isn't this way also is
 

75
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,510
this form that isn't this way also is
just like first form right so when we do

76
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,520
just like first form right so when we do
 

77
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,069
just like first form right so when we do
this he could just back up and juch back

78
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:33,079
this he could just back up and juch back
 

79
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,550
this he could just back up and juch back
uh yeah that's this form yeah there we

80
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
uh yeah that's this form yeah there we
 

81
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,350
uh yeah that's this form yeah there we
go boom so he can just jod and guch back

82
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,360
go boom so he can just jod and guch back
 

83
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,590
go boom so he can just jod and guch back
right so this is just like first form so

84
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,600
right so this is just like first form so
 

85
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,389
right so this is just like first form so
I'm here and I fire for him and he gets

86
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:40,399
I'm here and I fire for him and he gets
 

87
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,389
I'm here and I fire for him and he gets
back okay now we already learned

88
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
back okay now we already learned
 

89
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,149
back okay now we already learned
basically all those lessons in first

90
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
basically all those lessons in first
 

91
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,149
basically all those lessons in first
form so we don't need to repeat that

92
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
form so we don't need to repeat that
 

93
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,990
form so we don't need to repeat that
here so are there any further ideas and

94
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,000
here so are there any further ideas and
 

95
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,990
here so are there any further ideas and
I believe yes this next one is a further

96
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000
I believe yes this next one is a further
 

97
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,389
I believe yes this next one is a further
idea he could just jump back in a

98
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399
idea he could just jump back in a
 

99
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,190
idea he could just jump back in a
relatively the same position right so

100
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
relatively the same position right so
 

101
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,230
relatively the same position right so
when I fire in he just jumps back right

102
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
when I fire in he just jumps back right
 

103
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,389
when I fire in he just jumps back right
so that's always he's looking for us

104
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
so that's always he's looking for us
 

105
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,950
so that's always he's looking for us
just to jump back out of the way he's

106
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:01,960
just to jump back out of the way he's
 

107
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,910
just to jump back out of the way he's
not trying to strike me or anything else

108
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
not trying to strike me or anything else
 

109
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,990
not trying to strike me or anything else
so we're not seeing that he's just

110
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
so we're not seeing that he's just
 

111
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,190
so we're not seeing that he's just
getting out of the way okay now from

112
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,200
getting out of the way okay now from
 

113
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,510
getting out of the way okay now from
this situation where he's out of the way

114
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,520
this situation where he's out of the way
 

115
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,470
this situation where he's out of the way
for another thrust right what would I do

116
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,480
for another thrust right what would I do
 

117
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,150
for another thrust right what would I do
well we learn in first form that I would

118
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,160
well we learn in first form that I would
 

119
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,110
well we learn in first form that I would
jodon to get him right so this is what

120
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
jodon to get him right so this is what
 

121
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,270
jodon to get him right so this is what
I'm going to do boom I'm G to track him

122
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm going to do boom I'm G to track him
 

123
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,430
I'm going to do boom I'm G to track him
down with the Jordan Huch so what he

124
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,440
down with the Jordan Huch so what he
 

125
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,070
down with the Jordan Huch so what he
does is he throws a katate gang so as we

126
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
does is he throws a katate gang so as we
 

127
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,630
does is he throws a katate gang so as we
come up here boom he's popping me with

128
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,640
come up here boom he's popping me with
 

129
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,509
come up here boom he's popping me with
the

130
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:26,519
the
 

131
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,430
the
katang however in the form I see it

132
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
katang however in the form I see it
 

133
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,229
katang however in the form I see it
before gets that far so he does that I

134
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:31,239
before gets that far so he does that I
 

135
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,750
before gets that far so he does that I
duck right underneath and I protect my

136
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
duck right underneath and I protect my
 

137
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,270
duck right underneath and I protect my
head coming here right and so the reason

138
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,280
head coming here right and so the reason
 

139
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,350
head coming here right and so the reason
I'm getting low is I'm defending

140
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm getting low is I'm defending
 

141
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm getting low is I'm defending
absolutely everything in one action

142
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
absolutely everything in one action
 

143
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,149
absolutely everything in one action
right so defending my legs my head and

144
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:40,159
right so defending my legs my head and
 

145
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,509
right so defending my legs my head and
everything in one action because I get

146
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
everything in one action because I get
 

147
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,030
everything in one action because I get
out of the way so even if he changed his

148
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
out of the way so even if he changed his
 

149
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,589
out of the way so even if he changed his
angle here to hit me boom I'm defended

150
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
angle here to hit me boom I'm defended
 

151
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,790
angle here to hit me boom I'm defended
against this right and that's all the

152
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
against this right and that's all the
 

153
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,190
against this right and that's all the
way down so I'm in a really good

154
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,200
way down so I'm in a really good
 

155
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,229
way down so I'm in a really good
position for everything okay where you

156
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
position for everything okay where you
 

157
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,149
position for everything okay where you
should be opening your hand is this one

158
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:52,159
should be opening your hand is this one
 

159
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,430
should be opening your hand is this one
because more likely he's going to try

160
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
because more likely he's going to try
 

161
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,350
because more likely he's going to try

and hit your head here in this less
likely he's going to try to hit this

164
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,440
likely he's going to try to hit this
 

165
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,589
likely he's going to try to hit this
hand however if I did see him go low I

166
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
hand however if I did see him go low I
 

167
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,990
hand however if I did see him go low I
could change that at a moment moment's

168
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
could change that at a moment moment's
 

169
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,470
could change that at a moment moment's

over like this and all I do is change it
 

179
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,070
over like this and all I do is change it
as I drop down to one knee okay now from

180
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
as I drop down to one knee okay now from
 

181
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,470
as I drop down to one knee okay now from
this he's going to let it swing through

182
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,480
this he's going to let it swing through
 

183
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,229
this he's going to let it swing through
just like a normal Kat get Gish and then

184
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,239
just like a normal Kat get Gish and then
 

185
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,750
just like a normal Kat get Gish and then
his idea is to smash me on top of the

186
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,760
his idea is to smash me on top of the
 

187
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,110
his idea is to smash me on top of the
head Bonk when he does that I bring my

188
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
head Bonk when he does that I bring my
 

189
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,789
head Bonk when he does that I bring my
hands over first like this and then I

190
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
hands over first like this and then I
 

191
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,550
hands over first like this and then I
try and make this glance off as much as

192
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:23,560
try and make this glance off as much as
 

193
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,509
try and make this glance off as much as
I can coming here and then boom I'm set

194
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
I can coming here and then boom I'm set
 

195
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,149
I can coming here and then boom I'm set
up for a really nice thrust there okay

196
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
up for a really nice thrust there okay
 

197
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,990
up for a really nice thrust there okay
so so basically the way I learned this

198
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
so so basically the way I learned this
 

199
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,429
so so basically the way I learned this
and let's switch roll go here real quick

200
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:30,439
and let's switch roll go here real quick
 

201
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,830
and let's switch roll go here real quick
for this right okay so I come in Josh

202
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
for this right okay so I come in Josh
 

203
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,550
for this right okay so I come in Josh
he's going to knock that away then he

204
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:35,560
he's going to knock that away then he
 

205
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,990
he's going to knock that away then he
thrusts in at me and the way I learned

206
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,000
thrusts in at me and the way I learned
 

207
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,309
thrusts in at me and the way I learned
it was to pull back like this and then

208
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319
it was to pull back like this and then
 

209
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,270
it was to pull back like this and then
as Josh comes in I swing through here

210
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,280
as Josh comes in I swing through here
 

211
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,429
as Josh comes in I swing through here
like this to him and then I come down to

212
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:44,439
like this to him and then I come down to
 

213
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,990
like this to him and then I come down to
smash him he pushes that to the side and

214
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
smash him he pushes that to the side and
 

215
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,070
smash him he pushes that to the side and
then he thrusts me here okay I think

216
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,080
then he thrusts me here okay I think
 

217
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,190
then he thrusts me here okay I think
it's good to understand what's happening

218
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
it's good to understand what's happening
 

219
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,789
it's good to understand what's happening
in that moment of the katate Gish so in

220
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
in that moment of the katate Gish so in
 

221
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,190
in that moment of the katate Gish so in
cyto sensei's work when we see kenish

222
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
cyto sensei's work when we see kenish
 

223
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,630
cyto sensei's work when we see kenish
we're always seeing it from this

224
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
we're always seeing it from this
 

225
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,630
we're always seeing it from this
position I think this is really easy way

226
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
position I think this is really easy way
 

227
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,550
position I think this is really easy way
to teach new people how to do this so

228
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
to teach new people how to do this so
 

229
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,789
to teach new people how to do this so
they get less confused however what you

230
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
they get less confused however what you
 

231
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,830
they get less confused however what you
really should understand is that that

232
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:06,840
really should understand is that that
 

233
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,350
really should understand is that that
action is in subet right so the way that

234
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,360
action is in subet right so the way that
 

235
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,910
action is in subet right so the way that
I teach my partner forms and we'll see

236
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
I teach my partner forms and we'll see
 

237
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,910
I teach my partner forms and we'll see
those eventually is that when we get

238
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
those eventually is that when we get
 

239
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,789
those eventually is that when we get
here this action is a sliding action

240
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
here this action is a sliding action
 

241
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,590
here this action is a sliding action
just a secondary sliding action and that

242
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
just a secondary sliding action and that
 

243
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,830
just a secondary sliding action and that
makes the action much more deceptive

244
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
makes the action much more deceptive
 

245
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,830
makes the action much more deceptive
right so meaning here in this when uh

246
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
right so meaning here in this when uh
 

247
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,790
right so meaning here in this when uh
actually I want to do the other rule

248
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
actually I want to do the other rule
 

249
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,590
actually I want to do the other rule
sorry when Josh comes in for me and I

250
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
sorry when Josh comes in for me and I
 

251
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,790

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
just hop back right like this I'm
 

253
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,629
just hop back right like this I'm
setting up a subet now what could happen

254
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
setting up a subet now what could happen
 

255
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,070
setting up a subet now what could happen
here is Josh could come with a jodon

256
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
here is Josh could come with a jodon
 

257
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,270
here is Josh could come with a jodon
guch and he could get me here if I tried

258
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,280
guch and he could get me here if I tried
 

259
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,029
guch and he could get me here if I tried
to subet him right but I'm going to make

260
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,039
to subet him right but I'm going to make
 

261
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,629
to subet him right but I'm going to make
way more link so if Josh goes it is

262
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
way more link so if Josh goes it is
 

263
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,350
way more link so if Josh goes it is
exactly the same link you can see here

264
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
exactly the same link you can see here
 

265
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,629
exactly the same link you can see here
I'm still going to clip and don't don't

266
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:43,639
I'm still going to clip and don't don't
 

267
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,830
I'm still going to clip and don't don't
outspeed me so you can see I'm going to

268
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
outspeed me so you can see I'm going to
 

269
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,550
outspeed me so you can see I'm going to
clip him so even though he pushed back

270
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
clip him so even though he pushed back
 

271
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,710
clip him so even though he pushed back
with this attack if he goes back I'll

272
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
with this attack if he goes back I'll
 

273
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,230
with this attack if he goes back I'll
still get him because I'm going

274
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
still get him because I'm going
 

275
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,950
still get him because I'm going
one-handed right so one-handed gives me

276
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:53,960
one-handed right so one-handed gives me
 

277
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,790
one-handed right so one-handed gives me
more length than two-handed will right

278
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:55,800
more length than two-handed will right
 

279
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,830
more length than two-handed will right
so so that's the advantage of using this

280
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
so so that's the advantage of using this
 

281
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,189
so so that's the advantage of using this
action even if he was going to pull back

282
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
action even if he was going to pull back
 

283
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,550
action even if he was going to pull back
from a ski he could still do that so if

284
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
from a ski he could still do that so if
 

285
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,510
from a ski he could still do that so if
we used first form answer for this right

286
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
we used first form answer for this right
 

287
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,590
we used first form answer for this right
so so in first form answer basically

288
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
so so in first form answer basically
 

289
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,350
so so in first form answer basically
sorry we gota be this real so first form

290
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
sorry we gota be this real so first form
 

291
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,870
sorry we gota be this real so first form
answer would be this I come in Josh pops

292
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,880
answer would be this I come in Josh pops
 

293
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,710
answer would be this I come in Josh pops
it to the side and I hop back and now

294
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:13,720
it to the side and I hop back and now
 

295
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,350
it to the side and I hop back and now
I'm expecting Josh to cover the distance

296
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm expecting Josh to cover the distance
 

297
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,749
I'm expecting Josh to cover the distance
with Jan g h and I have pop him here now

298
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
with Jan g h and I have pop him here now
 

299
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,670
with Jan g h and I have pop him here now
if Josh knows first form answers coming

300
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
if Josh knows first form answers coming
 

301
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,909
if Josh knows first form answers coming
he can scoop back slightly beyond that

302
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
he can scoop back slightly beyond that
 

303
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,430
he can scoop back slightly beyond that
okay but if he does the same thing with

304
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,440
okay but if he does the same thing with
 

305
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,430
okay but if he does the same thing with
this what's going to happen is this I'm

306
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,440
this what's going to happen is this I'm
 

307
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,189
this what's going to happen is this I'm
still going to tag him still going to

308
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
still going to tag him still going to
 

309
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,670
still going to tag him still going to
tag him so I get more reach so I'm

310
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,680
tag him so I get more reach so I'm
 

311
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,309
tag him so I get more reach so I'm
actually taking care of both situations

312
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,319
actually taking care of both situations
 

313
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,070
actually taking care of both situations
here where if I just went back to the

314
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,080
here where if I just went back to the
 

315
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,629
here where if I just went back to the

this oneand extension I can get even
 

335
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,230
this oneand extension I can get even
further than he can in kinami right so
