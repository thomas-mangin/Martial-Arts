1
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:54,137
You started Aikido at a very young age, could you tell us about it?

2
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,101
A lot of the other teachers say that they started Aikido

3
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,939
because they were moved by O Sensei’s words

4
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:15,450
or because it was a Budo of harmony,

5
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,828
but for me, it was different.

6
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,582
Frankly, I didn’t want to lose in street fight.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:29,756
I came here when I was in grade 7 at the age of 12.

8
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:41,059
I think it was June 1st, 1949.

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:46,732
What was the training routine like in the Iwama dojo?

10
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:51,153
Back then, there were no tatami in this dojo.

11
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,656
It was wooden flooring

12
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:59,703
so projections weren’t like today’s where you would be thrown on the floor

13
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:06,501
making ”bang, bang, bang, bang” sounds on the tatami as you took ukemi.

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,672
First of all, in O Sensei’s classes,

15
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:22,142
you would start gently from easy techniques and move on to more difficult ones,

16
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:33,153
so I started from suwariwaza and gradually moved to hanmi handachi, and then tachiwaza.

17
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,533
Guillaume started in the group of Andre Nocquet. Did Nocquet visit the Iwama dojo often when he was in Japan?

18
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:50,420
While I was here, I think that he came a few times, but not that often.

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:03:00,389
I trained with him a few times when I went to the Honbu Dojo with O Sensei.

20
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,974
When I was still in high school,

21
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,353
Mr Nocquet who was really well built,

22
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,732
but his nikyo didn’t work at all on  me,

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,070
while mine worked just fine, so he said that there was something wrong.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,366
He was trying hard though.

25
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:26,331
Then Kisshomaru Sensei came to tell him he wasn’t doing it right and he demonstrated it on me.

26
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,502
That’s my memory with him.

27
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:35,882
When you started, the techniques were called “kajo” instead of "kyo", did they bear more resemblance with that of Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu?

28
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,260
That's definitely true.

29
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,400
When I was taught by the founder, we would use the kajo system

30
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,920
and call it ikkajo, nikajo, sankajo, and so on.

31
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:52,149
But when Andre Nocquet came to from France to the Honbu Dojo as an uchi deshi,

32
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:58,155
we didn’t have such a thing as a manual,

33
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:06,348
so Kisshomaru Sensei published the first Aikido book, and in it,

34
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:11,960
and in it, he didn't use ikkajo, nikajo, etc. but ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, etc.

35
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:23,138
Actually, in koryu jujutsu, both of these systems coexist.

36
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,019
Kyo is written with the kanji “to teach”, but I didn’t know what it was at first,

37
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:35,157
I was wondering how it was supposed to be written,

38
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:41,957
and it's only when I read the book that I learned it.

39
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,246
So back then, kotegaeshi was the same,

40
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:54,503
but nikyo ura was called kote mawashi.

41
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,421
Now it's been changed.

42
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:01,885
Why were the names changed from "kajo" to "kyo"?

43
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:13,814
Well, I don’t know what Kisshomaru Sensei had in mind...

44
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:20,144
I think that it was probably because the kajo system was used in the Daito-ryu scrolls

45
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:25,904
that Takeda Sokaku Sensei used to award.

46
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:37,546
He probably wanted to move away or update things from that.

47
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,383
This is my just my guess though.

48
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:47,055
The 5 principles of Aikido are organized in a very similar way to that of Daito-ryu. Do you know why?

49
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:55,480
When I started back in 1949,

50
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:04,281
O Sensei's techniques where a bit different compared to those in his later years, even if they were both called ikkyo.

51
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:13,498
In Daito-ryu for example, what is called ikkajo is a set of several techniques, but that’s also true in aikido.

52
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:22,841
For example, we might simply call it ikkyo, but there’s a variety of techniques from shomen-uchi, yokomen-uchi, and katate-dori.

53
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,635
So there are different versions of ikkyo.

54
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:33,184
People used to say that there were more than 2000 techniques in the basic curriculum alone.

55
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,565
If the techniques called ikkyo to gokyo are also principles, does it imply that others such as kote gaeshi, hijikime osae, shiho nage, aren't?

56
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:50,911
Well, I think, whether or not it’s associated with the word kyo doesn’t determine the importance of a technique.

57
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:58,919
For example, the techniques from ikkyo to gokyo are all immobilization techniques,

58
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:05,634
and the techniques like kotegaeshi, shihonage, and iriminage are projections.

59
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:14,142
So the techniques under different names have different characteristics and you can’t simply categorize in terms in such a way:

60
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:25,445
"This technique is superficial and that one is essential"

61
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,825
It seems that the name "Aikido" was chosen by a committee wasn't it?

62
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,454
Well, I don’t know,

63
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:39,459
but it's been written in some books.

64
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:49,511
Apparently Hirai Sensei would go to Butokukai to teach on behalf of O Sensei,

65
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:55,433
because he was one of O Sensei’s students.

66
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:07,946
At the time, I’m not sure if it was called Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu,

67
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:14,160
but apparently it's at that time that they used the word Aikido for the first time.

68
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,912
I’m not sure about that.

69
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:22,836
When I came to join here, it was called Aikikai Foundation.

70
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,300
The Aikikai Foundation was approved by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in 1947.

71
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:36,433
Before that, it had been called Kobukai Foundation for a long time.

72
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:50,088
Then after the war, I think it was 1947, the Ministry approved the organization as Aikikai Foundation.

73
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:56,000
They were using the word Aiki back then.

74
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:06,254
And the title on my registration paper is "Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu registry".

75
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,410
This is what I signed.

76
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
At the top of the students' registry,

77
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,360
there are also the  names of people such as the Admiral Takeshita Isamu.

78
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,941
How was Ueshiba Sensei's art called before that?

79
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,738
Before it became Aikido, it used to be called "Aikibudo".

80
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,198
"Aikibudo"

81
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:41,331
As for us, when I started, we would always call it "Aiki" instead of "Aikibudo".

82
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,084
Not "Aikido".

83
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:58,264
I think it was before the war ended, probably before 1945, that it was called "Aikibudo".

84
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:03,645
You entered soon after O Sensei's move to Iwama, at a time when Aikido underwent a deep change...

85
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:19,744
Well, I think the end to the war brought some changes.

86
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:26,167
Different things… I didn’t really know because I was a child,

87
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:33,133
but when O Sensei came here, he wasn’t really well.

88
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,426
He was sick.

89
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:42,725
Until then, as you can see here, he had been wearing only a mustache,

90
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:48,106
but when he came here, he started growing his beard.

91
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:55,530
When I joined in 1949, his beard was already like this.

92
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:02,912
The shrine was built in 1943,

93
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:07,625
and before that, he would come here from time to time.

94
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:19,512
And then there was the end of war, as well as the Omoto incident.

95
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,310
O sensei was not affected though.

96
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:31,316
What was Kisshomaru Sensei's part in all those changes?

97
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,694
Well, for example,

98
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:39,974
I can’t really compare O Sensei with Kisshomaru Sensei,

99
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:51,502
but O Sensei wasn’t really interested in a setting up an organization.

100
00:11:51,502 --> 00:12:00,803
I think that’s understandable because the Founder created a path where there had been none.

101
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:09,437
But when the foundation was created to a certain level, Kisshomaru Sensei started focusing on making it into an organization.

102
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:16,611
I think that if the Second Doshu, Kisshomaru Sensei, had acted the same way as the Fouder,

103
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,091
there would be no Aikido as we know it today.

104
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,091
The Aikikai organization.

105
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:30,917
So that way, I think Kisshomaru Sensei made a huge contribution to the Aikido community.

106
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:38,549
So when they published the first book,

107
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:48,518
they tried not to use words like kyo or kajo, that people who knew nothing about Aikido would not understand.

108
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,607
They used simple words that everyone would understand.

109
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:01,614
What is the place of the Ibaraki Dojo in today's Aikido?

110
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,202
That’s a difficult question, extremely difficult to answer.

111
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:13,251
Now, Doshu comes gives classes once a week,

112
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,963
and Waka-Sensei also comes to teach on Wednesdays.

113
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:23,886
Doshu is supposed to come every week to teach the Saturday class, but he is busy.

114
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,432
I think he still does once or twice a month though.

115
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:36,274
So the Hombu Dojo and this Dojo are on the verge of becoming one,

116
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:43,406
but our practices are a bit different, and some people get confused.

117
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,577
That said, it's been going well so far,

118
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:58,379
and if our instructors and the instructors at the Hombu can exchange more,

119
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:08,765
understand each other's practice, and talk frankly,

120
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:15,146
this would go in the good direction
