111
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,970
hit me on the happy so when I come in
that's when he should his source should

112
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:10,980
that's when he should his source should
 

113
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,020
that's when he should his source should
be cutting off my my face okay so it's

be cutting off my my face okay so it's
 

115
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,470
be cutting off my my face okay so it's
not it's not going to be one two and

116
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:18,480
not it's not going to be one two and
 

117
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,980
not it's not going to be one two and
then no okay this is go slow but if you

118
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:24,990
then no okay this is go slow but if you
 

119
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,440
then no okay this is go slow but if you
want that timing okay and it's because

120
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,450
want that timing okay and it's because
 

121
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,870
want that timing okay and it's because
you're getting checked out you're

122
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
you're getting checked out you're
 

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,050
you're getting checked out you're
getting checked out because you're not

124
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,060
getting checked out because you're not
 

125
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,620
getting checked out because you're not
neutralizing via twisting the drop okay

126
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,630
neutralizing via twisting the drop okay
 

127
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,080
neutralizing via twisting the drop okay
so let's assume

128
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,090
so let's assume
 

129
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,750
so let's assume
that is doing that you're gonna go get

130
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:43,760
that is doing that you're gonna go get
 

131
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,450
that is doing that you're gonna go get
you're gonna feel yen that's what he was

132
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,460
you're gonna feel yen that's what he was
 

133
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,950
you're gonna feel yen that's what he was
using you're gonna feel a lot again okay

134
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:49,960
using you're gonna feel a lot again okay
 

135
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,670
using you're gonna feel a lot again okay
so you've been kind of think of it as

136
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
so you've been kind of think of it as
 

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,159
so you've been kind of think of it as
starting all over again the same way

138
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,169
starting all over again the same way
 

139
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,250
starting all over again the same way
that I have this say GaN where you go

140
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,260
that I have this say GaN where you go
 

141
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,230
that I have this say GaN where you go
bulls

142
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,240

hold pull this unit I'm gonna go back to
 

145
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,120
hold pull this unit I'm gonna go back to
that do you understand till I see his

146
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,130
that do you understand till I see his
 

147
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:18,100
that do you understand till I see his
hands play won't see and he went up so

148
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,110
hands play won't see and he went up so
 

149
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,600
hands play won't see and he went up so
I'm bringing my stay going up okay let's

150
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,610
I'm bringing my stay going up okay let's
 

151
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm bringing my stay going up okay let's
do it on the other side and that will

152
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:27,560
do it on the other side and that will
 

153
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,610
do it on the other side and that will
kind of almost happen naturally because

154
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:30,620
kind of almost happen naturally because
 

155
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,659
kind of almost happen naturally because
you were keeping contact with his weapon

156
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:34,669
you were keeping contact with his weapon
 

157
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,450
you were keeping contact with his weapon
as long as possible you see that and

158
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:39,460
as long as possible you see that and
 

159
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,010
as long as possible you see that and
then I'm going to attack the source

160
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,020
then I'm going to attack the source
 

161
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,680
then I'm going to attack the source
again that's that's what's right there

162
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,690
again that's that's what's right there
 

163
