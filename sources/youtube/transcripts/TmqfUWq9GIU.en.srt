29
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,490
is a great strike for in the clinch
because it allows you to keep your elbow

30
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:49,500
because it allows you to keep your elbow
 

31
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,330
because it allows you to keep your elbow
down

32
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,340
down
 

33
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,550
down
as opposed to the hook

34
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
as opposed to the hook
 

35
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,430
as opposed to the hook
is also a closed technique but your

36
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
is also a closed technique but your
 

37
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,749
is also a closed technique but your
elbows knocked down and just like a

38
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
elbows knocked down and just like a
 

39
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,450
elbows knocked down and just like a
elbow that is straight

40
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,460

does not happen from way out there

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,300
does not happen from way out there
 

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,870
does not happen from way out there
okay

56
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:23,880

 

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,390

so uh as he's doing the strike

58
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,400
so uh as he's doing the strike
 

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,249
so uh as he's doing the strike
um let's look at the yin and yang

60
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,259
um let's look at the yin and yang
 

61
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,010
um let's look at the yin and yang
aspects of the strike itself

62
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,020
aspects of the strike itself
 

63
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,150
aspects of the strike itself
so it's as it's coming up is its Yin

64
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
so it's as it's coming up is its Yin
 

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,730
so it's as it's coming up is its Yin
phase because it is going

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:40,740
phase because it is going
 

67
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,930
phase because it is going
up and towards him

68
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940

 

69
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,430

so that is where I first match with it

70
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
so that is where I first match with it
 

71
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,629
so that is where I first match with it
and see contact okay and then as it's

72
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:53,639
and see contact okay and then as it's
 

73
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,689
and see contact okay and then as it's
going down and forward

74
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:56,699
going down and forward
 

75
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,110
going down and forward
is when it has its young face which is

76
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,120
is when it has its young face which is
 

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,830
is when it has its young face which is
where I yield to it okay

78
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
where I yield to it okay
 

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,249
where I yield to it okay
so uh it's coming we'll just go put your

80
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:07,259
so uh it's coming we'll just go put your

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,249
other like we'll take the steps out just
so you can see that okay so as time goes

84
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:13,259
so you can see that okay so as time goes

so again just looking

122
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:04,259
so again just looking
 

123
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,150
so again just looking
he goes up I see connection I follow it

124
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
he goes up I see connection I follow it
 

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,110
he goes up I see connection I follow it
and then I let it yield

126
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120

 

127
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,870

uh

128
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:13,880
uh
 

129
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,730
uh
boom let it heal there's the other hand

130
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
boom let it heal there's the other hand
 

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,710
boom let it heal there's the other hand
elbow comes in

132
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
elbow comes in
 

133
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,110
elbow comes in
so it just says

134
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
so it just says
 

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,550
so it just says
this would be wrong

136
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560

 

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,529

that's wrong too

138
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:27,539
that's wrong too
 

139
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,290
that's wrong too
that'll never happen because the strike

140
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
that'll never happen because the strike
 

141
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,450
that'll never happen because the strike
already went by you and you're not gonna

142
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:32,460
already went by you and you're not gonna
 

143
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,689
already went by you and you're not gonna
catch that Quest okay

144
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:35,699
catch that Quest okay
 

145
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,309
catch that Quest okay
so again

146
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:37,319
so again
 

147
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,610
so again
as it lifts I lift and I yield to catch

148
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:43,620
as it lifts I lift and I yield to catch
 

149
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,409
as it lifts I lift and I yield to catch
one more time

150
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:45,419
one more time
 

151
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,110
one more time
lift

152
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
lift
 

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,129
lift
yield catch

154
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:55,139

 

155
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,909

your other hand is already guarding you

156
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:58,919
your other hand is already guarding you
 

157
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,909
your other hand is already guarding you
and so when I heal in other words I

158
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
and so when I heal in other words I
 

159
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,770
and so when I heal in other words I
don't want it down here when I do all

160
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:03,780
don't want it down here when I do all
 

161
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,290
don't want it down here when I do all
this and then think it's going to catch

162
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300
this and then think it's going to catch
 

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,870
this and then think it's going to catch
up

164
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:08,880

 

165
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,230

my other hand is going up you see it's

166
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
my other hand is going up you see it's
 

167
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,430
my other hand is going up you see it's
on the center line boom he touched me

168
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,440
on the center line boom he touched me
 

169
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,369
on the center line boom he touched me
and get your adhesion going and you're

170
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:19,379
and get your adhesion going and you're
 

171
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,510
and get your adhesion going and you're
in

172
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:20,520
in
 

173
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,869
in
so we'll look at this time

174
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:23,879
so we'll look at this time
 

175
