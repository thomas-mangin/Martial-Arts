165
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,990
I'm pushing in his whole back down so do
you see that difference okay so you

166
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
you see that difference okay so you
 

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,660
you see that difference okay so you
can't have the hand over here you got to

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:58,670
can't have the hand over here you got to
 

169
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,130

get it across his body
and you're aiming for that whole box

172
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,690
and you're aiming for that whole box
 

173
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,730
and you're aiming for that whole box
what's the actual link here not wait

174
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:06,740
what's the actual link here not wait
 

175
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,150
what's the actual link here not wait
here because he'll pivot around that

176
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,160
here because he'll pivot around that
 

177
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,470
here because he'll pivot around that
okay so we'll do it slow on the other

178
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:11,480
okay so we'll do it slow on the other
 

179
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,920
okay so we'll do it slow on the other
side and who can you know face for job

180
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,930
side and who can you know face for job
 

181
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,380
side and who can you know face for job
so again boom right to his face is where

182
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,390
so again boom right to his face is where
 

183
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,100
so again boom right to his face is where
that's going and already I'm thinking to

184
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,110
that's going and already I'm thinking to

shoulder where she can't reach me we see
 

205
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,820
shoulder where she can't reach me we see
how to do that okay and then look that's

206
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:06,830
how to do that okay and then look that's
 

207

I'm trying to get this other pin my

212
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm trying to get this other pin my
 

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,460
I'm trying to get this other pin my
weights going down on there right

214
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,470
weights going down on there right
 

215
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,159
weights going down on there right
Virginie so that's the best idea

218
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:23,229
okay so we'd like to be nice and I could
 

219
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:23,909
okay so we'd like to be nice and I could
do it over here

220
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919

225
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:45,090
onto that arm okay I'm doing all this I
get this pin you see that and like all

226
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,100
get this pin you see that and like all
 

227
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,120
get this pin you see that and like all
he has to do is shift there you go you

228
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,130
he has to do is shift there you go you
 

229
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,660
he has to do is shift there you go you
think to come back even if I make it

230
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,670
think to come back even if I make it
 

231
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,319
think to come back even if I make it
really tight ship yes

232

really tight ship yes
 

233
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:58,470
really tight ship yes
so yeah it's gonna be tight right so

234
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
so yeah it's gonna be tight right so
 

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,420
so yeah it's gonna be tight right so
we've just flipped over I have it when

236
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,430
we've just flipped over I have it when
 

237
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,710
we've just flipped over I have it when
he goes down you got to get that hand

and you end up on this side like that

260
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,120
and you end up on this side like that
 

261
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,690
and you end up on this side like that
okay so she comes to get that arm goes

262
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:49,700
okay so she comes to get that arm goes
 

263
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,000
okay so she comes to get that arm goes
to change the angle right would I don't

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,010
to change the angle right would I don't
 

265
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,199
to change the angle right would I don't
have a very good angle you see that and

266
