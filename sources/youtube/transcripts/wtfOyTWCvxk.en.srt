00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,829
let go
on you

363
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
on you
 

364
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,870
on you
you don't have the connection right now

365
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
you don't have the connection right now
 

366
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,750
you don't have the connection right now
you see that

367
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:20,760

 

368
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,170

but if if he's the one who lets go then

369
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:24,180
but if if he's the one who lets go then
 

370
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,210
but if if he's the one who lets go then
you would have the connection you go to

371
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
you would have the connection you go to
 

372
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,889
you would have the connection you go to
the next connection point he did that

373
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:27,899
the next connection point he did that
 

374
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,829
the next connection point he did that
you you get that I'm not trying to get

375
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:30,839
you you get that I'm not trying to get
 

376
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,689
you you get that I'm not trying to get
out of this grip

377
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:32,699
out of this grip
 

378
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,410
out of this grip
so likewise I keep the same connection

379
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:36,420
so likewise I keep the same connection
 

380
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,930
so likewise I keep the same connection
Point why would I why would I let go of

381
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:38,940
Point why would I why would I let go of
 

382
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,490
Point why would I why would I let go of
this connection point when I have a

383
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,500
this connection point when I have a
 

384
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,329
this connection point when I have a
center to get disarmed

385
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:44,339
center to get disarmed
 

386
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,689
center to get disarmed
I I have his body okay I have his body

387
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:47,699
I I have his body okay I have his body
 

388
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,509
I I have his body okay I have his body
moving his body around moving his body

389
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
moving his body around moving his body
 

390
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,790
moving his body around moving his body
through

391
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:55,800

 

392
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,769

feet holds on

393
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:57,779
feet holds on
 

394
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,230
feet holds on
and I keep the connections if you let go

and I keep the connections if you let go
 

396
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,389
and I keep the connections if you let go
I go to the next connection point but

397
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
I go to the next connection point but
 

398
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,030
I go to the next connection point but
I'll take my connection point away

399
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
I'll take my connection point away
 

400
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,519
I'll take my connection point away
okay
