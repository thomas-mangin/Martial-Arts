122
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
we're going to start right from this
 

123
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,230
we're going to start right from this
position

124
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
position
 

125
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,630
position
now you could call this the ikkyo pin if

126
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
now you could call this the ikkyo pin if
 

127
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,350
now you could call this the ikkyo pin if
you want

128
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
you want
 

129

you want
um or ikiose but that's only one

130
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
um or ikiose but that's only one
 

131
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,870
um or ikiose but that's only one
aspect of all the stuff that comes from

132
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
aspect of all the stuff that comes from
 

133
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,749
aspect of all the stuff that comes from
this series

134
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
this series
 

135
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,590
this series
alright now if you happen to have

136
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
alright now if you happen to have
 

137
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,950
alright now if you happen to have
someone in this position

138
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
someone in this position
 

139
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,030
someone in this position
and you want to make the takedown how

140
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
and you want to make the takedown how
 

141
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,469
and you want to make the takedown how
does the takedown go through

142
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
does the takedown go through
 

143
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,030
does the takedown go through
now you should start with this with the

144
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
now you should start with this with the
 

145
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,350
now you should start with this with the
lead leg being on the outside

146
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
lead leg being on the outside
 

147
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,510
lead leg being on the outside
and the near leg the leg that's near him

148
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
and the near leg the leg that's near him
 

149
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,110
and the near leg the leg that's near him
being on the inside and the reason for

150
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
being on the inside and the reason for
 

151
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,830
being on the inside and the reason for
that is

152
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
that is
 

153
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,830
that is
this makes it most difficult for him to

154
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
this makes it most difficult for him to
 

155
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,670
this makes it most difficult for him to
get a hold of my leg so if i had his arm

156
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
get a hold of my leg so if i had his arm
 

157
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,350
get a hold of my leg so if i had his arm
here decently if he goes to get my legs

158
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
here decently if he goes to get my legs
 

159
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,869
here decently if he goes to get my legs
you can see that leg's going to cost him

160
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
you can see that leg's going to cost him
 

161
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,990
you can see that leg's going to cost him
right he's going to fall down for

162
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
right he's going to fall down for
 

163
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,589
right he's going to fall down for
that leg if he reaches over for this

164
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
that leg if he reaches over for this
 

165
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,190
that leg if he reaches over for this
other leg it's real hard for him to get

166
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
other leg it's real hard for him to get
 

167
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,630
other leg it's real hard for him to get
and going to cost him okay

168
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
and going to cost him okay
 

169
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,470
and going to cost him okay
however if i have this leg forward he

170
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
however if i have this leg forward he
 

171
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,070
however if i have this leg forward he
really easily can sneak in and grab that

172
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
really easily can sneak in and grab that
 

173
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,910
really easily can sneak in and grab that
leg and that's going to give me trouble

174
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
leg and that's going to give me trouble
 

175
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,470
leg and that's going to give me trouble

so i need to in some way get him nudged
forward to do that now the second he

204
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
forward to do that now the second he
 

205
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,910
forward to do that now the second he
touches

206
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
touches
 

207
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,790

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
he needs three points to be balanced so
 

209
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,309

in this three point balance
 

211
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,910
in this three point balance
i can step forward because if you were

212
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
i can step forward because if you were
 

213
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,149
i can step forward because if you were
to grab my leg here he's got no balance

214
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
to grab my leg here he's got no balance
 

215
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,750

that's the time when you can safely step
in is once this hand touches

so i want the outside leg forward

260
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
so i want the outside leg forward

near leg is back until he touches once

262
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
near leg is back until he touches once
 

263
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,270
near leg is back until he touches once
he touches i can safely step in

264
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
he touches i can safely step in
 

265
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,030
he touches i can safely step in
now this stepping in is going to feel

266
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
now this stepping in is going to feel
 

267
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,630
now this stepping in is going to feel
better to you because now i have more

268

weight over the top of him
 

271
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,110
weight over the top of him
so it's going to be easier for me to

272
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
so it's going to be easier for me to
 

273
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
so it's going to be easier for me to
control this guy now how do i get him

274
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
control this guy now how do i get him
 

275
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,830
control this guy now how do i get him
down

276
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,710
in
i will bump him off balance and he'll

282
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
i will bump him off balance and he'll
 

283
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,149
i will bump him off balance and he'll
pretty much get broken down at that

284
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
pretty much get broken down at that
 

285
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,429
pretty much get broken down at that
point right so that would be really

286
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
point right so that would be really
 

287
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,470

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
once his hand touches that's what's
 

329
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,469
once his hand touches that's what's
helping him balance over there

330
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
helping him balance over there
 

331
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,830
helping him balance over there
he's got nothing balancing over here so

332
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
he's got nothing balancing over here so
 

333
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,070
he's got nothing balancing over here so
if he's shot his hand out so far that i

334
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
if he's shot his hand out so far that i
 

335
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,350
if he's shot his hand out so far that i
didn't break his balance there

336
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
didn't break his balance there
 

337
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,590
didn't break his balance there
there's a possibility to pull him into

338
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
there's a possibility to pull him into
 

339
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,629
there's a possibility to pull him into
this gap here

340
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
this gap here
 

341
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,990
this gap here
to break him down right there and that's

342
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
to break him down right there and that's
 

343
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,510
to break him down right there and that's
what i'd like to have is have that

344
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
what i'd like to have is have that
 

345
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,629
what i'd like to have is have that
little gap happen

346
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
little gap happen
 

347
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,029
little gap happen
but he can also shoot his hand out here

348
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
but he can also shoot his hand out here
 

349
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,390
but he can also shoot his hand out here
to stop that from happening

350
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
to stop that from happening
 

351
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,469
to stop that from happening
but now he's not balanced over there so

352
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
but now he's not balanced over there so
 

353
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,150
but now he's not balanced over there so
i'll drive into that right

354
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
i'll drive into that right
 

355
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,230
i'll drive into that right
so what i'm trying to do when i when i'm

356
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
so what i'm trying to do when i when i'm
 

357
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,990
so what i'm trying to do when i when i'm
trying to get the take down from here

358
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
trying to get the take down from here
 

359
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,550
trying to get the take down from here
is move back and forth like this so he

360
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
is move back and forth like this so he
 

361
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,469
is move back and forth like this so he
only has one hand to balance himself

362
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
only has one hand to balance himself
 

363
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,070
only has one hand to balance himself
and eventually i should be able to break

364
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
and eventually i should be able to break
 

365
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,590
and eventually i should be able to break
him down by going back and forth back

366
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
him down by going back and forth back
 

367
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,950
him down by going back and forth back
and forth back and forth like that

368
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
and forth back and forth like that
 

369
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,390
and forth back and forth like that
okay now as i'm doing this there's

370
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
okay now as i'm doing this there's
 

371
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,909
okay now as i'm doing this there's
several things i can do with the arm

372
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
several things i can do with the arm
 

373
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,550
several things i can do with the arm
okay

374
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560

he's touching once he touches i know
that he's not stable on just the two

490
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
that he's not stable on just the two
 

491
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,909
that he's not stable on just the two
legs so that means it's safe to step in

492
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
legs so that means it's safe to step in
 

493
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,430
legs so that means it's safe to step in
when i step in i want to step in

494
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
when i step in i want to step in
 

495
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,189
when i step in i want to step in
dominantly and ideally i'll just

496
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
dominantly and ideally i'll just
 

497
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,189
dominantly and ideally i'll just
knock him down when i do that if i don't

498
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
knock him down when i do that if i don't
 

499
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,790
knock him down when i do that if i don't
do that i'm going to immediately pull

500
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
do that i'm going to immediately pull
 

501
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,430
do that i'm going to immediately pull
him back

502
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
him back
 

503
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,589
him back
to this area right here where he doesn't

504
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
to this area right here where he doesn't
 

505
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,350
to this area right here where he doesn't
have a hand so what he'll probably try

506
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
have a hand so what he'll probably try
 

507
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,550
have a hand so what he'll probably try
to do is shoot his hand over there to

508
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
to do is shoot his hand over there to
 

509
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,749
to do is shoot his hand over there to
keep himself from falling

510
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
keep himself from falling
 

511
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,110
keep himself from falling
and then i'll drive over here so

512
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
and then i'll drive over here so
 

513
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,790
and then i'll drive over here so
basically what's happening is i'm always

514
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
basically what's happening is i'm always
 

515
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,309
basically what's happening is i'm always
pulling where his hand isn't so if his

516
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
pulling where his hand isn't so if his
 

517
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,830
pulling where his hand isn't so if his
hand was here i'm gonna pull him this

518
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
hand was here i'm gonna pull him this
 

519
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,350
hand was here i'm gonna pull him this
way when i pull him this way he'll move

520
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
way when i pull him this way he'll move
 

521
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,950
way when i pull him this way he'll move
his hand over here to stop himself from

522
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
his hand over here to stop himself from
 

523
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,909
his hand over here to stop himself from
falling that way

524
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
falling that way
 

525
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,990
falling that way
then i immediately push back here if he

526
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
then i immediately push back here if he
 

527
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,430
then i immediately push back here if he
moves his hand back here then i pull

528
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
moves his hand back here then i pull
 

529
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,909
