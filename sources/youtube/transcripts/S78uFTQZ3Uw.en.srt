00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,510
vector pressurizing
so if i take this pop around his center

188
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
so if i take this pop around his center
 

189
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,270
so if i take this pop around his center
i'll feel it lightening not pressurizing

190
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
i'll feel it lightening not pressurizing
 

191
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,469
i'll feel it lightening not pressurizing
the pressurized boom is what i'm trying

192
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
the pressurized boom is what i'm trying
 

193
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,590
the pressurized boom is what i'm trying
to do again don't go for a tactic like

194
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
to do again don't go for a tactic like
 

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,189
to do again don't go for a tactic like
you're over here

196
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
you're over here
 

197
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,150
you're over here
it's going for friction pressure

198
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
it's going for friction pressure
 

199
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,150
it's going for friction pressure
friction

200
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160

208
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
reaching their full amplification
 

209
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,550
reaching their full amplification
they also

210
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
they also
 

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,510
they also
can

212
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
can
 

213
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,189
can
assist the other one by taking away

214
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
assist the other one by taking away
 

215
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,430
assist the other one by taking away
either friction or pressure okay so for

216
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
either friction or pressure okay so for
 

217
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,749
either friction or pressure okay so for
example do you do the same thing and

218
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
example do you do the same thing and
 

219
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,430
example do you do the same thing and
let's say you're like going

220
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
let's say you're like going
 

221
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,909
let's say you're like going
whoa lots of pressure and it's starting

222
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
whoa lots of pressure and it's starting
 

223
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,510
whoa lots of pressure and it's starting
to cave your stance or your positioning

224
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
to cave your stance or your positioning
 

225
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,110
to cave your stance or your positioning
in space okay

226
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
in space okay
 

227
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,270
in space okay
so you can change it so i'll come around

228
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
so you can change it so i'll come around
 

229
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,150
so you can change it so i'll come around
this way

230
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160

 

231
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,189

but i feel my base being compromised

232
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
but i feel my base being compromised
 

233
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,189
but i feel my base being compromised
with lots of pressure i'll come around

234
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
with lots of pressure i'll come around
 

235
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,830
with lots of pressure i'll come around
this way

236
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840

 

237
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,230

so what i did is felt the pressure

238
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
so what i did is felt the pressure
 

239
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,749
so what i did is felt the pressure
pressure pressure pressure on here

240
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
pressure pressure pressure on here
 

241
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,350
pressure pressure pressure on here
starting to cave my base or my

242
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
starting to cave my base or my
 

243
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,390
starting to cave my base or my
positioning and so it yields and picks

244
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
positioning and so it yields and picks
 

245
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,390
positioning and so it yields and picks
up the same pressure

246
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
up the same pressure
 

247
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,749
up the same pressure
on that side

248
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759

 

249
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,589

in the same way

250
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
in the same way
 

251
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,869
in the same way
what i do between my hands i can do with

252
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
what i do between my hands i can do with
 

253
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,469
what i do between my hands i can do with
my body

254
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
my body
 

255
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,749
my body
so

256
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
so
 

257
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,550
so
friction pressure pressure and i could

258
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
friction pressure pressure and i could
 

259
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,670
friction pressure pressure and i could
yield you see in my stance

260
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
yield you see in my stance
 

261
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,110
yield you see in my stance
ready to go

262
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
ready to go
 

263
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,550
ready to go
this is always much better to do

264
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
this is always much better to do
 

265
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,350
this is always much better to do
than

266
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
than
 

267
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,950
than
this

268
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960

 

269
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,909

you got you got outperformed the work

270
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
you got you got outperformed the work
 

271
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,830
you got you got outperformed the work
requirement was beyond your performance

272
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
requirement was beyond your performance
 

273
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,029
requirement was beyond your performance
envelope

274
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
envelope
 

275
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,869
envelope
or this one

276
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879

 

277
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,510

okay

278
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520

 

279
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,909

so you combining these things

280
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919

 

281
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,589

movement is working

282
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599

 

283
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,869

your goals here with friction

284
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
your goals here with friction
 

285
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:45,509
your goals here with friction
and with pressure

286
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519

 

287
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,590

nobody should have the face over

288
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
nobody should have the face over
 

289
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,870
nobody should have the face over
challenge

290
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
challenge
 

291
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,550
challenge
or their

292
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
or their
 

293
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,389
or their
spatial integrity

294
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
spatial integrity
 

295
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,550
spatial integrity
compromise from being outperformed okay

296
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560

 

297
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,269

standing and we already moved and you

298
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
standing and we already moved and you
 

299
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,430
standing and we already moved and you
can use your movement in the same way as

300
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
can use your movement in the same way as
 

301
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,990
can use your movement in the same way as
previously described we will go back to

302
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
previously described we will go back to
 

303
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,710
previously described we will go back to
uh the

304
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
uh the
 

305
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,389
uh the
but it's the same projection

306
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
but it's the same projection
 

307
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,150
but it's the same projection
meaning i don't i'm not rolling him

308
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
meaning i don't i'm not rolling him
 

309
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,269
meaning i don't i'm not rolling him
i'm looking for the projection

310
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279

 

311
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:40,710

the projection

312
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720

 

313
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,710

okay

314
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
okay
 

315
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,389
okay
so again

316
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
so again
 

317
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,750
so again
coach you paul

318
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
coach you paul
 

319
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,389
coach you paul
i'm not trying to roll him

320
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
i'm not trying to roll him
 

321
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,870
i'm not trying to roll him
i'm not trying to throw him

322
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
i'm not trying to throw him
 

323
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,030
i'm not trying to throw him
you you're closer and caught you whole

324
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
you you're closer and caught you whole
 

325
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,470
you you're closer and caught you whole
with that

326
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
with that
 

327
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,150
with that
with no fall

328
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
with no fall
 

329
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,230
with no fall
you projected and traversed the center

330
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
you projected and traversed the center
 

331
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,470
you projected and traversed the center
across the map okay

332
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
across the map okay
 

333
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,310
across the map okay
so when you come here you're not going

334
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
so when you come here you're not going
 

335
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,590
so when you come here you're not going
like this

336
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
like this
 

337
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,829

345
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,550
his center
is coming up i want the ground better i

346
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
is coming up i want the ground better i
 

347
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:28,710
is coming up i want the ground better i
want to challenge

348
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720

 

349
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:38,710

though

350
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720

 

351
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,910

got it

352
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
got it
 

353
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,829
got it
i don't care which direction

354
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
i don't care which direction
 

355
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,550
i don't care which direction
but it it doesn't roll

356
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
but it it doesn't roll
 

357
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,790
but it it doesn't roll
it gets picked up

358
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
it gets picked up
 

359
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,310
it gets picked up
and traverses the map okay try it again

360
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
and traverses the map okay try it again
 

361
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,590
and traverses the map okay try it again
okay so before we go to uh yokata i have

362
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
okay so before we go to uh yokata i have
 

363
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,550
okay so before we go to uh yokata i have
to

364
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
