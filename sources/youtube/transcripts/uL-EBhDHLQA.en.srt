because that's where your shikaku is but

62
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,190
because that's where your shikaku is but
 

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,130
because that's where your shikaku is but
it's a good one because if you were

64
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,140
it's a good one because if you were
 

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,040
it's a good one because if you were
vectoring you don't have that shikaku

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,050
vectoring you don't have that shikaku
 

67
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,550
vectoring you don't have that shikaku
because I don't have a equal distributed

68
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
because I don't have a equal distributed
 

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,010
because I don't have a equal distributed
status okay so same thing I'm gonna

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,020
status okay so same thing I'm gonna
 

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,410

bring them in and you've got to train me
 

73
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,940
bring them in and you've got to train me
you see and then I do this okay

74
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:00,950
you see and then I do this okay
 

75
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,610
you see and then I do this okay
so as I'm this is bringing his body you

76
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:04,620
so as I'm this is bringing his body you
 

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,210
so as I'm this is bringing his body you
see that okay so but it's not me pulling

78
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,220
see that okay so but it's not me pulling
 

79
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,630
see that okay so but it's not me pulling
him

80
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
him
 

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,960
him
I'm vectoring then vectoring to the

82
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:11,970
I'm vectoring then vectoring to the
 

83
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm vectoring then vectoring to the
other one boom he hits the back foot and

84
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,090
other one boom he hits the back foot and
 

85
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:22,240
other one boom he hits the back foot and
then if I do it wrong of course

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,250
then if I do it wrong of course
 

87
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:42,080
then if I do it wrong of course
okay so one he comes in oh and he gets

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,090
okay so one he comes in oh and he gets
 

89
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,710
okay so one he comes in oh and he gets
that ground back so same thing he's

90
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,720
that ground back so same thing he's
 

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,190
that ground back so same thing he's
pushing right if I if I don't have that

92
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
pushing right if I if I don't have that
 

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,949
pushing right if I if I don't have that
single point then I'll generate a

94
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:51,959
single point then I'll generate a
 

95
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,770
single point then I'll generate a
shikaku diss angle where he's pushing

96
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:54,780
shikaku diss angle where he's pushing
 

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,400
shikaku diss angle where he's pushing
you see oh yeah okay and then also I

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,410
you see oh yeah okay and then also I
 

99
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,400
you see oh yeah okay and then also I
can't go back if I have this Chicago I

100
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,410
can't go back if I have this Chicago I
 

101
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,949
can't go back if I have this Chicago I
can't go back is that it starts to take

102
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959
can't go back is that it starts to take
 

103
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,420
can't go back is that it starts to take
me off the bow starts to push me into

104
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,430
me off the bow starts to push me into
 

105
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,140
me off the bow starts to push me into
this country

106
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,150
this country
 

107
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,869
this country
but if I have the ground vector then

108
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:09,879
but if I have the ground vector then
 

109
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,089
but if I have the ground vector then
you got it so make sure you're not here

110
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:13,099
you got it so make sure you're not here
 

111
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,689
you got it so make sure you're not here
and you're going racing angle a little

112
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:15,699
and you're going racing angle a little
 

113
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,740
and you're going racing angle a little
enforcing okay

114
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:17,750
enforcing okay
 

115

117
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,520
it's here Oh on that I feel that and
then I move it just like the other drill

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,530
then I move it just like the other drill
 

119
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,840
then I move it just like the other drill
okay

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:27,850
okay
 

121

so here there's the Yong Yong clash okay
 

123
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,020
so here there's the Yong Yong clash okay
that Yong Yong clash is where his body

124
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,030
that Yong Yong clash is where his body
 

125
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,439
that Yong Yong clash is where his body
was organized to do it in other words if

126
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:41,449
was organized to do it in other words if
 

127
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,379
was organized to do it in other words if
he leave your amount of gear and get

128
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:44,389
he leave your amount of gear and get
 

129
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,629
he leave your amount of gear and get
your feet see he's not organized at that

130
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:49,639
your feet see he's not organized at that
 

131
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,040
your feet see he's not organized at that
point okay

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,050
point okay
 

133
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,879
point okay
so what I'm going to do is the first the

134
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:54,889
so what I'm going to do is the first the
 

135
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,570
so what I'm going to do is the first the
Jiu Jitsu tactic which is healed to that

136
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:58,580
Jiu Jitsu tactic which is healed to that
 

137
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,390
Jiu Jitsu tactic which is healed to that
okay now he's not as organized do you

138
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,400
okay now he's not as organized do you
 

139
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,050
okay now he's not as organized do you
understand and then so I disorganize him

140
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,060
understand and then so I disorganize him
 

141
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,810
understand and then so I disorganize him
I don't contest this and I take that

142
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:10,820
I don't contest this and I take that
 

143
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,839
I don't contest this and I take that
energy onto my life so he's going to

144
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:16,849
energy onto my life so he's going to
 

145
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,740
energy onto my life so he's going to
come in and it's organized it should hit

146
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:20,750
come in and it's organized it should hit
 

147
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:27,760
come in and it's organized it should hit
it and I yield to it so now when I do it

148
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
it and I yield to it so now when I do it
 

149
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,580
it and I yield to it so now when I do it
it's the same mechanics but he doesn't

150
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:30,590
it's the same mechanics but he doesn't
 

151
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,830
it's the same mechanics but he doesn't
have all the balance that he might have

152
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:32,840
have all the balance that he might have
 

153
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,490
have all the balance that he might have
had before

154
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,500
had before
 

155
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,610
had before
okay but mine now timing has to be

156
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:36,620
okay but mine now timing has to be
 

157
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:45,620
okay but mine now timing has to be
brought into it so he's in you

158
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,630

 

159
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,580

feel in your movement can get smaller

160
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:50,590
feel in your movement can get smaller
 

161
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,730
feel in your movement can get smaller

reconciliation is with the weight shift

174
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:14,760
reconciliation is with the weight shift
 

175
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,150
reconciliation is with the weight shift
that's that's where I do the movie so

176
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
that's that's where I do the movie so
 

177
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,580
that's that's where I do the movie so
our front foot vectoring I'm on the

178
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,590
our front foot vectoring I'm on the
 

179
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,370
our front foot vectoring I'm on the
front foot and then I bring that here

180
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,380
front foot and then I bring that here
 

181
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,370
front foot and then I bring that here
when and the perfect timing I can't go

182
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:26,380
when and the perfect timing I can't go
 

183
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,470
when and the perfect timing I can't go
ahead and hit it needs to be organized

184
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,480
ahead and hit it needs to be organized
 

185
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,060
ahead and hit it needs to be organized
here and I can't relate because that's

186
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,070
here and I can't relate because that's
 

187
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,510
here and I can't relate because that's
the other drills okay so it's just a

188
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:36,520
the other drills okay so it's just a
 

189
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,170
the other drills okay so it's just a
timing um make him go past where he

190
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,180
timing um make him go past where he
 

191
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,910
timing um make him go past where he
wants it's there okay how do you do that

192
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:44,920
wants it's there okay how do you do that
 

193
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,220
wants it's there okay how do you do that
right right when I'm feeling just like

194
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,230
right right when I'm feeling just like
 

195

the weapons I feel that young

196
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:49,630
the weapons I feel that young
 

197
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,370
the weapons I feel that young
I keep easing off that's the end

198
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,380
I keep easing off that's the end
 

199
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,620
I keep easing off that's the end
reconciliation I feel too young and I

200
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:55,630
reconciliation I feel too young and I
 

201
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,250
reconciliation I feel too young and I
ease it off reach out for them let him

202
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,260
ease it off reach out for them let him
 

203
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,290
ease it off reach out for them let him
home and then I do the robot

204
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,300
home and then I do the robot
 

205
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,900
home and then I do the robot
okay this that's the last row

206
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:09,910
okay this that's the last row
 

207
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,750
okay this that's the last row
that's the last row now to do that you

208
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:15,760
that's the last row now to do that you
 

209
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,410
that's the last row now to do that you
had to relax in order to move it from

210
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:19,420
had to relax in order to move it from
 

211
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,550
had to relax in order to move it from
one to the other

212
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
one to the other
 

213
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,550
one to the other
you see if you keep this tension you

214
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
you see if you keep this tension you
 

215
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,150
you see if you keep this tension you
can't move you have to relax and you can

216
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,160
can't move you have to relax and you can
 

217
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,620
can't move you have to relax and you can
move do you understand

218
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:28,630
move do you understand
 

219
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,600
move do you understand
and that's actually what is more

220
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,610
and that's actually what is more
 

221
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,000
and that's actually what is more
important so this is yes we do weight

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,010
important so this is yes we do weight
 

223
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,980
important so this is yes we do weight
shifting all the time but if I weight

224
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:40,990
shifting all the time but if I weight
 

225
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,550
shifting all the time but if I weight
shift with tension then I'm probably

226
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
shift with tension then I'm probably
 

227
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,830
shift with tension then I'm probably
going to be young and get overridden

228
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:46,840
going to be young and get overridden
 

229
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,470
going to be young and get overridden
here okay so it's more that I have go

230
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:52,480
here okay so it's more that I have go
 

231
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,840
here okay so it's more that I have go
ahead I just have the this release I

232
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:57,850
ahead I just have the this release I
 

233
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,450
ahead I just have the this release I
have to release didn't give me some

234
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,460
have to release didn't give me some
 

235
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,040
have to release didn't give me some
energy I just release it and it's enough

236
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,050
energy I just release it and it's enough
 

237
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,190
energy I just release it and it's enough
without any of the other stuff okay so

238
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,200
without any of the other stuff okay so
 

239
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,780
without any of the other stuff okay so
he hits the wall boom hits that release

240
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:14,790
he hits the wall boom hits that release
 

241
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,760
he hits the wall boom hits that release
so I'm not here not here it's just very

242
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:20,770
so I'm not here not here it's just very
 

243
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,480
so I'm not here not here it's just very
relaxed long release and he'll hit the

244
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,490
relaxed long release and he'll hit the
 

245
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,060
relaxed long release and he'll hit the
ground this is energies coming down okay

246
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,070
ground this is energies coming down okay
 

247
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,940
ground this is energies coming down okay
so that's been this next drill and the

248
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:29,950
so that's been this next drill and the
 

249
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,909
so that's been this next drill and the
last one I had a tiny draw and then I

250
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:32,919
last one I had a tiny draw and then I
 

251
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,300
last one I had a tiny draw and then I
went to and this one I let him hit the

252
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,310
went to and this one I let him hit the
 

253
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,240
went to and this one I let him hit the
ground I let it all go to the ground he

254
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,250
ground I let it all go to the ground he
 

255
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,130
ground I let it all go to the ground he
comes in and it is whoa that's it Oh

256
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,140
comes in and it is whoa that's it Oh
 

257
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:51,590
comes in and it is whoa that's it Oh
relax incoming harder that's all okay

258
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
relax incoming harder that's all okay
 

259
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,650
relax incoming harder that's all okay
I'm going to show you why that stillness

260
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:54,660
I'm going to show you why that stillness
 

261
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,650
I'm going to show you why that stillness
important because when I do a hand

262
00:08:59,650 --> 00:08:59,660

change for example it's not yielding
 

265
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,160
change for example it's not yielding
like this okay so it is yielding in

266
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,170
like this okay so it is yielding in
 

267
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,150
like this okay so it is yielding in
terms of it went into his but it's not

271
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,700
with no integrity it's not me getting
out of the way okay so here it is

272
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:18,710
out of the way okay so here it is
 

273
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,790
out of the way okay so here it is
yielding okay let it go and then he can

274
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:21,800
yielding okay let it go and then he can
 

275
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,150
yielding okay let it go and then he can
push on it and you see it's capable of

276
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,160
push on it and you see it's capable of
 

277
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,030
push on it and you see it's capable of
always doing the same thing okay so

278
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,040
always doing the same thing okay so

so just like this is the same subjection

320
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:56,990
so just like this is the same subjection
 

321
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,090
so just like this is the same subjection
and this is the same projection this now

322
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,100
and this is the same projection this now
 

323
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,639
and this is the same projection this now
becomes the same projection won't right

324
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:03,649
becomes the same projection won't right
 

325
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:04,630
becomes the same projection won't right
there

326
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,640
there
 

327
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,810
there
the exact projection just it's EDP not

328
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:07,820
the exact projection just it's EDP not
 

329
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,980
the exact projection just it's EDP not
yet when it's still the ground vectoring

330
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:10,990
yet when it's still the ground vectoring
 

331
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:18,690
yet when it's still the ground vectoring
so yeah they're not yeah just using this

332
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:18,700
so yeah they're not yeah just using this
 

333
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,350
so yeah they're not yeah just using this
