4
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:53,510

so

5
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,110

the first thing is

9
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
the first thing is
 

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,189
the first thing is
your

11

your
 

12
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,590
your
your center has to be expanding okay

13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
your center has to be expanding okay
 

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,870
your center has to be expanding okay
expanding and so that you generate a

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
expanding and so that you generate a
 

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,630
expanding and so that you generate a
relationship

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
relationship
 

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,870
relationship
not through tension but through this

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
not through tension but through this
 

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,789
not through tension but through this
expansion between

21
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
expansion between
 

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,710
expansion between
your hip corners

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
your hip corners
 

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,630
your hip corners
and your shoulder corners so you're not

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
and your shoulder corners so you're not
 

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,870
and your shoulder corners so you're not
doing this

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
doing this
 

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,749
doing this
okay

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
okay
 

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,830
okay
it's expanding expanding

31
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
it's expanding expanding

so
 

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,270
so
this is this is also a marshall a

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
this is this is also a marshall a
 

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,190
this is this is also a marshall a
martial aspect okay

39

places
i don't want it to weaken my structure

47
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
i don't want it to weaken my structure
 

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,190
i don't want it to weaken my structure
just as as he goes to hit me

49

alignment
 

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,670
alignment
but

57
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

so um
 

72
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,830
so um
we'll just test that body you'll do

73
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
we'll just test that body you'll do
 

74
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,229
we'll just test that body you'll do
various strides all over

75
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
various strides all over
 

76
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,910

89
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160

 

90
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:41,589

harder

91
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599

 

92
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,110

um
too often you want to do your martial

97
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
too often you want to do your martial
 

98
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,710
too often you want to do your martial
art but you're not prepared to be hit

99

okay
so

103
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
so
 

104
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,270
so
you

105
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
you
 

106
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,070
you
you always have this spirit of expanding

you always have this spirit of expanding
 

108
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,110
you always have this spirit of expanding
okay

109
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
okay
 

110
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,110
okay
uh you don't have to just aim at the

111
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
uh you don't have to just aim at the
 

112
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,390
uh you don't have to just aim at the
corners here you can aim at the

113
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
corners here you can aim at the
 

114
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,790
corners here you can aim at the
midsection spammers and

115
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
midsection spammers and
 

116
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:26,470
midsection spammers and
have like an aura of invincibility

117
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480

 

118
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,530

okay let's go

119
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,540

 

120
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:41,910

[Applause]

121
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920

 

122
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,910

you feel your mind

123
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920

 

124
00:03:49,920 --> 00:04:00,869

watch my face

125
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879

 

126
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,589

just pulling your mind in okay there you

127
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
just pulling your mind in okay there you
 

128
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:21,430
just pulling your mind in okay there you
go

129
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440

 

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,189

so i still i have that organization and

131
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
so i still i have that organization and
 

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,390
so i still i have that organization and
i do the technique boom

133
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400

 

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:47,189

i don't lose that organization

135
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199

 

136
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,270

the reason this is training is because

137
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
the reason this is training is because
 

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,909
the reason this is training is because
you have two stress points

139
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
you have two stress points
 

140
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,590
you have two stress points
one is here

141
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
one is here
 

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
one is here
and the other one is on the turn which

143
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
and the other one is on the turn which
 

144
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,070
and the other one is on the turn which
is why you do tie no henko okay

145
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
is why you do tie no henko okay
 

146
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,870
is why you do tie no henko okay
so

147
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
so
 

148
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,070
so
on this part right there

149
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
on this part right there
 

150
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,390
on this part right there
hold your organization on the turn

151
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
hold your organization on the turn
 

152
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,270
hold your organization on the turn
hold it on the initial press so you have

153
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
hold it on the initial press so you have
 

154
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,830
hold it on the initial press so you have
two stress points hence you have two

155
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
two stress points hence you have two
 

156
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,430
two stress points hence you have two
adaptation

157
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
adaptation
 

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:25,430
adaptation
possibilities

159
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440

 

160
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:43,670

different

161
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680

 

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,990

it's very tempting that when you're okay

163
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
it's very tempting that when you're okay
 

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,749
it's very tempting that when you're okay
you stop training but that's not the

165
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
you stop training but that's not the
 

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,790
you stop training but that's not the
case you're doing the same drill

167
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
case you're doing the same drill
 

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,790
case you're doing the same drill
but from the yin perspective so

169
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
but from the yin perspective so
 

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,749
but from the yin perspective so
when

171
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
when
 

172
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,629
when
he

173
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
he
 

174
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,230
he
has that first

175
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
has that first
 

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,550
has that first
stress point i have to offer the stress

177
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
stress point i have to offer the stress
 

178
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,749
stress point i have to offer the stress
point if i do this

179
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
point if i do this
 

180
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,830
point if i do this
then i'm not offering the stress point

181
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
then i'm not offering the stress point
 

182
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,029
then i'm not offering the stress point
and i'm no longer holding the expansion

183
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
and i'm no longer holding the expansion
 

184
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,510
and i'm no longer holding the expansion
so my body's pushing

234
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,749
to have that spinal displacement
in your initial attack

235
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,829
this training aspect he's working on
what i'm working on so he maintains

361
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
what i'm working on so he maintains
 

362
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,269
what i'm working on so he maintains
expansion

363
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
expansion
 

364
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,590
expansion
he provides territoriality and

365
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
he provides territoriality and
 

366
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,829
he provides territoriality and
commitment noted in the grip

367
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
commitment noted in the grip
 

368
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,710
commitment noted in the grip
okay uh

369
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
okay uh
 

370
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,150
okay uh
keep

371
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
keep
 

372
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,470
keep
he keeps expansion through the kazushi

373
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
he keeps expansion through the kazushi
 

374
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,389
he keeps expansion through the kazushi
that's where he he experiences the yield

375
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
that's where he he experiences the yield
 

376
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,949
that's where he he experiences the yield
so the yield right there

377
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
so the yield right there
 

378
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,110
so the yield right there
out of your fear you'll break it and

379
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
out of your fear you'll break it and
 

380
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,790
out of your fear you'll break it and
you'll want to walk through it you're

381
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
you'll want to walk through it you're
 

382
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,550
you'll want to walk through it you're
going to you go here and then you go

383
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
going to you go here and then you go
 

384
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,670
going to you go here and then you go
here you broke it broke expansion

385
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680

 

386
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,430

you'll hear me say you've disengaged

387
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
you'll hear me say you've disengaged
 

388
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,910
you'll hear me say you've disengaged
your center activate your center so

389
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
your center activate your center so
 

390
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,069
your center activate your center so
that's what's happening you're here you

391
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
that's what's happening you're here you
 

392
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,310
that's what's happening you're here you
break expansion

393
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
break expansion
 

394
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,870
break expansion
keep expansion and allow yourself to

395
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
keep expansion and allow yourself to
 

396
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,150
keep expansion and allow yourself to
fall

397
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
fall
 

398
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,509
fall
into

399
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
into
 

400
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,389
into
the void

401
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399

 

402
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,470

and then at the end

403
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
and then at the end
 

404
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,110
and then at the end
is also where you'll see someone break

405
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
is also where you'll see someone break
 

406
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,069
is also where you'll see someone break
expansion because they'll feel like oh

407
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
expansion because they'll feel like oh
 

408
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,990
expansion because they'll feel like oh
i'm done okay

409
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
i'm done okay
 

410
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,870
i'm done okay
so i have one stressor point here

411
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
so i have one stressor point here
 

412
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,269
so i have one stressor point here
i have the other stretching point here

413
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
i have the other stretching point here
 

414
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,509
i have the other stretching point here
and i'm supposed to maintain expansion

415
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
and i'm supposed to maintain expansion
 

416
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,069
and i'm supposed to maintain expansion
throughout the entire technique so if

417
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
throughout the entire technique so if
 

418
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,710
throughout the entire technique so if
you have a third you get he'll come and

419
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
you have a third you get he'll come and
 

420
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,550
you have a third you get he'll come and
check on you

421
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
check on you
 

422
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,590
check on you
right here you're going to push

423
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
right here you're going to push
 

424
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,069
right here you're going to push
you can push both hands both hands over

425
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
you can push both hands both hands over
 

426
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,430
you can push both hands both hands over
here

427
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440

 

428
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,509

and nothing changes

429
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
and nothing changes
 

430
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,430
and nothing changes
me me

431
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
me me
 

432
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,190
me me
when i go

433
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
when i go
 

434
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,550
when i go
i'm very relaxed and comes in and then i

435
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
i'm very relaxed and comes in and then i
 

436
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,150
i'm very relaxed and comes in and then i
get ready for him can you see that

437
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160

 

438
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,949

expansion boom here he comes nothing

439
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
expansion boom here he comes nothing
 

440
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,069
expansion boom here he comes nothing
changes in my body nothing at all okay

441
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
changes in my body nothing at all okay
 

442
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:43,030
changes in my body nothing at all okay
you're still doing the same thing

443
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040

 

444
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,470

oh still expansion still expansion

445
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
oh still expansion still expansion
 

446
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,389
oh still expansion still expansion
all right let's go

447
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
all right let's go
 

448
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,470
all right let's go
okay so continuing on what you're

449
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
okay so continuing on what you're
 

450
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,790
okay so continuing on what you're
working on in chinese

451
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
working on in chinese
 

452
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,190
working on in chinese
you're also working on the

453
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200

 

454
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,710

the combative geometry

455
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
the combative geometry
 

456
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,670
the combative geometry
to use jiu jitsu okay so

457
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
to use jiu jitsu okay so
 

458
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,470
to use jiu jitsu okay so
somewhere you're going to reconcile

459
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
somewhere you're going to reconcile
 

460
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,829
somewhere you're going to reconcile
an attack

461
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
an attack
 

462
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,430
an attack
with yin

463
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
with yin
 

464
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,949
with yin
it'll almost always be on a circle

465
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
it'll almost always be on a circle
 

466
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,790
it'll almost always be on a circle
then as you reconcile the yin within

467
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
then as you reconcile the yin within
 

468
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,790
then as you reconcile the yin within
you'll enter

469
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
you'll enter
 

470
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,750
you'll enter
then you'll ten con okay

471
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
then you'll ten con okay
 

472
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,230
then you'll ten con okay
uh that'll always happen so let's say

473
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
uh that'll always happen so let's say
 

474
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,870
uh that'll always happen so let's say
we're fighting he comes in that right

475
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
we're fighting he comes in that right
 

476
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,430
we're fighting he comes in that right
there that what i did right here that's

477
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
there that what i did right here that's
 

478
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,030
there that what i did right here that's
a yin reconciliation

479
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040

 

480
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,350

he's going to keep entering right

481
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
he's going to keep entering right
 

482
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,269
he's going to keep entering right
there's my uh

483
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
there's my uh
 

484
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,470
there's my uh
enter right here he's going to re-engage

485
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
enter right here he's going to re-engage
 

486
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,350
enter right here he's going to re-engage
and that's yours

487
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360

 

488
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,430

somewhere some variation of that will

489
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
somewhere some variation of that will
 

490
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,910
somewhere some variation of that will
come up the fight starts to

491
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
come up the fight starts to
 

492
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,829
come up the fight starts to
rotate in this

493
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
rotate in this
 

494
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,590
rotate in this
moving spiral across the map okay

495
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
moving spiral across the map okay
 

496
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,509
moving spiral across the map okay
so

497
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
so
 

498
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,990
so
the first part is the yin reconciliation

499
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
the first part is the yin reconciliation
 

500
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,949
the first part is the yin reconciliation
as he

501
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
as he
 

502
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,910
as he
is doing the territoriality i'm going to

503
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
is doing the territoriality i'm going to
 

504
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,829
is doing the territoriality i'm going to
shift my weight

505
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
shift my weight
 

506
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,670
shift my weight
ever so slightly

507
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
ever so slightly
 

508
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,470
ever so slightly
i'm not going to turn

509
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
i'm not going to turn
 

510
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,069
i'm not going to turn
with double weighted feet

511
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
with double weighted feet
 

512
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,189
with double weighted feet
whoa that was it

513
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199

 

514
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,990

that also establishes the ground vector

515
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
that also establishes the ground vector
 

516
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,230
that also establishes the ground vector
so he's pushing and this foot's

517
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
so he's pushing and this foot's
 

518
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,030
so he's pushing and this foot's
irrelevant now to his territoriality

519
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
irrelevant now to his territoriality
 

520
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,949
irrelevant now to his territoriality
okay

521
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
okay
 

522
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,189
okay
so it starts to lead into the internal

523
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
so it starts to lead into the internal
 

524
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,150
so it starts to lead into the internal
training

525
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
training
 

526
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,670
training
so pull single pivot point

527
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
so pull single pivot point
 

528
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,310
so pull single pivot point
start the rotation

529
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
start the rotation
 

530
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,189
start the rotation
enter into the empty space

531
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
enter into the empty space
 

532
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,470
enter into the empty space

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,990

okay so let's go back

577
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
okay so let's go back
 

578
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,710
okay so let's go back
let's uh micro drill the first yield and

579
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
let's uh micro drill the first yield and
 

580
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,389
let's uh micro drill the first yield and
understand what's going on

581
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
understand what's going on
 

582
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,269
understand what's going on
okay

583
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
okay
 

584
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,990
okay
you will you want to always establish a

585
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
you will you want to always establish a
 

586
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,389
you will you want to always establish a
ground path

587
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
ground path
 

588
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,470
ground path
and when you rotate you always have a

589
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
and when you rotate you always have a
 

590
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,110
and when you rotate you always have a
single pivot point you never double

591
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
single pivot point you never double
 

592
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,509
single pivot point you never double
pivot never double pivot

593
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519

 

594
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,629

so i know on the on the edema on the

595
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
so i know on the on the edema on the
 

596
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,870
so i know on the on the edema on the
entrain it's gonna be on a turn so i'm

597
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
entrain it's gonna be on a turn so i'm
 

598
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,110
entrain it's gonna be on a turn so i'm
gonna have to pivot on that okay so i

599
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
gonna have to pivot on that okay so i
 

600
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,189
gonna have to pivot on that okay so i
want a single pivot point

601
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
want a single pivot point
 

602
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,389
want a single pivot point
and i want to use my internal aspects

603
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
and i want to use my internal aspects
 

604
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,350
and i want to use my internal aspects
and so i always want a ground vector

605
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
and so i always want a ground vector
 

606
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,389
and so i always want a ground vector
okay

607
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
okay
 

608
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,110
okay
so we're just micro drilling that i also

609
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
so we're just micro drilling that i also
 

610
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,310
so we're just micro drilling that i also
know i want a yin yield that's the yin

611
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
know i want a yin yield that's the yin
 

612
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,629
know i want a yin yield that's the yin
yield

613
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639

 

614
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,430

so if i

615
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
so if i
 

616
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,269
so if i

he's pushing
 

618
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,590
he's pushing
i'm not going anywhere because i can

619
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
i'm not going anywhere because i can
 

620
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,710
i'm not going anywhere because i can
establish a ground vector anywhere i am

621
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
establish a ground vector anywhere i am
 

622
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,509
establish a ground vector anywhere i am
okay

623
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
okay
 

624
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,870
okay
i'm yielding out of strategic reasons

625
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880

 

626
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,029

so i'm on the back foot

627
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
so i'm on the back foot
 

628
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,470
so i'm on the back foot
i have no weight on the front foot

629
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
i have no weight on the front foot
 

630
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,350
i have no weight on the front foot
but i have the ground vector

631
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360

 

632
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,990

let him move me onto the back foot

633
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
let him move me onto the back foot
 

634
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,510
let him move me onto the back foot

you see i'm turning

643
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000

 

644
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,990

different

648
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,190

oh

649
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
oh
 

650
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,549
oh
he pushes

651
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
he pushes
 

652
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,789
he pushes
i move it to the back foot

653
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
i move it to the back foot
 

654
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,590
i move it to the back foot
if you want you can test he's pushing it

655
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
if you want you can test he's pushing it
 

656
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,669
if you want you can test he's pushing it
doesn't matter whatever i'm doing with

657
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
doesn't matter whatever i'm doing with
 

658
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,110
doesn't matter whatever i'm doing with
that back foot

659
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
that back foot
 

660
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:04,710
that back foot
does not matter

661
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720

 

662
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:15,669

so

663
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679

 

664
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,350

okay

665
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
okay
 

666
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,909
okay
let's get that going micro drill help

667
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
let's get that going micro drill help
 

668
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,350
let's get that going micro drill help
okay your art is made up of energetic

669
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
okay your art is made up of energetic
 

670
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,270
okay your art is made up of energetic
things but it is also made up of

671
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
things but it is also made up of
 

672
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,630
things but it is also made up of
mechanical things okay

673
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
mechanical things okay
 

674
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,590
mechanical things okay
so

675
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
so
 

676
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,190
so
his first

677
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
his first
 

678
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,789
his first

682
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,150
stressor
i have expansion four corner

683
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
i have expansion four corner
 

684
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,750
i have expansion four corner
organization

685
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
organization
 

686
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,630
organization
and i established a ground vector

687
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
and i established a ground vector
 

688
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,029
and i established a ground vector
now mechanically you want to also

689
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
now mechanically you want to also
 

690
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,270
now mechanically you want to also
understand angle cancellation

691
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280

 

692
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,190

so when you do this you never want his

693
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
so when you do this you never want his
 

694
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,710
so when you do this you never want his
hand to go down

695
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
hand to go down
 

696
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,950
hand to go down
angle cancellation is

697
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
angle cancellation is
 

698
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,430
angle cancellation is
best achieved through two zones through

699
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
best achieved through two zones through
 

700
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,310
best achieved through two zones through
dimensions so in this case it's going to

701
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
dimensions so in this case it's going to
 

702
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,830
dimensions so in this case it's going to
be uh width and height

703
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
be uh width and height
 

704
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,590
be uh width and height
so i don't want to just go down that

705
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
so i don't want to just go down that
 

706
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,430
so i don't want to just go down that
would be height only

707
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
would be height only
 

708
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,750
would be height only
i want width and height

709
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
i want width and height
 

710
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,470
i want width and height
tilt is what we use most of the time

711
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
tilt is what we use most of the time
 

712
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,029
tilt is what we use most of the time
in our aikido okay so we don't want to

732
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,590

and weight is on it

733
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
and weight is on it
 

734
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,150

then i enter

735
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160

748
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,310
i don't want to enter so that i'm on the
bottom side of the circle because i'm

bottom side of the circle because i'm
 

750
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,230
bottom side of the circle because i'm
going to have to pull this thing

going to have to pull this thing
 

752
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,990

of course if i have good expansion you

755
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
of course if i have good expansion you
 

756
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,870
of course if i have good expansion you
can do it

757
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
can do it
 

758
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,470
can do it
but partially not as sound

760
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,390

and that's going to require you
 

778
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,950
and that's going to require you
to be on the

to be on the
 

780
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,669
to be on the
top side of the circle and you will not

781
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
top side of the circle and you will not
 

782
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,950
top side of the circle and you will not
pull

you should not feel their fingers
 

812
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:56,230
you should not feel their fingers
anymore you reconcile the grip

813
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240

 

814
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,110

so the question i

815
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
so the question i
 

816
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,430
so the question i
if you've studied with me for a while

817
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
if you've studied with me for a while
 

818
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,549
if you've studied with me for a while
you know we used to talk about

819
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
you know we used to talk about
 

820
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,390
you know we used to talk about
uh

821
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,400
uh
 

822
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,110
uh
extension

823
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
extension
 

824
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,070
extension
and as i watched

825
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
and as i watched
 

826
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,070
and as i watched
you try to learn uh i started

827
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
you try to learn uh i started
 

828
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,110
you try to learn uh i started
saying

829
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
saying
 

830
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,470
saying
not tension extension or extension is

831
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
not tension extension or extension is
 

832
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,830
not tension extension or extension is
not tension

833
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
not tension
 

834
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,630
not tension
okay because

835
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
okay because
 

836
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,029
okay because
when you try to

837
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
when you try to
 

838
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,789
when you try to
hold him at bay

839
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
hold him at bay
 

840
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,630
hold him at bay
you just

841
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
you just
 

842
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,630
you just
think this is extension but you're

843
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
think this is extension but you're
 

844
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,110
think this is extension but you're
flexing everything okay

845
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
flexing everything okay
 

846
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,870
flexing everything okay
and that is not

847
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
and that is not
 

848
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,590
and that is not
it

849
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
it
 

850
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,669
it
okay that's that is a fear response

851
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
okay that's that is a fear response
 

852
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,470
okay that's that is a fear response
and

853
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
and
 

854
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,029
and
that is not a yin yielding

855
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
that is not a yin yielding
 

856
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,190
that is not a yin yielding
and there's no way you can get the

857
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
and there's no way you can get the
 

858
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,990
and there's no way you can get the
internal aspects through that tension

859
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
internal aspects through that tension
 

860
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,190
internal aspects through that tension
okay it's also not martial

861
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
okay it's also not martial
 

862
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,310
okay it's also not martial
it's very very hard to move quickly

863
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
it's very very hard to move quickly
 

864
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,070
it's very very hard to move quickly
and responsibly

865
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
and responsibly
 

866
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,310
and responsibly
when i am very tense

867
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320

okay so maybe at first when you're

869
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
okay so maybe at first when you're
 

870
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,750
okay so maybe at first when you're
trying our beginner coq drills you're

871
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
trying our beginner coq drills you're
 

872
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,590
trying our beginner coq drills you're
like this do you see

873
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
like this do you see
 

874
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,470
like this do you see
and

875
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
and
 

876
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,549
and
it'll never translate into any time we

877
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
it'll never translate into any time we
 

878
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,789
it'll never translate into any time we
have to move past this okay

879
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
have to move past this okay
 

880
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,510
have to move past this okay
and if we're going more live you will

881
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
and if we're going more live you will
 

882
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,510
and if we're going more live you will
not be able to function at all it just

883
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
not be able to function at all it just
 

884
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,710
not be able to function at all it just
doesn't function so i'm definitely not a

885
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
doesn't function so i'm definitely not a
 

886
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,549
doesn't function so i'm definitely not a
fan of

887
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559

is all in the midsection

1263
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
is all in the midsection
 

1264
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,029
is all in the midsection
so you always

1265
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
so you always
 

1266
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,669
so you always
collapse the midsection

1267
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
collapse the midsection
 

1268
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,230
collapse the midsection
before you even know it

1269
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
before you even know it
 

1270
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,029
before you even know it
okay

1271
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
okay
 

1272
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,269
okay
so he comes in

1273
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
so he comes in
 

1274
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,710
so he comes in
we're doing our drill and i know that i

1275
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
we're doing our drill and i know that i
 

1276
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,909
we're doing our drill and i know that i
have to

1277
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
have to
 

1278
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,310
have to
go here you see

1279
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
go here you see
 

1280
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,110
go here you see
no i have a desire since i said to go

1281
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
no i have a desire since i said to go
 

1282
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,389
no i have a desire since i said to go
there i have a desire and i desire not

1283
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
there i have a desire and i desire not
 

1284
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,310
there i have a desire and i desire not
to do this

1285
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,320
to do this
 

1286
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,710
to do this
and already that thing has weakened oh

1287
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
and already that thing has weakened oh
 

1288
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,549
and already that thing has weakened oh
oh you don't realize it but you already

1289
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,559
oh you don't realize it but you already
 

1290
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,470
oh you don't realize it but you already
weakened it okay

1291
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
weakened it okay
 

1292
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,750
weakened it okay
so

1293
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
so
 

1294
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,029
so
i i have to be desireless so i can get

1295
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:31,039
i i have to be desireless so i can get
 

1296
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,029
i i have to be desireless so i can get
here

1297
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
here
 

1298
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,190
here
i don't have any fear because i don't

1299
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
i don't have any fear because i don't
 

1300
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,070
i don't have any fear because i don't
have a

1301
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
have a
 

1302
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,190
have a
dichotomy between between him and i

1303
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
dichotomy between between him and i
 

1304
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,549
dichotomy between between him and i
so it's not

1305
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
so it's not
 

1306
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,750
so it's not
nage versus uke that's not what's going

1307
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
nage versus uke that's not what's going
 

1308
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,509
nage versus uke that's not what's going
on i'm already in an expanded state and

1309
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
on i'm already in an expanded state and
 

1310
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,509
on i'm already in an expanded state and
you'll just land there

1311
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
you'll just land there
 

1312
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,830
you'll just land there
without that tension

1313
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
without that tension
 

1314
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,630
without that tension
or

1315
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
or
 

1316
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,470
or
the opposite

1317
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
the opposite
 

1318
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,549
the opposite
which is the need for tension let's say

1319
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
which is the need for tension let's say
 

1320
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,990
which is the need for tension let's say
as you're experiencing it subjectively

1321
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000

 

1322
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,669

that wasn't it either

1323
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
that wasn't it either
 

1324
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,789
that wasn't it either
okay

1325
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
okay
 

1326
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,950
okay
so expansion expansion expansion

1327
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
so expansion expansion expansion
 

1328
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,750
so expansion expansion expansion
expansion expansion

1329
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:14,760

 

1330
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,509

non-contestation means unification

1331
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
non-contestation means unification
 

1332
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,549
non-contestation means unification
between

1333
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
between
 

1334
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,590
between
uke and nage means no difference between

1335
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
uke and nage means no difference between
 

1336
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,509
uke and nage means no difference between
and nadia

1337
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
and nadia
 

1338
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,430
and nadia
no difference between moving and not

1339
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
no difference between moving and not
 

1340
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,669
no difference between moving and not
moving either once i get all those

1341
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:27,679
moving either once i get all those
 

1342
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,789
moving either once i get all those
things around i can truly have expansion

1343
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
things around i can truly have expansion
 

1344
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,509
things around i can truly have expansion
and therefore have relaxed movement

1345
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
and therefore have relaxed movement
 

1346
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,830
and therefore have relaxed movement
with the structural integrity of

1347
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:35,840
with the structural integrity of
 

1348
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,029
with the structural integrity of
expansion versus a structural integrity

1349
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
expansion versus a structural integrity
 

1350
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,830
expansion versus a structural integrity
only through tension

1351
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840
only through tension
 

1352
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,190
only through tension
okay do you understand

1353
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
okay do you understand
