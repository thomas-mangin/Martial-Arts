see that? I just trading which foot the
ground the energy is going to. So when

166
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
ground the energy is going to. So when
 

167
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,590
ground the energy is going to. So when
she pulls, it goes to the front foot.

168
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:53,600
she pulls, it goes to the front foot.
 

169
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,150
she pulls, it goes to the front foot.
When she pushes, goes to the back foot.

170
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
When she pushes, goes to the back foot.
 

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,990
When she pushes, goes to the back foot.
Do you see that? So not not my

172
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
Do you see that? So not not my
 

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,790
Do you see that? So not not my
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.

174
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.
 

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,110
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's

176
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's
 

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,550
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's
in the front. I'm not doing that. I'm

178
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
in the front. I'm not doing that. I'm
 

179
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,749
in the front. I'm not doing that. I'm
just shifting. Okay. Just shifting. Just

180
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
just shifting. Okay. Just shifting. Just
 

181
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:19,430
just shifting. Okay. Just shifting. Just
shifting where I'm at. And I go

182
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440

 

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,390

front foot. Not here. Front foot.

184
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400

 

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,909

Back foot.

186
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919

 

187
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,870

Okay. Try it again. Got it.

188
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
Okay. Try it again. Got it.
 

189
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,670
Okay. Try it again. Got it.
Okay. So, you're you're pulling. You see

190
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
Okay. So, you're you're pulling. You see
 

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,790
Okay. So, you're you're pulling. You see
the stalemate?

192
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
the stalemate?
 

193
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
the stalemate?
>> Like it were here. I I start turning it.

194
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
>> Like it were here. I I start turning it.
 

195
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,270
>> Like it were here. I I start turning it.
>> Hi.

196
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
>> Hi.
 

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,230
>> Hi.

>> Do you see?
 

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,870
>> Do you see?
>> Okay. And then I try to pin it.

200
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
>> Okay. And then I try to pin it.
 

201
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,350
>> Okay. And then I try to pin it.
>> Hi.

202

>> Hi.
 

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,870
>> Hi.
>> Okay. And if I pin that foot

204
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:48,880
>> Okay. And if I pin that foot
 

205
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,629
>> Okay. And if I pin that foot
just like I can make you pick up the

206
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
just like I can make you pick up the
 

207
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,390
just like I can make you pick up the
back foot. Do you see?

208
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
back foot. Do you see?
 

209
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,029
back foot. Do you see?
>> But you'll be able to put the back foot

210
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
>> But you'll be able to put the back foot
 

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,670
>> But you'll be able to put the back foot
down and then change the pin on the

212
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
down and then change the pin on the
 

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,670
down and then change the pin on the
front foot. If I There's the pin on the

214
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
front foot. If I There's the pin on the
 

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,950
front foot. If I There's the pin on the
front foot.

216
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
front foot.
 

217
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,749
front foot.
>> Right. put the back foot down and move

218
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
>> Right. put the back foot down and move
 

219
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,430
>> Right. put the back foot down and move
the front foot now. Do you see that?

220
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
the front foot now. Do you see that?
 

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,430
the front foot now. Do you see that?
>> Okay. So, that's just because you stayed

222
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
>> Okay. So, that's just because you stayed
 

223
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,950
>> Okay. So, that's just because you stayed
on that pin.

224
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
on that pin.
 

225
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,189
on that pin.
>> So, as you go to move, I keep doing it.

226
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
>> So, as you go to move, I keep doing it.
 

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,390
>> So, as you go to move, I keep doing it.
>> Do you understand?

228
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
>> Do you understand?
 

229
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,510
>> Do you understand?
>> And then it's easier. So, uh, start

230
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
>> And then it's easier. So, uh, start
 

231
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,589
>> And then it's easier. So, uh, start
turning it. There's the pin on that

232
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
turning it. There's the pin on that
 

233
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,830
turning it. There's the pin on that
foot. Do you get it? [snorts]

234
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
foot. Do you get it? [snorts]
 

235
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,909
foot. Do you get it? [snorts]
>> You're pulling right home. There's the

236
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
>> You're pulling right home. There's the
 

237
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,110
>> You're pulling right home. There's the
turn. And right when you go there, I

238
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
turn. And right when you go there, I
 

239
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,589
turn. And right when you go there, I
take advantage of that. Okay. as opposed

240
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
take advantage of that. Okay. as opposed
 

241
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,029
take advantage of that. Okay. as opposed
to let you get that. So when you go

242
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
to let you get that. So when you go
 

243
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,509
to let you get that. So when you go
I could do it here or I could do it here

244
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
I could do it here or I could do it here
 

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,670
I could do it here or I could do it here
>> when you go one foot. Okay. But you have

246
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
>> when you go one foot. Okay. But you have
 

247
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,310
>> when you go one foot. Okay. But you have
to stay in it. Okay.

248
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
to stay in it. Okay.
 

249
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,310
to stay in it. Okay.
You're going here. Okay. So right when

250
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
You're going here. Okay. So right when
 

251
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,910
You're going here. Okay. So right when
here like I turn. Okay. So you you you

252
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
here like I turn. Okay. So you you you
 

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,030
here like I turn. Okay. So you you you
to turn one part has to either not move

254
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
to turn one part has to either not move
 

255
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,430
to turn one part has to either not move
and the other part has to move or one

256
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
and the other part has to move or one
 

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,829
and the other part has to move or one
part can move slower than the other part

258
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
part can move slower than the other part
 

259
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,750
part can move slower than the other part
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you

260
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you
 

261
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,150
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you
see that? I move both parts together

262
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
see that? I move both parts together
 

263
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,389
see that? I move both parts together
it's not going to happen. Okay. If I go

264
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
it's not going to happen. Okay. If I go
 

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,710
it's not going to happen. Okay. If I go
here because you keep resisting this

266
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
here because you keep resisting this
 

267
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,310
here because you keep resisting this
technique we just are changing the

268
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
technique we just are changing the
 

269
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,070
technique we just are changing the
relationship. That's all we're doing.

270
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
relationship. That's all we're doing.
 

271
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,509
relationship. That's all we're doing.
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the

272
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the
 

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,590
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the
beginning, one side either stops, the

274
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
beginning, one side either stops, the
 

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,750
beginning, one side either stops, the
other side turns there. There's the

276
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
other side turns there. There's the
 

277
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,590
other side turns there. There's the
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work

278
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work
 

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,269
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work
with whatever they're doing on you.

280
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
with whatever they're doing on you.
 

281
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,590
with whatever they're doing on you.
Okay. So we're back where we started.

282
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
Okay. So we're back where we started.
 

283
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay. So we're back where we started.
Right.

284
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
Right.
 

285
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,990
Right.
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one

286
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one
 

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,949
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one
boom. And as you do that, I take you

288
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
boom. And as you do that, I take you
 

289
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,310
boom. And as you do that, I take you
further in. Do you see? Okay. And then

290
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
further in. Do you see? Okay. And then
 

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,990
further in. Do you see? Okay. And then
now, this is what always happens is as

292
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
now, this is what always happens is as
 

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,110
now, this is what always happens is as
you try to not fall, you now stopped

294
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
you try to not fall, you now stopped
 

295
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,910
you try to not fall, you now stopped
pulling and you're now pushing on me. Do

296
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
pulling and you're now pushing on me. Do
 

297
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,829
pulling and you're now pushing on me. Do
do you see that? And so that's what I

298
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
do you see that? And so that's what I
 

299
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,310
do you see that? And so that's what I
use.

300
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
use.
 

301
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,310
use.
>> Okay. But you have to be sensitive to

302
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
>> Okay. But you have to be sensitive to
 

303
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,030
>> Okay. But you have to be sensitive to
it.

304
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
it.
 

305
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,310
it.
>> So one side moves the other one moves at

306
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
>> So one side moves the other one moves at
 

307
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,389
>> So one side moves the other one moves at
a different rate. Do you see?

308
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
a different rate. Do you see?
 

309
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,670
a different rate. Do you see?
>> Okay. And we're going. There's that

310
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
>> Okay. And we're going. There's that
 

311
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,190
>> Okay. And we're going. There's that
step.

312
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
step.
 

313
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:55,750
step.
And you

314
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760

 

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,509

Boom. There it is.

316
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
Boom. There it is.
 

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,990
Boom. There it is.
Good. Let you have it if you come up.

318
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
Good. Let you have it if you come up.
 

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,870
Good. Let you have it if you come up.
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see

320
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see
 

321
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:36,150
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see
that one?

322
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160

 

323
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,870

Go back here or over here. No, you were

324
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
Go back here or over here. No, you were
 

325
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,430
Go back here or over here. No, you were
there and you felt that one coming,

326
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
there and you felt that one coming,
 

327
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,990
there and you felt that one coming,
right?

328
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
right?
 

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,150
right?
>> So, you pushed and [snorts] I go here

330
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
>> So, you pushed and [snorts] I go here
 

331
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,030
>> So, you pushed and [snorts] I go here
and we're over here now. See?

332
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
and we're over here now. See?
 

333
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,910
and we're over here now. See?
And then you felt you push on me.

334
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
And then you felt you push on me.
 

335
00:11:49,920 --> 00:12:13,829
And then you felt you push on me.
Boom.

336
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839

 

337
00:12:13,839 --> 00:13:05,829

There it is.

338
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839

 

339
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,990

Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll

340
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll
 

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,629
Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll
take the spine time. Do you understand?

342
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
take the spine time. Do you understand?
 

343
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,470
take the spine time. Do you understand?
Okay. So, we're coming in here,

344
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
Okay. So, we're coming in here,
 

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,190
Okay. So, we're coming in here,
right? And then you go in this way and

346
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
right? And then you go in this way and
 

347
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,790
right? And then you go in this way and
disarm yield.

348
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
disarm yield.
 

349
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,790
disarm yield.
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine

350
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine
 

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,389
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine
line.

352
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
line.
 

353
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,430
line.
Okay.

354
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440

 

355
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,470

You have to feel all that. So, boom.

356
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
You have to feel all that. So, boom.
 

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,710
You have to feel all that. So, boom.
Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the
 

359
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,350
Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the
foot to it's too low for you to do

360
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
foot to it's too low for you to do
 

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,430

anything with the stepping. You can do
 

363
00:13:39,440 --> 00:14:19,030
anything with the stepping. You can do

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,590

there's the yin yield.

374
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
there's the yin yield.
 

375
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,990
there's the yin yield.
>> There's the head.

376
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
>> There's the head.
 

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:15:03,430

[laughter] So, right that it's just like

382
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
[laughter] So, right that it's just like
 

383
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,790
[laughter] So, right that it's just like
an attack. If I push, you turn it.

384
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
an attack. If I push, you turn it.
 

385
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,509
an attack. If I push, you turn it.
>> So, I pull. Yes.

386
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519

 

387
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,310

Yes.

389
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,430

So go back when I pushed cuz you had my

390
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
So go back when I pushed cuz you had my
 

391
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:36,650
So go back when I pushed cuz you had my
balance. That's when you yielded. Good.

392
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:36,660

 

393
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,110

[snorts] Turn it.

394
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
[snorts] Turn it.
 

395
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,710

Lower it. So stick. Stick. And if you go
 

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,069

here, you'll lower it. Good. And then

400
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
here, you'll lower it. Good. And then
 

401
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,670
here, you'll lower it. Good. And then
I'm pushing. And you push.

I'm pushing. And you push.
 

403
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,069
I'm pushing. And you push.
You have to resist the urge to push back

404
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
You have to resist the urge to push back
 

405
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,189
You have to resist the urge to push back
on me.

406

407
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,430

Turn it. You can always step if you

408
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
Turn it. You can always step if you
 

409
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,749

Good. There's the push.
Well, that set us back up. Do you see?

414
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
Well, that set us back up. Do you see?
 

415
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:21,030
Well, that set us back up. Do you see?
You always have to spiral rotate.

416
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040

 

417
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,910

not pulling back on it?

424
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:34,956

>> I'm just pulling.
 

433
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,230
>> I'm just pulling.
>> Yeah. You're just pulling on. So what

434

>> Yeah. You're just pulling on. So what
 

435
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,629
>> Yeah. You're just pulling on. So what
you watch watch what I do. Look how

436
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
you watch watch what I do. Look how
 

437
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,629
you watch watch what I do. Look how
you're pulling there. Got it.

438
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
you're pulling there. Got it.
 

439
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,189

>> Right. So as you go to pull, this goes
 

453
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,829

there. Then we're changing.

454

455
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,029

So I go to pull

00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
So I go to pull
 

457
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,150
So I go to pull
outward spiral. There it is. And here it

458
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
outward spiral. There it is. And here it
 

459

outward spiral. There it is. And here it
is right here. Do you see?

460

is right here. Do you see?
 

461
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,710
is right here. Do you see?
>> See the turn

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
let's push push really hard on this
 

827
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,950
let's push push really hard on this
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is

828
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is
 

829
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,310
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is
now in a yin phase.

830
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320

 

831
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,710

I don't know why. And I don't care why.

832
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
I don't know why. And I don't care why.
 

833
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,870
I don't know why. And I don't care why.
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.

834
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.
 

835
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,909
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.
We'll get there again. Okay. And now

836
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
We'll get there again. Okay. And now
 

837
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,310
We'll get there again. Okay. And now
lift up really high on that hand. And

838
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
lift up really high on that hand. And
 

839
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,310
lift up really high on that hand. And
your instinct is to shove down here. But

840
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
your instinct is to shove down here. But
 

841
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,230
your instinct is to shove down here. But
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So,

842
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So,
 

843
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,029
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So,
you already know that. So when you feel

844
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
you already know that. So when you feel
 

845
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,269
you already know that. So when you feel
the the force in your own body

846
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
the the force in your own body
 

847
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,669
the the force in your own body
stop and you go to the other hand it

848
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:39,679
stop and you go to the other hand it
 

849
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,669
stop and you go to the other hand it
will be in the yin phase. Okay.

850
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
will be in the yin phase. Okay.
 

851
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,149
will be in the yin phase. Okay.
>> Okay. If you can't feel it you should be

852
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
>> Okay. If you can't feel it you should be
 

853
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,230
>> Okay. If you can't feel it you should be
able to feel it but if you can't feel it

854
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
able to feel it but if you can't feel it
 

855
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,310
able to feel it but if you can't feel it
you can cosmogonically

856
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
you can cosmogonically
 

857
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,310
you can cosmogonically
map it that she's she's pulling you. Do

858
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
map it that she's she's pulling you. Do
 

859
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,870
map it that she's she's pulling you. Do
you get that? And you try to do

860
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
you get that? And you try to do
 

861
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,269
you get that? And you try to do
something on one hand but now you left

862
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
something on one hand but now you left
 

863
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,470
something on one hand but now you left
that hand dead. Do do you you're you're

864
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
that hand dead. Do do you you're you're
 

865
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,710
that hand dead. Do do you you're you're
being cosmogonically mapped. So as you

866
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
being cosmogonically mapped. So as you
 

867
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,029
being cosmogonically mapped. So as you
did something with one hand, that hand

868
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
did something with one hand, that hand
 

869
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,149
did something with one hand, that hand
went yong and this hand went yin.

870
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
went yong and this hand went yin.
 

871
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,070
went yong and this hand went yin.
So you didn't do anything with it.

872
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
So you didn't do anything with it.
 

873
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,389
So you didn't do anything with it.
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always

874
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always
 

875
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,149
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always
doing something with the two hands

876
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
doing something with the two hands
 

877
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,990
doing something with the two hands
together. Always doing something.

878
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000

 

879
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,149

Don't get f focused. Usually what

880
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
Don't get f focused. Usually what
 

881
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,149
Don't get f focused. Usually what
happens is she pulls and you feel one of

882
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
happens is she pulls and you feel one of
 

883
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,669
happens is she pulls and you feel one of
them's ticking your balance more than

884
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
them's ticking your balance more than
 

885
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,750
them's ticking your balance more than
the other one. So that's the one that

886
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
the other one. So that's the one that
 

887
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,389
the other one. So that's the one that
you focus on. And this hand went dead.

888
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
you focus on. And this hand went dead.
 

889
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,789
you focus on. And this hand went dead.
>> So she's going, you can see how this

890
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
>> So she's going, you can see how this
 

891
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,549
>> So she's going, you can see how this
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?

892
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?
 

893
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,710
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity

894
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity
 

895
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,630
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity
being taken that way. Okay. So again,

896
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:40,640
being taken that way. Okay. So again,
 

897
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,070
being taken that way. Okay. So again,
that's only a problem if you're not

898
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
that's only a problem if you're not
 

899
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,750
that's only a problem if you're not
grounding because if you are grounding,

900
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
grounding because if you are grounding,
 

901
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,669
grounding because if you are grounding,
go ahead. My line of gravity never

902
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
go ahead. My line of gravity never
 

903
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,950
go ahead. My line of gravity never
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,

904
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,
 

905
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,630
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,
then you this is where your attention

906
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
then you this is where your attention
 

907
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,590
then you this is where your attention
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.

908
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.
 

909
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,350
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.
It's like she didn't even have anything

910
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
It's like she didn't even have anything
 

911
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,190
It's like she didn't even have anything
on the other hand because she was being

912
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,200
on the other hand because she was being
 

913
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,190
on the other hand because she was being
cosmogonically mapped and she

914
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
cosmogonically mapped and she
 

915
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,190
cosmogonically mapped and she
overemphasized one hand gave me the

916
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
overemphasized one hand gave me the
 

917
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,110
overemphasized one hand gave me the
other hand. Okay. But if you're

918
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
other hand. Okay. But if you're
 

919
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,870
other hand. Okay. But if you're
grounding it's a moot point got there.

920
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
grounding it's a moot point got there.
 

921
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,630
grounding it's a moot point got there.
So we'll use you again. Okay. So you're

922
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
So we'll use you again. Okay. So you're
 

923
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,830
So we'll use you again. Okay. So you're
you're uh going here and that's where

924
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
you're uh going here and that's where
 

925
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,149
you're uh going here and that's where
you felt that. Do you see that?

926
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
you felt that. Do you see that?
 

927
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,350
you felt that. Do you see that?
>> It's it's this relationship that's in

928
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
>> It's it's this relationship that's in
 

929
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,389
>> It's it's this relationship that's in
the yongface. Do you got it? So is she

930
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
the yongface. Do you got it? So is she
 

931
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,350
the yongface. Do you got it? So is she
as she's here when I go here do you see

932
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
as she's here when I go here do you see
 

933
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,470
as she's here when I go here do you see
it's not in a young face.

934
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
it's not in a young face.
 

935
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:45,669
it's not in a young face.
So come back

936
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679

 

937
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,190

the other thing you can do is with your

938
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
the other thing you can do is with your
 

939
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,190
the other thing you can do is with your
body. Okay. So you you got here like

940
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
body. Okay. So you you got here like
 

941
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,070
body. Okay. So you you got here like
that and then you're pulling that out.

942
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
that and then you're pulling that out.
 

943
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,269
that and then you're pulling that out.
Do you see that? Okay. So the reason

944
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
Do you see that? Okay. So the reason
 

945
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,590
Do you see that? Okay. So the reason
that you're pulling that out is because

946
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
that you're pulling that out is because
 

947
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,149
that you're pulling that out is because
it's relationship to your center. My

948
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
it's relationship to your center. My
 

949
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,549
it's relationship to your center. My
center is on the is on the other side

950
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
center is on the is on the other side
 

951
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,269
center is on the is on the other side
and the active qua

952
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
and the active qua
 

953
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,070
and the active qua
can't get to push on there. So you can

954
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
can't get to push on there. So you can
 

955
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,310
can't get to push on there. So you can
get it to where you want it to be. And

956
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
get it to where you want it to be. And
 

957
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,230
get it to where you want it to be. And
look how I shifted weight. Do you see

958
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
look how I shifted weight. Do you see
 

959
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,350
look how I shifted weight. Do you see
that? Okay. And now my body's not

960
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
that? Okay. And now my body's not
 

961
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,149
that? Okay. And now my body's not
pulling it on the outer deltoid.

962
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
pulling it on the outer deltoid.
 

963
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,149
pulling it on the outer deltoid.
>> So you're you're over here and you're

964
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
>> So you're you're over here and you're
 

965
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,310
>> So you're you're over here and you're
trying to pull it across.

966
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
trying to pull it across.
 

967
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,029
trying to pull it across.
>> I yan move the other side and then you

968
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:27,039
>> I yan move the other side and then you
 

969
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,350
>> I yan move the other side and then you
rotate the qua

970
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
rotate the qua
 

971
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,350
rotate the qua
and it goes

972
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
and it goes
 

973
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,950
and it goes
yin again. Okay. So the hands are yin

974
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
yin again. Okay. So the hands are yin
 

975
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,509
yin again. Okay. So the hands are yin
and yang to each other. The hand is yin

976
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519
and yang to each other. The hand is yin
 

977
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,230
and yang to each other. The hand is yin
and yang to each other. And the hand is

978
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,240
and yang to each other. And the hand is
 

979
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,029
and yang to each other. And the hand is

985
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,669
not important, but Marshi, you want to
always think about that. Um, let's say

986
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
always think about that. Um, let's say
 

987
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,669
always think about that. Um, let's say
she's in that in this stance. Do you see

988
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
she's in that in this stance. Do you see
 

989
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,870
she's in that in this stance. Do you see
she's in Ihan, me? Uh, if you take her

990
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
she's in Ihan, me? Uh, if you take her
 

991
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,269
she's in Ihan, me? Uh, if you take her
to this to this way, she'll always be

992
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
to this to this way, she'll always be
 

993
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,310
to this to this way, she'll always be
able to step into that. Do you see? If

994
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320
able to step into that. Do you see? If
 

995
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,110
able to step into that. Do you see? If
you take her the other way, then you get

996
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
you take her the other way, then you get
 

997
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,870
you take her the other way, then you get
her outside that edge. She has that

998
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
her outside that edge. She has that
 

999
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,269
