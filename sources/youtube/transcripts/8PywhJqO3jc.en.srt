00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:08,842
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,136
I'm standing in front of the Aikido Headquarters this morning

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,597
and we're getting ready to celebrate the new year.

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:20,187
The Kagamibiraki ceremony is also the occasion to learn about the new promotions to the subsequent Dan grade,

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,942
Ueshiba Moriteru Doshu will be awarding some of these promotions himself during the ceremony

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,152
and he will follow it up by a short demonstration.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,530
Afterwards, we'll all be meeting

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,448
to celebrate the New Year and these promotions

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,953
while enjoying some sake and some mochi cake, the traditional rice cake.

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,122
Kagamibiraki literally means: "opening the mirror"

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,084
and this is either represented by the cracking pen of a cask of sake,

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,420
or by the braking of the traditional mochi cake.

13
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,548
Symbolically, it means that

14
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,467
people would look at themselves through this mochi cake,

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,136
and reflect on the year that has past.

16
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,431
The tradition comes originally from the Tokugawa era

17
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,434
where they used to crack open a cask of sake

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,562
before battle for luck,

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,689
which subsequently became a tradition.

20
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,650
So I'll give you a little tour of the Hombu Dojo

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,570
and I'll explain to you what's going to happen during this ceremony.
