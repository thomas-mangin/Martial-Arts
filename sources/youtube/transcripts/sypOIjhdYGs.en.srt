so this is Part B of the last drill okay

486
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:50,580
so this is Part B of the last drill okay
 

487
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,440
so this is Part B of the last drill okay
because on this one on the part a I was

488

because on this one on the part a I was
 

489
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,460
because on this one on the part a I was
just doing this part do you pay

490
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,470
just doing this part do you pay
 

491
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,909
just doing this part do you pay

moving him back can you see that yes
 

555
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,610
moving him back can you see that yes
yeah okay so why is it important that I

556
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:10,620
yeah okay so why is it important that I
 

557
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,250
yeah okay so why is it important that I
have the check on this Center obviously

558
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,260
have the check on this Center obviously
 

559
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,270
have the check on this Center obviously
I'm afraid even the kana logic was

560
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm afraid even the kana logic was
 

561
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,419
I'm afraid even the kana logic was
bandaged he's got to uncheck himself but

562
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:20,429
bandaged he's got to uncheck himself but
 

563
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:23,240
bandaged he's got to uncheck himself but
I'm also setting up the ski there has to

564
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,250
I'm also setting up the ski there has to
 

565
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,690
I'm also setting up the ski there has to
be some resistance to the ski if he's

566
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:26,700
be some resistance to the ski if he's
 

567
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,930
be some resistance to the ski if he's
fighting it backwards for example

568
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:28,940
fighting it backwards for example
 

569
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,960
fighting it backwards for example
there's no see if he's coming forward

570
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:32,970
there's no see if he's coming forward
 

571
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,070
there's no see if he's coming forward
for a moment

572
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
for a moment
 

573
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,450
for a moment
Barsky you see that so every time you do

574
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:38,460
Barsky you see that so every time you do
 

575
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,580
Barsky you see that so every time you do
a ski you can't be happening your

576
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:40,590
a ski you can't be happening your
 

577
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,500
a ski you can't be happening your
opponent free they must be checked in

578
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,510
opponent free they must be checked in
 

579
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,590
opponent free they must be checked in
such a way that it adds the necessary

580
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:48,600
such a way that it adds the necessary
 

581
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,350
such a way that it adds the necessary
distance to the penetrated element of

582
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
distance to the penetrated element of
 

583
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,980
distance to the penetrated element of
the ski okay so this looks like it works

584
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:54,990
the ski okay so this looks like it works
 

585
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,769
the ski okay so this looks like it works
but it doesn't work as he just rides it

586
00:27:59,769 --> 00:27:59,779
but it doesn't work as he just rides it
 

587
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:04,039
but it doesn't work as he just rides it
so we're going to see now you're going

588
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:04,049
so we're going to see now you're going
 

589
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,360
so we're going to see now you're going
to feel what this shift okay

resistance boom on Phillip with the
 

601
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:34,310
resistance boom on Phillip with the
young of my technique so my hand will

602
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,320
young of my technique so my hand will
 

603
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,029
young of my technique so my hand will
end up over here into the other young

604
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:38,039
end up over here into the other young
 

605
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:58,800
end up over here into the other young
face on my brain

606
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:58,810

 

607
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,500

some common mistakes is you duck you're

608
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,510
some common mistakes is you duck you're
 

609
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,880
some common mistakes is you duck you're
not doing what we're saying

not doing what we're saying
 

611
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,970
not doing what we're saying
so the technique contact go wrong with

612
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:08,980
so the technique contact go wrong with
 

613
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,990
so the technique contact go wrong with
push into his center then projector

614
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
push into his center then projector
 

615
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,790
push into his center then projector
that's the technique contact go around

616
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:18,800
that's the technique contact go around
 

617
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,330
that's the technique contact go around
in push in dead center

618
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:22,340
in push in dead center
 

619
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,230

what we do instead is there's no center
 

623
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,210
what we do instead is there's no center
here and now I have to use the young

624
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,220
here and now I have to use the young
 

625
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,350
here and now I have to use the young
face against the young face and this is

626
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,360

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,590

the transition from yin to yan should

638
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:04,600
the transition from yin to yan should
 

639
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,800
the transition from yin to yan should
feel effortless otherwise its young

640
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:07,810
feel effortless otherwise its young
 

641
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:12,600
