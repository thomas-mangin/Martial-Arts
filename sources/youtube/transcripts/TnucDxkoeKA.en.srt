you about what Shaga is and and um kind
of some of the understandings I came to

30
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
of some of the understandings I came to
 

31
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,590
of some of the understandings I came to
with shag and and what I think it's

32
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,600
with shag and and what I think it's
 

33
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,150
with shag and and what I think it's
actually doing so I think shag is

34
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
actually doing so I think shag is
 

35
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,310
actually doing so I think shag is
basically born of suto moari it's

36
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,320
basically born of suto moari it's
 

37
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,190
basically born of suto moari it's
particularly fond of suto moari from

38
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,200
particularly fond of suto moari from
 

39
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,630
particularly fond of suto moari from
katate Dori and you should always think

40
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,640
katate Dori and you should always think
 

41
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,830
katate Dori and you should always think
of it initially as hoki right and so

42
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:50,840
of it initially as hoki right and so
 

43
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,990
of it initially as hoki right and so
that's that's where I think the the root

44
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,000
that's that's where I think the the root
 

45
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,709
that's that's where I think the the root
of the Shag is and and then everything

46
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
of the Shag is and and then everything
 

47
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,910
of the Shag is and and then everything
else can be borne off of that and

48
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,920
else can be borne off of that and
 

49
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,229
else can be borne off of that and
there's lots of other ways we can get at

50
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
there's lots of other ways we can get at
 

51
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,310
there's lots of other ways we can get at
it you know we can get it from the

52
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,320
it you know we can get it from the
 

53
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,430
it you know we can get it from the
shuchi and get at it from all kinds of

54
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
shuchi and get at it from all kinds of
 

55
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,630
shuchi and get at it from all kinds of
stuff right okay so let's look at katori

56
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
stuff right okay so let's look at katori
 

57
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,550
stuff right okay so let's look at katori
right okay so I have katatori now the

58
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
right okay so I have katatori now the
 

59
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,390
right okay so I have katatori now the
uraza Shag I believe is much more native

60
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
uraza Shag I believe is much more native
 

61
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,070
uraza Shag I believe is much more native
than the otaza Shag although there's

62
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080
than the otaza Shag although there's
 

63
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,910
than the otaza Shag although there's
good reason for both of them but let's

64
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:14,920
good reason for both of them but let's
 

65
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,830
good reason for both of them but let's
just look at the basic idea of Tino and

66
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:16,840
just look at the basic idea of Tino and
 

67
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,469
just look at the basic idea of Tino and
first I'll do it like you see in in a

68
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
first I'll do it like you see in in a
 

69
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,670
first I'll do it like you see in in a
lot of schools so

70
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
lot of schools so
 

71
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,350
lot of schools so
koho which is this boom that's the real

72
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,360
koho which is this boom that's the real
 

73
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,469
koho which is this boom that's the real
classic uh description of uh that now

74
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
classic uh description of uh that now
 

75
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,950
classic uh description of uh that now
why would I want to do that well I mean

76
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:27,960
why would I want to do that well I mean
 

77
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,950
why would I want to do that well I mean
there's lots of reasons I could do it

78
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
there's lots of reasons I could do it
 

79
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,069
there's lots of reasons I could do it
but if I'm not working on this hand I'm

80
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
but if I'm not working on this hand I'm
 

81
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,870
but if I'm not working on this hand I'm
really not doing myself a a service so

82
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:33,880
really not doing myself a a service so
 

83
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,789
really not doing myself a a service so
really I believe that technique should

84
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:35,799
really I believe that technique should
 

85
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,789
really I believe that technique should
often be shown a little more like this

86
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:37,799
often be shown a little more like this
 

87
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,190
often be shown a little more like this
right so see I'm popping free so all I

88
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
right so see I'm popping free so all I
 

89
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,270
right so see I'm popping free so all I
do is make a slight adjustment here boom

90
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,280
do is make a slight adjustment here boom
 

91
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,149
do is make a slight adjustment here boom
and I pop free okay now a problem that I

92
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:45,159
and I pop free okay now a problem that I
 

93
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,270
and I pop free okay now a problem that I
could have with that is as I go to do

94
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
could have with that is as I go to do
 

95
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,350
could have with that is as I go to do
that he stays stuck to me okay so what

96
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
that he stays stuck to me okay so what
 

97
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,910
that he stays stuck to me okay so what
do I do when he stays stuck to me of

98
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:50,920
do I do when he stays stuck to me of
 

99
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,109
do I do when he stays stuck to me of
course I could transition into other

100
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,119
course I could transition into other
 

101
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,350
course I could transition into other
techniques right so like triangle or

102
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
techniques right so like triangle or
 

103
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,990
techniques right so like triangle or
anything else so I come here he comes

104
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,000
anything else so I come here he comes
 

105
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,389
anything else so I come here he comes
around and boom I could try and get free

106
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
around and boom I could try and get free
 

107
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,990
around and boom I could try and get free
with a triangle or something but

108
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,000
with a triangle or something but
 

109
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,510
with a triangle or something but
continuing to turn is a really natural

110
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
continuing to turn is a really natural
 

111
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,590
continuing to turn is a really natural
thing to do and I see my kids do it all

112
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
thing to do and I see my kids do it all
 

113
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,550
thing to do and I see my kids do it all
the time my kids actually set up shag

114
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,560
the time my kids actually set up shag
 

115
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,709
the time my kids actually set up shag
rather a lot when we do hoki stuff

116
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:07,719
rather a lot when we do hoki stuff
 

117
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,589
rather a lot when we do hoki stuff
because they just like to turn and turn

118
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
because they just like to turn and turn
 

119
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,869
because they just like to turn and turn
and turn and turn turn right so if I

120
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:11,879
and turn and turn turn right so if I
 

121
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,830
and turn and turn turn right so if I
turn here and Josh keeps holding on to

122
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
turn here and Josh keeps holding on to
 

123
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,390
turn here and Josh keeps holding on to
me continuing to turn is a really really

124
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
me continuing to turn is a really really
 

125
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,270
me continuing to turn is a really really
natural thing now if we think that we

126
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
natural thing now if we think that we
 

127
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,509
natural thing now if we think that we
have to get into that final position

128
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:21,519
have to get into that final position
 

129
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:22,949
have to get into that final position
right so the position where Josh is like

130
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
right so the position where Josh is like
 

131
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,150
right so the position where Josh is like
this which some schools call nanako

132
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,160
this which some schools call nanako
 

133
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,110
this which some schools call nanako
right so up in this kind of contorted

134
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
right so up in this kind of contorted
 

135
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,229
right so up in this kind of contorted
position where you're you're pulling the

136
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
position where you're you're pulling the
 

137
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,550
position where you're you're pulling the
shoulder out of place um

138
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
shoulder out of place um
 

139
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,509
shoulder out of place um
if we think that it has to end in that

140
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,519
if we think that it has to end in that
 

141
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,190
if we think that it has to end in that
then we're going to have real difficulty

142
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
then we're going to have real difficulty
 

143
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,470
then we're going to have real difficulty
with our shag and the reason is because

144
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
with our shag and the reason is because
 

145
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,750
with our shag and the reason is because
to make that timing work off work out

146
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:38,760
to make that timing work off work out
 

147
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,470
to make that timing work off work out
meaning I set up in my mind like I want

148
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
meaning I set up in my mind like I want
 

149
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,509
meaning I set up in my mind like I want
to get a shag right and so to get the

150
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
to get a shag right and so to get the
 

151
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,350
to get a shag right and so to get the
Shag this is what I have to do we're

152
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
Shag this is what I have to do we're
 

153
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,390
Shag this is what I have to do we're
very very often not going to get it

154
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,400
very very often not going to get it
 

155
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,869
very very often not going to get it
because it's a lot of time for him to

156
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:49,879
because it's a lot of time for him to
 

157
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,750
because it's a lot of time for him to
decide to do something else right so

158
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
decide to do something else right so
 

159
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,149
decide to do something else right so
meaning that I'm like okay I'm going to

160
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,159
meaning that I'm like okay I'm going to
 

161

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
he decides to do some other right
 

165
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,110
he decides to do some other right

00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,120
let go of me and come around and grab me
 

167
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,270
let go of me and come around and grab me
he could do all kind of right so like

168
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
he could do all kind of right so like
 

169
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,270
he could do all kind of right so like
let's say Josh is doing shag and I feel

170
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
let's say Josh is doing shag and I feel
 

171
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,470
let's say Josh is doing shag and I feel
oh he's setting me up for shag well I'm

172
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
oh he's setting me up for shag well I'm
 

173
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,949
oh he's setting me up for shag well I'm
going to do this right all kinds of

174
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
going to do this right all kinds of
 

175
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,550
going to do this right all kinds of
things okay but if my whole idea of the

176
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
things okay but if my whole idea of the
 

177
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,630
things okay but if my whole idea of the
Shion is I want to get this hand free

178
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
Shion is I want to get this hand free
 

179
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,509
Shion is I want to get this hand free
and he thinks he's thwarting Me by

180
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
and he thinks he's thwarting Me by
 

181
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,309
and he thinks he's thwarting Me by
keeping a hold of my hand well I'll keep

182
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,319
keeping a hold of my hand well I'll keep
 

183
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,949
keeping a hold of my hand well I'll keep
entering entering entering he'll keep

184
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
entering entering entering he'll keep
 

185
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,550
entering entering entering he'll keep
sticking sticking sticking what happens

186
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
sticking sticking sticking what happens
 

187
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,869
sticking sticking sticking what happens
is he gets shag and he gets shag really

188
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:21,879
is he gets shag and he gets shag really
 

189
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,149
is he gets shag and he gets shag really
really naturally okay so that I believe

190
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:25,159
really naturally okay so that I believe
 

191
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,270
really naturally okay so that I believe
is the the most natural root of shag so

192
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,280
is the the most natural root of shag so
 

193
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,429
is the the most natural root of shag so
if I wanted to just give you what the

194
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:29,439
if I wanted to just give you what the
 

195
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,350
if I wanted to just give you what the
root of is that's what I'd give you so

196
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
root of is that's what I'd give you so
 

197
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,949
root of is that's what I'd give you so
that's where we started now tons of

198
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
that's where we started now tons of
 

199
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,110
that's where we started now tons of
stuff can happen because of that route

200
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
stuff can happen because of that route
 

201
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,550
stuff can happen because of that route
right so one thing we can get out of

202
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
right so one thing we can get out of
 

203
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,949
right so one thing we can get out of
this is

204
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959
this is
 

205
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,309
this is
sha and I'll show you a classic way

206
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
sha and I'll show you a classic way
 

207
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,830
sha and I'll show you a classic way
that's shown in dto to you if I can if I

208
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
that's shown in dto to you if I can if I
 

209
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,949
that's shown in dto to you if I can if I
can end up getting Josh to do it we'll

210
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
can end up getting Josh to do it we'll
 

211
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,390
can end up getting Josh to do it we'll
see okay so I come 90 so this is the

212
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,400
see okay so I come 90 so this is the
 

213
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,190
see okay so I come 90 so this is the
setup for our Ulta and then I apply this

214
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
setup for our Ulta and then I apply this
 

215
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,830
setup for our Ulta and then I apply this
to Josh let's see if I can get it is he

216
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
to Josh let's see if I can get it is he
 

217
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,990
to Josh let's see if I can get it is he
going to do it there we go we got him

218
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
going to do it there we go we got him
 

219
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,110
going to do it there we go we got him
right and we see that sh nag right okay

220
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,120
right and we see that sh nag right okay
 

221
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,030
right and we see that sh nag right okay
so that is you know and when you see it

222
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,040
so that is you know and when you see it
 

223
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,190
so that is you know and when you see it
in like a d demonstration so do mul you

224
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
in like a d demonstration so do mul you
 

225
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,550
in like a d demonstration so do mul you
see

226
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,560

 

227
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,309

this right it's like you know they

228
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
this right it's like you know they
 

229
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,390
this right it's like you know they
really like to play it out but that's

230
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
really like to play it out but that's
 

231
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,190
really like to play it out but that's
basically the idea I'm cranking the crap

232
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200
basically the idea I'm cranking the crap
 

233
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,030
basically the idea I'm cranking the crap
out of his arm because I'm cranking it

234
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,040
out of his arm because I'm cranking it
 

235
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,270
out of his arm because I'm cranking it
so hard he just starts turning in the

236
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
so hard he just starts turning in the
 

237
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,390
so hard he just starts turning in the
Shag right and so he does essentially

238
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
Shag right and so he does essentially
 

239
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,270
Shag right and so he does essentially
the same thing that I was doing I just

240
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
the same thing that I was doing I just
 

241
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,070
the same thing that I was doing I just
wanted to turn before to keep a hold of

242
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,080
wanted to turn before to keep a hold of
 

243
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,189
wanted to turn before to keep a hold of
him but now because I'm turning him so

244
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
him but now because I'm turning him so
 

245
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,790
him but now because I'm turning him so
hard he's turning all on his own right

246
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:27,800
hard he's turning all on his own right
 

247
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,550
hard he's turning all on his own right
so look at him turn all on his own bang

248
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,560
so look at him turn all on his own bang
 

249
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,230
so look at him turn all on his own bang
okay

250
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
okay
 

251
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,670
okay
now that sets up a myriad of ideas for

252
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:32,680
now that sets up a myriad of ideas for
 

253
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,029
now that sets up a myriad of ideas for
the ult right and so my favorite way to

254
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:35,039
the ult right and so my favorite way to
 

255
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,310
the ult right and so my favorite way to
show the ult is we go here and I come

256
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,320
show the ult is we go here and I come
 

257
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,629
show the ult is we go here and I come
into here to try and get hoki this way

258
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:39,639
into here to try and get hoki this way
 

259
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,830
into here to try and get hoki this way
right so this is basically a roio now as

260
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
right so this is basically a roio now as
 

261
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,990
right so this is basically a roio now as
I try to get this he pulls his arm in

262
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
I try to get this he pulls his arm in
 

263
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,510
I try to get this he pulls his arm in
really hard right so he's strong like

264
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
really hard right so he's strong like
 

265
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,710
really hard right so he's strong like
this and as he pulls that arm in I just

266
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,720
this and as he pulls that arm in I just
 

267
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,150
this and as he pulls that arm in I just
turn with it bang and we get the omoa

268
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
turn with it bang and we get the omoa
 

269
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,270
turn with it bang and we get the omoa
shagi out of that right so because he's

270
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,280
shagi out of that right so because he's
 

271
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,510
shagi out of that right so because he's
interrupted my cycle of trying to crank

272
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,520
interrupted my cycle of trying to crank
 

273
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,950
interrupted my cycle of trying to crank
that arm him pulling in to stop that

274
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
that arm him pulling in to stop that
 

275
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,590
that arm him pulling in to stop that
cycle actually facilitates me turning

276
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
cycle actually facilitates me turning
 

277
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,310
cycle actually facilitates me turning
with it to make the Shag again all right

278
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
with it to make the Shag again all right
 

279
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,510
with it to make the Shag again all right
now we're just talking about core shag

280
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
now we're just talking about core shag
 

281
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,550
now we're just talking about core shag
and what shag should have in it I think

282
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
and what shag should have in it I think
 

283
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,990
and what shag should have in it I think
one of the the most core ideas to Shag

284
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,000
one of the the most core ideas to Shag
 

285
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,350
one of the the most core ideas to Shag
that everyone forgets is that you should

286
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
that everyone forgets is that you should
 

287
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,870
that everyone forgets is that you should
be separating the body from the hand

288
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
be separating the body from the hand
 

289
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,510
be separating the body from the hand
like that right okay now if we're

290
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,520
like that right okay now if we're
 

291
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,189
like that right okay now if we're
worried about him holding on to me

292
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:18,199
worried about him holding on to me
 

293
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,950
worried about him holding on to me
because I want to turn and and make the

294
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
because I want to turn and and make the
 

295
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,230
because I want to turn and and make the
picturesque Shion I'm not going to get

296
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,240
picturesque Shion I'm not going to get
 

297
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,469
picturesque Shion I'm not going to get
that very often which leads to a lot of

298
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
that very often which leads to a lot of
 

299
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,390
that very often which leads to a lot of
bad shagas so that's why you see stuff

300
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
bad shagas so that's why you see stuff
 

301
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,270
bad shagas so that's why you see stuff
like

302
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
like
 

303
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,790
like
this right these is a really bad example

304
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:29,800
this right these is a really bad example
 

305
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,870
this right these is a really bad example
of shag instead of stuff like this right

306
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:33,880
of shag instead of stuff like this right
 

307
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,270
of shag instead of stuff like this right
to turn now Josh and Maya can tell you

308
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,280
to turn now Josh and Maya can tell you
 

309
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,390
to turn now Josh and Maya can tell you
they've had my shag before it feels like

310
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
they've had my shag before it feels like
 

311
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,830
they've had my shag before it feels like
your arm's going to get ripped out of

312
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
your arm's going to get ripped out of
 

313
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,350
your arm's going to get ripped out of
socket right and I think if I did it as

314
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
socket right and I think if I did it as
 

315
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,150
socket right and I think if I did it as
hard as I could I might very well rip an

316
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,160
hard as I could I might very well rip an
 

317
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,990
hard as I could I might very well rip an
arm out of socket right because I'm

318
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,000
arm out of socket right because I'm
 

319
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,150
arm out of socket right because I'm
separating that arm as much as I can and

320
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,160
separating that arm as much as I can and
 

321
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,870
separating that arm as much as I can and
this is what leads to the really nice

322
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
this is what leads to the really nice
 

323
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,510
this is what leads to the really nice
balance breaking right so the kazushi

324
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
balance breaking right so the kazushi
 

325
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,350
balance breaking right so the kazushi
that you want your shag is because of

326
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,360
that you want your shag is because of
 

327
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,629
that you want your shag is because of
that extreme extension now if I'm super

328
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
that extreme extension now if I'm super
 

329
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,550
that extreme extension now if I'm super
locked on the idea of I've got a turn

330
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
locked on the idea of I've got a turn
 

331
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,670
locked on the idea of I've got a turn
I'm going to put more into my turning

332
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm going to put more into my turning
 

333
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,629
I'm going to put more into my turning
fast to try try get sh and put myself in

334
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
fast to try try get sh and put myself in
 

335
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,670
fast to try try get sh and put myself in
a weak position then if I'm just want to

336
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:02,680
a weak position then if I'm just want to
 

337
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,590
a weak position then if I'm just want to
clear my hand right so if I just want to

338
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:04,600
clear my hand right so if I just want to
 

339
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,830
clear my hand right so if I just want to
clear my hand probably what's going to

340
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
clear my hand probably what's going to
 

341
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,070
clear my hand probably what's going to
happen 90% of the time is that right

342
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
happen 90% of the time is that right
 

343
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,390
happen 90% of the time is that right
which is a better technique for me

344
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
which is a better technique for me
 

345
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,749
which is a better technique for me
because it's less involved for me comes

346
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:10,759
because it's less involved for me comes
 

347
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,870
because it's less involved for me comes
off quicker less for him to do with it

348
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
off quicker less for him to do with it
 

349
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,070
off quicker less for him to do with it
than if I try to get the Shag and only

350
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,080
than if I try to get the Shag and only
 

351
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,350
than if I try to get the Shag and only
if the UK is so flexible and fast that

352
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
if the UK is so flexible and fast that
 

353
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,469
if the UK is so flexible and fast that
he can stick with me will that naturally

354
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:19,479
he can stick with me will that naturally
 

355
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,710
he can stick with me will that naturally
arise right so that's another reason

356
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
arise right so that's another reason
 

357
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,950
arise right so that's another reason
that we would get into that that shag

358
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:23,960
that we would get into that that shag
 

359
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,629
that we would get into that that shag
okay another big problem you see with

360
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:25,639
okay another big problem you see with
 

361
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,589
okay another big problem you see with
shag is people love to end side by side

362
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:28,599
shag is people love to end side by side
 

363
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,749
shag is people love to end side by side
I think it seems cool to them or it's

364
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:30,759
I think it seems cool to them or it's
 

365
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,909
I think it seems cool to them or it's
what they pictured in their head or

366
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
what they pictured in their head or
 

367
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,469
what they pictured in their head or
whatever but so they turn shag and we

368
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
whatever but so they turn shag and we
 

369
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,589
whatever but so they turn shag and we
end up in this position okay this

370
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:36,599
end up in this position okay this
 

371
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,430
end up in this position okay this
position sucks because Josh can turn

372
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
position sucks because Josh can turn
 

373
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,790
position sucks because Josh can turn
right towards me right so he can hit me

374
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
right towards me right so he can hit me
 

375
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,309
right towards me right so he can hit me
he can stab me he can kick me all kinds

376
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
he can stab me he can kick me all kinds
 

377
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,909
he can stab me he can kick me all kinds
of stuff real bad for me I want to

378
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
of stuff real bad for me I want to
 

379
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,710
of stuff real bad for me I want to
finish my shag here this is where I want

380
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,720
finish my shag here this is where I want
 

381
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,430
finish my shag here this is where I want
to be now if Josh tries to hit me kick

382
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
to be now if Josh tries to hit me kick
 

383
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,710
to be now if Josh tries to hit me kick
me bite me whatever he tries to do it

384
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
me bite me whatever he tries to do it
 

385
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,230
me bite me whatever he tries to do it
doesn't matter because I'm clearly

386
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
doesn't matter because I'm clearly
 

387
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,710
doesn't matter because I'm clearly
behind him so it's real hard for him to

388
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:51,720
behind him so it's real hard for him to
 

389
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,790
behind him so it's real hard for him to
do anything this also makes available to

390
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,800
do anything this also makes available to
 

391
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,629
do anything this also makes available to
me a nasty kodish up here and that kotay

392
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
me a nasty kodish up here and that kotay
 

393
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,950
me a nasty kodish up here and that kotay
can disarm him so if I was trying to

394
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:57,960
can disarm him so if I was trying to
 

395
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,070
can disarm him so if I was trying to
take a weapon out of his hand I can

396
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,080
take a weapon out of his hand I can
 

397
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,589
take a weapon out of his hand I can
disarm him really well with that and if

398
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:00,599
disarm him really well with that and if
 

399
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,309
disarm him really well with that and if
he's holding on to me real securely I

400
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
he's holding on to me real securely I
 

401
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,469
he's holding on to me real securely I
can wrench my hand out really really

402
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
can wrench my hand out really really
 

403
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,629
can wrench my hand out really really
strongly with that kot so only when I

404
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
strongly with that kot so only when I
 

405
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,510
strongly with that kot so only when I
get a really stable position like that

406
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
get a really stable position like that
 

407
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,869
get a really stable position like that
do I get a true kodish setup inside and

408
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:10,879
do I get a true kodish setup inside and
 

409
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,790
do I get a true kodish setup inside and
that's sometimes called Ten Kai kodish

410
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
that's sometimes called Ten Kai kodish
 

411
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,430
that's sometimes called Ten Kai kodish
in some schools of iido where I'm

412
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,440
in some schools of iido where I'm
 

413
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,390
in some schools of iido where I'm
getting a so tenai means kind of like

414
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
getting a so tenai means kind of like
 

415
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,390
getting a so tenai means kind of like
kiten same kind of thing where I'm going

416
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
kiten same kind of thing where I'm going
 

417
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,309
kiten same kind of thing where I'm going
around up high and I'm twisting that

418
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
around up high and I'm twisting that
 

419
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,350
around up high and I'm twisting that
that kod sometimes it's called Ten Kai

420
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,360
that kod sometimes it's called Ten Kai
 

421
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,029
that kod sometimes it's called Ten Kai
koday but again everything's facilitated

422
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:26,039
koday but again everything's facilitated
 

423
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,990
koday but again everything's facilitated
because of the Turning action and not

424
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,000
because of the Turning action and not
 

425
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,909
because of the Turning action and not
because of my desire to throw him with

426
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
because of my desire to throw him with
 

427
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,110
because of my desire to throw him with
this action and so what we tend to

428
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
this action and so what we tend to
 

429
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,589
this action and so what we tend to
confuse in our head is this is Shag and

430
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
confuse in our head is this is Shag and
 

431
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,270
confuse in our head is this is Shag and
it's really not the turn is Shag whether

432
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,280
it's really not the turn is Shag whether
 

433
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,990
it's really not the turn is Shag whether
he's turning because I'm cranking on him

434
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
he's turning because I'm cranking on him
 

435
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,510
he's turning because I'm cranking on him
so much or because he's pulling me back

436
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,520
so much or because he's pulling me back
 

437
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,270
so much or because he's pulling me back
and I'm going to get pulled off balance

438
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
and I'm going to get pulled off balance
 

439
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,749
and I'm going to get pulled off balance
or because I'm just trying to make a

440
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
or because I'm just trying to make a
 

441
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,710
or because I'm just trying to make a
suto moari action and he's sticking to

442
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:47,720
suto moari action and he's sticking to
 

443
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,909
suto moari action and he's sticking to
me it's always the four directions I

444
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:50,919
me it's always the four directions I
 

445
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,950
me it's always the four directions I
look at that create shag so shag is not

446
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:53,960
look at that create shag so shag is not
 

447
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,469
look at that create shag so shag is not
this shag is the position or whatever

448
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
this shag is the position or whatever
 

449
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,350
this shag is the position or whatever
happens from me turning like this and

450
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,360
happens from me turning like this and
 

451
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,029
happens from me turning like this and
that generally will lead to so if you

452
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,039
that generally will lead to so if you
 

453
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,270
that generally will lead to so if you
think of it more as good hoki instead of

454
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,280
think of it more as good hoki instead of
 

455
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,029
think of it more as good hoki instead of
a big throw you're going to get your

456
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:04,039
a big throw you're going to get your
 

457
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,230
a big throw you're going to get your
Shag in live practice way more and also

458
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,240
Shag in live practice way more and also
 

459
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,790
Shag in live practice way more and also
the techniqu is going to facilitate and

460
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
the techniqu is going to facilitate and
 

461
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,550
the techniqu is going to facilitate and
make much more sense to you as you

462
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
make much more sense to you as you
 

463
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,070
make much more sense to you as you
practice it that way right so meaning

464
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
practice it that way right so meaning
 

465
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,629
practice it that way right so meaning
that the technique will give you what

466
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:13,639
that the technique will give you what
 

467
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,710
that the technique will give you what
you want more often as hoki than it will

468
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
