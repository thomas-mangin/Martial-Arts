1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,510

all right so

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
all right so
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,550
all right so
count four

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560

 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,669

some points though

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679

 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,470

the form they form

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
the form they form
 

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,630
the form they form
is about good form it's not about

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
is about good form it's not about
 

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,750
is about good form it's not about
doing the set

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760

 

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,630

it's about doing each move correctly

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640

 

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,470

so an analogy would be

16
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
so an analogy would be
 

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,110
so an analogy would be
it's closer to figure skating than it is

18
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
it's closer to figure skating than it is
 

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,510
it's closer to figure skating than it is
to speed skating

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
to speed skating
 

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,910
to speed skating
it's not important how fast you get the

22
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
it's not important how fast you get the
 

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,510
it's not important how fast you get the
damn form done

24
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
damn form done
 

25
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,670
damn form done
it's how well you do it and key here

26
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
it's how well you do it and key here
 

27
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,709
it's how well you do it and key here
is the foot maneuver so you can micro

28
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
is the foot maneuver so you can micro
 

29
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,190
is the foot maneuver so you can micro
drill

30
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
drill
 

31
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,229
drill
the form is a drill we can micro drill

32
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
the form is a drill we can micro drill
 

33
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,270
the form is a drill we can micro drill
the form so the foot maneuver is we

34
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
the form so the foot maneuver is we
 

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,189
the form so the foot maneuver is we
we have videos on it we have the

36
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
we have videos on it we have the
 

37
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,630
we have videos on it we have the
umiyashi video

38
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
umiyashi video
 

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,869
umiyashi video
and in the uh tenkai video

40
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and in the uh tenkai video
 

41
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,869
and in the uh tenkai video
which is you're just doing that over and

42
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
which is you're just doing that over and
 

43
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,390
which is you're just doing that over and
over so

44
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
over so
 

45
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,149
over so
take the foot change the ground vector

46
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
take the foot change the ground vector
 

47
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,190
take the foot change the ground vector
go to the young phase turn your body on

48
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
go to the young phase turn your body on
 

49
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,030
go to the young phase turn your body on
that single pivot point

50
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
that single pivot point
 

51
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,870
that single pivot point
and you're just doing that over and over

52
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
and you're just doing that over and over
 

53
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,590
and you're just doing that over and over
so the micro drill for the form

54
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
so the micro drill for the form
 

55
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,550
so the micro drill for the form
which is serry sensei used to do is

56
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
which is serry sensei used to do is
 

57
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,630
which is serry sensei used to do is
imagine a line

58
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
imagine a line
 

59
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,630
imagine a line
or use a line slide across

60
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
or use a line slide across
 

61
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,990
or use a line slide across
shift your weight turn pull the foot

62
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
shift your weight turn pull the foot
 

63
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,789
shift your weight turn pull the foot
across

64
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
across
 

65
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,149
across
and you're just doing that repeatedly

66
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159

 

67
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,670

same thing don't turn the foot

68
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
same thing don't turn the foot
 

69
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,069
same thing don't turn the foot
the foot goes straight or you can test

70
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
the foot goes straight or you can test
 

71
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,630
the foot goes straight or you can test
yourself even more and the foot goes out

72
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
yourself even more and the foot goes out
 

73
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,069
yourself even more and the foot goes out
foot goes out and you turn straight

74
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
foot goes out and you turn straight
 

75
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,469
foot goes out and you turn straight
burn straight turn

76
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479

 

77
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,190

that is basically the eight counts of

78
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
that is basically the eight counts of
 

79
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,350
that is basically the eight counts of
okay

80
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360

 

81
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,190

second point

82
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200

 

83
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,229

the form like anything

84
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
the form like anything
 

85
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,910
the form like anything
can be done badly so

86
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
can be done badly so
 

87
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,390
can be done badly so
one way is you're not doing that foot

88
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
one way is you're not doing that foot
 

89
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,750
one way is you're not doing that foot
maneuver

90
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
maneuver
 

91
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,589
maneuver
second way is

92
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599

 

93
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,229

it's not martial it's not authentic it

94
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
it's not martial it's not authentic it
 

95
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,110
it's not martial it's not authentic it
has no

96
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
has no
 

97
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,630
has no
organizational integrity so

98
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
organizational integrity so
 

99
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,430
organizational integrity so
you're kind of just going like this

100
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440

 

101
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,430

take that ski for example

102
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440

 

103
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,190

it's it's like a massage it might as

104
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
it's it's like a massage it might as
 

105
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,229
it's it's like a massage it might as
well be

106
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
well be
 

107
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,509
well be
okay so we've done things to test

108
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
okay so we've done things to test
 

109
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,949
okay so we've done things to test
for it

110
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
for it
 

111
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,830
for it
i please hold on the end if i do

112
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

113
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,949

nothing the weapon comes back at me

114
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
nothing the weapon comes back at me
 

115
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,030
nothing the weapon comes back at me
you see the ski has to go forward

116
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
you see the ski has to go forward
 

117
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,070
you see the ski has to go forward
and through and project

118
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
and through and project
 

119
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,229
and through and project
it is projecting because i'm ground

120
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
it is projecting because i'm ground
 

121
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,670
it is projecting because i'm ground
vectoring

122
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
vectoring
 

123
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,190
vectoring
it's not projecting because i'm using my

124
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
it's not projecting because i'm using my
 

125
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,550
it's not projecting because i'm using my
momentum

126
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
momentum
 

127
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,110
momentum
and throwing myself do you get it

128
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
and throwing myself do you get it
 

129
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,309
and throwing myself do you get it
so doing

130
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
so doing
 

131
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,830
so doing
making this person move like that

132
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
making this person move like that
 

133
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,190
making this person move like that
is as bad a form as that

134
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
is as bad a form as that
 

135
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,750
is as bad a form as that
there's no coq projection

136
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760

 

137
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,589

okay and again you you don't need the

138
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
okay and again you you don't need the
 

139
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,710
okay and again you you don't need the
base

140
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
base
 

141
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,270
base
i just need the ground vector and you

142
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
i just need the ground vector and you
 

143
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,270
i just need the ground vector and you
can get it going yeah i just bounced off

144
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
can get it going yeah i just bounced off
 

145
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,910
can get it going yeah i just bounced off
it

146
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
it
 

147
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,229
it
here we go here we go

148
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239

 

149
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,429

okay so when i do the form now

150
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
okay so when i do the form now
 

151
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,270
okay so when i do the form now
when i go back it doesn't have to be

152
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
when i go back it doesn't have to be
 

153
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,789
when i go back it doesn't have to be
so staccato either so

154
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
so staccato either so
 

155
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,309
so staccato either so
drop and then

156
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319

 

157
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,550

you get it so the first mistake is

158
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
you get it so the first mistake is
 

159
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,629
you get it so the first mistake is
you're slurring your speech too much

160
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639

 

161
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,590

the second one is you're talking like a

162
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
the second one is you're talking like a
 

163
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,830
the second one is you're talking like a
robot

164
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840

 

165
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,909

okay

166
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919

 

167
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,670

keep the form but keep it dynamic

168
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
keep the form but keep it dynamic
 

169
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:44,550
keep the form but keep it dynamic
but don't race okay so i do each move

170
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560

 

171
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,629

every time do the around

172
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
every time do the around
 

173
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,070
every time do the around
too long too long a pause it's going to

174
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
too long too long a pause it's going to
 

175
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,670
too long too long a pause it's going to
keep going

176
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
keep going
 

177
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,710
keep going
okay i'm kind of like that cadence

178
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
okay i'm kind of like that cadence
 

179

too slow okay

184
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800

pace
 

189
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,710
pace
is too fast because you're not ground

190
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
is too fast because you're not ground
 

191
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,230
is too fast because you're not ground

192
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
vectoring
 

193
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,670
vectoring
and i find you're too staccato your pace

194
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
and i find you're too staccato your pace
 

195
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,350
and i find you're too staccato your pace

hold the weapon where it's comfortable
 

385
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,069
hold the weapon where it's comfortable
and that's the angle for the cuts

386
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
and that's the angle for the cuts
 

387
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,829
and that's the angle for the cuts
you don't need to keep opening your

388
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
you don't need to keep opening your
 

389
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,790
you don't need to keep opening your
grips and closing your grips over it's

grips and closing your grips over it's
 

391
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,829
grips and closing your grips over it's

telling you something
you're fighting the weapon okay

394
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
you're fighting the weapon okay
 

395
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,790
you're fighting the weapon okay
next point there is someone getting in

396
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
next point there is someone getting in
 

397
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,269
next point there is someone getting in
it

398
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279

 

399
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,590

and this is a cool cue development

400
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
and this is a cool cue development
 

401
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,829
and this is a cool cue development
but not if you finish it cut early

402
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
but not if you finish it cut early
 

403
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,389
but not if you finish it cut early
okay this has to come

404
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
okay this has to come
 

405
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,310
okay this has to come
down to my center and i have to task

406
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
down to my center and i have to task
 

407
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,470
down to my center and i have to task
myself without letting the

408
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
myself without letting the
 

409
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,990
myself without letting the
tip drop the tip drops because there's

410
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
tip drop the tip drops because there's
 

411
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,590
tip drop the tip drops because there's
no percussiveness at the bottom of that

412
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
no percussiveness at the bottom of that
 

413
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,470
no percussiveness at the bottom of that

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
coccu
 

415
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,629
coccu
exercise so you're just swinging the

416
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
exercise so you're just swinging the
 

417
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,910

sword
 

419
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,590
sword
or you're stopping it

420
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600

 

421
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,710

it's gonna drop boom and there's gonna

422
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
it's gonna drop boom and there's gonna
 

423
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,590
it's gonna drop boom and there's gonna
be a flex

424
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
be a flex
 

425
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,790
be a flex
when my hand hits

426
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
when my hand hits
 

427
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,310
when my hand hits
the bottom

428
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320

 

429
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,590

hits so it hits the tsuka and it stops

430
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
hits so it hits the tsuka and it stops
 

431
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,590
hits so it hits the tsuka and it stops
the tip from dropping because the tsuka

432
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
the tip from dropping because the tsuka
 

433
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,030
the tip from dropping because the tsuka
can't come up

434
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
can't come up
 

435
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,030
can't come up
and you'll see little shakes in the

436
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
and you'll see little shakes in the
 

437
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,030
and you'll see little shakes in the
weapon

438
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
weapon
 

439
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,310
weapon
don't fake the shakes you see that hand

440
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
don't fake the shakes you see that hand
 

441
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,910
don't fake the shakes you see that hand
was moving up and down

442
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
was moving up and down
 

443
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,870
was moving up and down
but the sword wants to rotate in the cup

444
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
but the sword wants to rotate in the cup
 

445
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,870
but the sword wants to rotate in the cup
it wants to rotate in the cut

446
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
it wants to rotate in the cut
 

447
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,269
it wants to rotate in the cut
and so the tsuka wants to lift then it

448
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
and so the tsuka wants to lift then it
 

449
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,790
and so the tsuka wants to lift then it
hits that

450
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
hits that
 

451
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,250
hits that
mass

452
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,260
mass
 

453
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,389

00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399

 

455
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,629

and that doesn't change in the technique

456
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
and that doesn't change in the technique
 

457
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,590
and that doesn't change in the technique
i'm moving around

458
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
i'm moving around
 

459
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,069
i'm moving around
same thing not i move around

460
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079

 

461
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,710

465
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,710

okay so the cut will finish parallel

466
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
okay so the cut will finish parallel
 

467
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,150
okay so the cut will finish parallel
the suka won't come up and it

468
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
the suka won't come up and it
 

469
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,670
the suka won't come up and it
hits my tantan at the tsuka level

470
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
hits my tantan at the tsuka level
 

471
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,710
hits my tantan at the tsuka level
okay not up here

472
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
okay not up here
 

473
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,870
okay not up here
and maybe i get a little

474
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
and maybe i get a little
 

475
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,910
and maybe i get a little
reverb going okay let's try two halfway

476
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
reverb going okay let's try two halfway
 

477
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,430
reverb going okay let's try two halfway
points

478
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
points
 

479
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,790
points
so the breathing

480
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800

 

481
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,069

how do i get to the bottom so at this

482
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
how do i get to the bottom so at this
 

483
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,030
how do i get to the bottom so at this
point i'm letting everything relax

484
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
point i'm letting everything relax
 

485
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,949
point i'm letting everything relax
otherwise i can't flex

486
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
otherwise i can't flex
 

487
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,870
otherwise i can't flex
if everything is flexed there's no flex

488
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
if everything is flexed there's no flex
 

489
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,910
if everything is flexed there's no flex
at the bottom everything has to relax

490
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
at the bottom everything has to relax
 

491
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,189
at the bottom everything has to relax
so everything is relaxed and i do this

492
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
so everything is relaxed and i do this
 

493
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:57,590
so everything is relaxed and i do this
too

494
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
too
 

495
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,150
too
not just with my musculature

496
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160

 

497
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,230

but also with my breath so you open

498
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
but also with my breath so you open
 

499
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,150
but also with my breath so you open
release your throat

500
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160

 

501
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,110

that's flex it's flexing tartan

502
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120

 

503
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,110

flex the entire time

504
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120

 

505
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,030

so same thing brown

506
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040

 

507
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,310

next thing i

508
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
next thing i
 

509
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,230
next thing i
again it's just

510
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240

 

511
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,590

change the vector rotate

512
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
change the vector rotate
 

513
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,550
change the vector rotate
single point pivot this is the form this

514
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
single point pivot this is the form this
 

515
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,350
single point pivot this is the form this
is the form

516
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
is the form
 

517
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,430
is the form
that's all we're doing so my tendency

518
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
that's all we're doing so my tendency
 

519
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,870
that's all we're doing so my tendency
is as i come around

520
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
is as i come around
 

521
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,509
is as i come around
home

522
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519

 

523
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,670

you can if you want you come around

524
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
you can if you want you come around
 

525
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,310
you can if you want you come around
and steps that's not really the form

526
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
and steps that's not really the form
 

527
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,870
and steps that's not really the form
it's just another step you did and now

528
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
it's just another step you did and now
 

529
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,870
it's just another step you did and now
you're gonna start the

530
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
you're gonna start the
 

531
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,389
