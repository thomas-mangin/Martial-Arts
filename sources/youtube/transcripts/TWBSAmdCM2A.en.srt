00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,470

There's around nine or 10 of us in the

28
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
There's around nine or 10 of us in the
 

29
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,350
There's around nine or 10 of us in the
world who were awarded the five uh

certifications by
 

33
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,350
certifications by
cytoensing and I think there might be

34
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
cytoensing and I think there might be
 

35
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,590
cytoensing and I think there might be
other teachers who give out certificates

36
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
other teachers who give out certificates
 

37
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,710
other teachers who give out certificates

form to me and then when you send me the
 

105
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,229
form to me and then when you send me the
first film,

106
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
first film,
 

107
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,710
first film,
uh you you make it the film, you put it

108
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720

110
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
on YouTube or some device where you can
 

111
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,030
on YouTube or some device where you can
send me the link so I can view it, but

112
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
send me the link so I can view it, but
 

113
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,830
send me the link so I can view it, but
you review it yourself. Now, if it was

114
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:04,840
you review it yourself. Now, if it was
 

115
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,630
you review it yourself. Now, if it was
YouTube, I go into settings and I set it

116
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:09,640
YouTube, I go into settings and I set it
 

117
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,550
YouTube, I go into settings and I set it
for

118
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:11,560
for
 

119
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,949
for
25. It's the slowest of the slow. You

120
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
25. It's the slowest of the slow. You
 

121
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,270
25. It's the slowest of the slow. You
can go slower than that, but I look at

122
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
can go slower than that, but I look at
 

123
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,350
can go slower than that, but I look at
it frame by frame so that I can stop it

124
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
it frame by frame so that I can stop it
 

125
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,670
it frame by frame so that I can stop it
at the point that I see it where there's

126
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
at the point that I see it where there's
 

127
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,750
at the point that I see it where there's
an error.

128
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
an error.
 

129
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,790
an error.
So, I urge you to do the same because

130
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:28,800
So, I urge you to do the same because
 

131
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,270
So, I urge you to do the same because
there's a lot of points that you will

132
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
there's a lot of points that you will
 

133
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,229
there's a lot of points that you will
perhaps see, save you sending me in a

134
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
perhaps see, save you sending me in a
 

135
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,509
perhaps see, save you sending me in a
film just for me to correct what you'll

141
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,229
yourself. At the point of sending me the
form and the first film, you then

142
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
form and the first film, you then
 

143
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,070
