00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,950

he says progressions okay so skill set

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:04,960
he says progressions okay so skill set
 

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,389
he says progressions okay so skill set
one he's

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
one he's
 

5

okay

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
okay
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,390
okay
so he's not just standing there holding

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
so he's not just standing there holding
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,790

my shoulder he is trying to displace
 

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,670
my shoulder he is trying to displace
so i have to take that into the ground

14
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
so i have to take that into the ground
 

15
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,029
so i have to take that into the ground
i'm going to do this yield

16
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
i'm going to do this yield
 

17
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,910
i'm going to do this yield
and then the projection

18
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
and then the projection
 

19
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,710
and then the projection
so i'm not going to fall back and he's

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
so i'm not going to fall back and he's
 

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,710
so i'm not going to fall back and he's
not going to stay there and not push

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
not going to stay there and not push
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,910
not going to stay there and not push
okay he's trying to knock me down i

24
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
okay he's trying to knock me down i
 

25
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,389
okay he's trying to knock me down i
yield this way

26
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399

 

27
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:57,189

don't worry about anything else

28
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199

 

29

okay
 

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,750
okay
drill two

32
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
drill two
 

33
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,869
drill two
so he's doing the same thing

34
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
so he's doing the same thing
 

35
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,750
so he's doing the same thing
i'm going to do my ashi sabaki to get

36
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
i'm going to do my ashi sabaki to get
 

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,350
i'm going to do my ashi sabaki to get
that to balance out

38
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360

 

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,750

to balance out where the front inward

40
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
to balance out where the front inward
 

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,590
to balance out where the front inward
kazushi is

42
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
kazushi is
 

43
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,990
kazushi is
not just balance out you get it so

44
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
not just balance out you get it so
 

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,950
not just balance out you get it so
balance out he's pushing on me

46
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
balance out he's pushing on me
 

47
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,550
balance out he's pushing on me
stay there stay there

48
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560

 

49
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,630

that balanced out but that's not the

50
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
that balanced out but that's not the
 

51
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,469
that balanced out but that's not the
front end requisition

52
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
front end requisition
 

53
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,710
front end requisition
so i have to he pushes i yield and away

54
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
so i have to he pushes i yield and away
 

55
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,950
so i have to he pushes i yield and away
there's the front inward position he's

56
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
there's the front inward position he's
 

57
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:49,990
there's the front inward position he's
pushing i yield in away

58
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000

 

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,389

you're not balancing it out

60
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
you're not balancing it out
 

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,190
you're not balancing it out
and then pushing him back that's not it

62
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
and then pushing him back that's not it
 

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,190
and then pushing him back that's not it
around

64
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200

 

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,709

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239

 

73
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,510

if you're here and you stop the guy

74
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
if you're here and you stop the guy
 

75

00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
ready to go then he doesn't really come
 

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,470
ready to go then he doesn't really come
in all that much do you think

80
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
in all that much do you think
 

81
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,589
in all that much do you think
he's here

82

he's here
 

83
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,990
he's here
and he should have been here when i did

84
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
and he should have been here when i did
 

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,350
and he should have been here when i did
the projection

86
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
the projection
 

87
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,750
the projection
okay so one helpful hint is you don't

88
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
okay so one helpful hint is you don't
 

89
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,110
okay so one helpful hint is you don't
realize it but you did not uh bring it

90
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
realize it but you did not uh bring it
 

91
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,430
realize it but you did not uh bring it
to neutral zero

92
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
to neutral zero
 

93
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,710
to neutral zero
right away so you went

94
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
right away so you went
 

95
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,110
right away so you went
you you tried to make this value higher

96
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
you you tried to make this value higher
 

97
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,350
you you tried to make this value higher
and then you're like oh okay and you

98
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
and then you're like oh okay and you
 

99
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,990
and then you're like oh okay and you
basically stopped him from coming in

100
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
basically stopped him from coming in
 

101
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,910
basically stopped him from coming in
so helpful hit

102
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
so helpful hit
 

103
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,830
so helpful hit
is

104
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
is
 

105
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,830
is
not

not
 

107
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,270
not
always as he goes and reaches for it

108
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
always as he goes and reaches for it
 

109
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,070
always as he goes and reaches for it
he'll do that half inch to one inch

110
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
he'll do that half inch to one inch
 

111
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,830
he'll do that half inch to one inch
um

112
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

do you see because he's trying to get it

116
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
do you see because he's trying to get it
 

117
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,550
do you see because he's trying to get it
okay now of course you can't we're not

118
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
okay now of course you can't we're not

going like this
 

121
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,589
going like this
because then it doesn't make him want to

technique
is it's going in his center

140
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
is it's going in his center
 

141

176
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
to
 

177
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,949
to
so i can't go that way okay then i'll

178
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
so i can't go that way okay then i'll
 

179
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,949
so i can't go that way okay then i'll
come this way right

180
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959

 

181
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,789

but here i am going that way i'm going

182
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
but here i am going that way i'm going
 

183
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,470
but here i am going that way i'm going
to the outside always go to the outside

184
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
to the outside always go to the outside
 

185
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,830
to the outside always go to the outside
you can go to the outside but some of

186
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
you can go to the outside but some of
 

187
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,830
you can go to the outside but some of
you are like

188
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
you are like
 

189
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,670
you are like
this and you went in the inside and then

190
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
this and you went in the inside and then
 

191
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,150
this and you went in the inside and then
you went on the outside

192
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160

 

193
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,510

you're like inside outside that's a no

194
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
you're like inside outside that's a no
 

195
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,590
you're like inside outside that's a no
doubt

196
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600

 

197
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,230

so everything moves to the outside right

198
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
so everything moves to the outside right
 

199
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,150
so everything moves to the outside right
away

200
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
away
 

201
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,230
away
outside right away

202
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240

 

203
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,749

outside

204
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
outside
 

205
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,350
outside
you're doing that because your weight

206
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
you're doing that because your weight
 

207
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,189
you're doing that because your weight
distribution is jacked up so you have to

208
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
distribution is jacked up so you have to
 

209
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,310
distribution is jacked up so you have to
shift away to lighten the leg

210
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
shift away to lighten the leg
 

211
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,710
shift away to lighten the leg
and you're just partially ignorant shift

212
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
and you're just partially ignorant shift
 

213
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,590
and you're just partially ignorant shift
weight life in the leg okay there's

214
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
weight life in the leg okay there's
 

215
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,430
weight life in the leg okay there's
about technique but it's partially

216
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
about technique but it's partially
 

217
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,150
about technique but it's partially
ignorant okay you don't move towards the

218
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
ignorant okay you don't move towards the
 

219
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,950
ignorant okay you don't move towards the
inside even a centimeter millimeter

220
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
inside even a centimeter millimeter
 

221
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,310
inside even a centimeter millimeter
everything goes to the outside

222
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
everything goes to the outside
 

223
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,510
everything goes to the outside
immediately okay

224
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
