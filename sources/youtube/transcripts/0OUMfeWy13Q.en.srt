the shoulder so that the deltoid doesn't
 

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,509
the shoulder so that the deltoid doesn't
bite

bite
 

19
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,070
bite
and i don't have the muscle isolation i

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
and i don't have the muscle isolation i
 

21
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,630
and i don't have the muscle isolation i
can

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
can
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,550
can
kind of shake it out just to make sure

24
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
kind of shake it out just to make sure
 

25
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,150

39
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,590

taking his energy and grounding it

40
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
taking his energy and grounding it
 

41
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,630
taking his energy and grounding it
on the back foot

42
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640

 

43
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,350

you can assist the organization of your

44
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
you can assist the organization of your
 

45
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,830
you can assist the organization of your

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,830

as far as the shoulder biting and

48
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
as far as the shoulder biting and
 

49
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,270
as far as the shoulder biting and
isolating

50
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
isolating
 

51
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,990
isolating
by imagining that you're touching the

52
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
by imagining that you're touching the
 

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,870
by imagining that you're touching the
wall past

54
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880

 

55
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,630

just kind of brushing it with your

56
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
just kind of brushing it with your
 

57
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,510
just kind of brushing it with your
fingertips some people find that helpful

58
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
fingertips some people find that helpful
 

59
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,910
fingertips some people find that helpful
but it's more important that you are

60
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
but it's more important that you are
 

61
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,630
but it's more important that you are
really smashing that

62
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
really smashing that
 

63
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,149
really smashing that
foot via his thrusting into your

64
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159

 

65
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,550

there's really nothing on the front foot

66
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
there's really nothing on the front foot
 

67
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,190
there's really nothing on the front foot
just grounding the back foot

68
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200

 

69
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,270

all right let's try it it is not

70
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
all right let's try it it is not
 

71
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,230
all right let's try it it is not
necessary

72
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
necessary
 

73
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,429
necessary
so like if i if i move in here

74
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
so like if i if i move in here
 

75
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,709
so like if i if i move in here
the grounding is the same and i'm still

76
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
the grounding is the same and i'm still
 

77
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,749
the grounding is the same and i'm still
relaxing that and organizing my body

78
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
relaxing that and organizing my body
 

79
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,630
relaxing that and organizing my body
so that i don't extend i don't isolate

80
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
so that i don't extend i don't isolate
 

81
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,550
so that i don't extend i don't isolate
that deltoid

82
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
that deltoid
 

83
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,430
that deltoid
same thing if i if i move out here i'm

84
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
same thing if i if i move out here i'm
 

85
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,070
same thing if i if i move out here i'm
still doing the same thing

86
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
still doing the same thing
 

87
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,350
still doing the same thing
okay i i have to

88
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
okay i i have to
 

89
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,110
okay i i have to
consciously not let the shoulder bite

90
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
consciously not let the shoulder bite
 

91
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,630
consciously not let the shoulder bite
and isolate so i i relax everything

92
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
and isolate so i i relax everything
 

93
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,710
and isolate so i i relax everything
and i just have the back foot ground me

94
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
and i just have the back foot ground me
 

95
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,710
and i just have the back foot ground me
but you will find it easier if you

96
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
but you will find it easier if you
 

97
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,509
but you will find it easier if you
organize yourself in a more tactically

98
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
organize yourself in a more tactically
 

99
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,910
organize yourself in a more tactically
minded manner so arms in front of you

100
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
minded manner so arms in front of you
 

101
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,830
minded manner so arms in front of you
not off to the side okay

not off to the side okay
 

103
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,270
not off to the side okay
and not at all that violates

104
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
and not at all that violates
 

105
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,949
and not at all that violates
the other weapons okay so

106
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
the other weapons okay so
 

107
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,350
the other weapons okay so
it's a slight bend in the elbow

108
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
it's a slight bend in the elbow
 

109
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,270
it's a slight bend in the elbow
and the elbow is in but not so much

110
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
and the elbow is in but not so much
 

111
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,430
and the elbow is in but not so much
as you're now exposing the outer deltoid

112
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
as you're now exposing the outer deltoid
 

113
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,430
as you're now exposing the outer deltoid
to a more sophisticated

from there try these exercises
 

121
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,630
from there try these exercises

so he's helping me train for grounding

158
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
so he's helping me train for grounding
 

159
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,830
so he's helping me train for grounding
and i'm going to bend my arm

160
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
and i'm going to bend my arm
 

161
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,749
and i'm going to bend my arm
and he's going to move up the arm so

162
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
and he's going to move up the arm so
 

163
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,189
and he's going to move up the arm so
he'll push on the wrist

164

replace the hand and then he'll go to
 

167
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,749
replace the hand and then he'll go to
the elbow the slow enough so that

the elbow the slow enough so that
 

169
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,749
the elbow the slow enough so that
i can reorganize everything

170
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
i can reorganize everything
 

171
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,950
i can reorganize everything
as i need to and he'll come down
