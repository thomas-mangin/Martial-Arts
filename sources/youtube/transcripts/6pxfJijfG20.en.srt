1
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:16,368
I think it was when I was young like 19 or 20 that I joined a Chinese bujutsu association.

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:24,710
This is where I learned basics like posture, etc.

3
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,593
I learned what they call the kihon renko of Chinese bujitsu.

4
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,472
As I practiced those things, 

5
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:44,688
I realized I didn’t really like performing kata.

6
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:52,904
Then I heard of another sport that came from China called Sanda.

7
00:01:52,904 --> 00:02:08,795
It had close combat matches wearing headgear that included striking, kicking, punching, and throwing.

8
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:14,217
I didn’t have any experience at that time, 

9
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:23,226
and I got to know someone who had mastered the combat systems in the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

10
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:30,484
I learned things like striking, kicking, and throwing from him, 

11
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:36,948
but since it was personal training,

12
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:45,749
it wasn’t like the conventional training at dojo where they would learn the basics together step by step. 

13
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:52,381
We rather picked certain points and concentrated on those. 

14
00:02:52,381 --> 00:03:05,268
We also asked for volunteers to practice with us and he told me how to move as we practiced.

15
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:16,446
He was a really smart person, his training was unique and much more detailed than the conventional training,

16
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:25,872
including how to use our body, and it was good, it really helped. 

17
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:32,879
It really helped for the competitions such as Sanda.

18
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:43,098
I think it’s good to participate in competitions while you are young.

19
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:54,067
You might win or lose but it’ll be good experience anyway. 

20
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Then, there is also a koryu teacher from whom I learned a lot in terms of skills 

21
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:26,683
and regarding the establishment of Aunkai. 

22
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:35,108
He had mastered taijutsu and kenjutsu from his school but now that I think of it, 

23
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:46,036
he didn’t have a training manual per se like basic training, kata, kumiuchi, and then taijin.

24
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:57,214
But he taught me how the human body worked technically, psychologically, and biologically, and about posture,

25
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:04,638
how I should stand, things like that.

26
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:14,314
And he told me to take that home and to practice it.

27
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,610
It was like that for 10 months to a year.

28
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,530
It was indeed a short time,

29
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:33,583
but it constitutes the essence of what we do when I teach since I created the Aunkai.

30
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:58,358
And when I turned a certain age, 

31
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:13,164
I started asking myself how I would take my power and speed to the next level.

32
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:20,964
So before I turned 30, I decided to learn from a Sensei known for Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu. 

33
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:26,720
It was very helpful too,  

34
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,391
He taught me that it wasn’t about external forces 

35
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:47,908
He taught me how to be able to use internal forces rather than something external like muscles.

36
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:56,625
Those practices are reflected in Aunkai as well. 

37
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:13,016
I also learned how to use my body, more of physical technique, from masters of conventional Aikido, Daito-ryu, or Aiki. 

38
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,964
In Japanese, we say "Aun no kokyu", 

39
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,758
and some think of it as like the Yin/Yang from Chinese Taichi,

40
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:52,430
the InYo [陰陽], like in taikyoku [太極]

41
00:07:52,722 --> 00:08:00,730
But originally, "A Un" in Sanskrit means the beginning of an event and the end of it 

42
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,441
and that continues forever,

43
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:13,827
In bujutsu, if there is a beginning, there is also an end and there is this feeling that you have until the end, and the movement continues forever.

44
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,580
Through that, we create phenomena in different ways.

45
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,711
That’s how I came to name it Aun.

46
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,338
At shrines and temples also, 

47
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:30,552
there are two bodies like komainu, aun or kongo rikishi or nio statues,

48
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:38,685
there are different names for them but you see two statues in front of shrines or temples.

49
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:49,988
So deeply in the Japanese history, there is also a meaning, and I think that’s why they have those statues. 

50
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:56,786
Well of course, in the history, there is Japanese culture, and there are religious or philosophical aspects.

51
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:06,087
Having all those meanings, I think it’s a wonderful word. That’s why I named it Aunkai.

52
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:12,635
Even though Aunkai is not limited to a specific school or category,

53
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:22,937
we try to master those simply things taking into account the nature of a human body like two arms and two feet.

54
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,107
We focus on building our body, 

55
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:34,407
including conditioning it externally all over the body like muscles, bones, and so on.

56
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:41,748
Once we are done with it, we do internally. 

57
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,044
This is the most important thing and it takes a lot of time.

58
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,882
We have continuous tanren or training to develop our internal energy.

59
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,887
They call it "naiko" in Chinese bujutsu and I call it "naido".

60
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:11,296
This tanren is to deeply recognize those techniques and ideas by structuring your training yourself and working hard on it.

61
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:20,180
I think tanren is absolutely needed in bujitsu if you want to widen your teihen. 

62
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,685
And this kind of…I would say correct way of training

63
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,854
including how you breathe and move,  

64
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,816
is to learn to move your body from muscle memory, 

65
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,570
to maintain that condition when you are relaxed,

66
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:42,535
and to recognize the condition of your body when you are facing someone.

67
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,207
At Aunkai, from the beginning,

68
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,544
we have given much importance to this recognition training,

69
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,090
to recognize the condition of your body as well as that of your opponent. 

70
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:58,361
This becomes the core and it helps us develop our body 

71
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:06,911
and adapt to other ryuhas such as martial arts, taijutsu, and jujutsu.

72
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:14,002
As we turn the body, we have different applications and techniques.

73
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:18,006
We develop those skills through practice with others.

74
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:22,427
That is the kind of training we mainly do.

75
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:32,770
We don’t really use existing, conventional katas or forms but instead,

76
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:39,694
we use the logic and mechanisms 

77
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:46,451
that I learned from my past teachers as the basis of training and further analyze it as we practice. 

78
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:55,251
When doing this, the way we move gradually changes as we step up.

79
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:02,550
and in fact, the way I move and how I am on the inside are completely different from how they were when I was younger. 

80
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:09,515
This I call human experiment, human experiment using your own body.

81
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,519
I guess it’s fun and interesting to see how your body changes.

82
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,067
I think that’s one of the unique things about Aunkai. 

83
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:36,811
Most of the people who come to Aunkai have various backgrounds and practiced different ryuhas

84
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:43,609
and they may have found a limit in their previous ways of tanren or training 

85
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:50,825
and they may also have their challenges and questions as to what to choose 

86
00:15:51,033 --> 00:16:02,295
and which parts to learn more deeply.

87
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:07,300
I reflect on those things when I teach.  

88
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:12,430
Well ultimately it’s what humans do.

89
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,309
I guess tradition is very important.

90
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,105
But I guess in the process of learning, 

91
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:29,030
we may go through changes and find or notice new things.

92
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:39,123
Those kinds of things, I get to verify through teaching using my body and telling people.

93
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:46,005
That kind of free style or thinking I guess is the most interesting thing about Aunkai,

94
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,550
and I think that kind of thinking is very unique to Aunkai. 

95
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:54,680
Conventionally, they have predetermined paths. 

96
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,559
But at Aunkai, there are different kinds of people to begin with, 

97
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,144
like foreigners.

98
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,480
As I also teach different things abroad, 

99
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,611
I deal with people from different cultures and races, with different ways of thinking.

100
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,489
But when they take each other’s hands,

101
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,033
well that way that’s body to body, 

102
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:21,666
I think they work hard in keiko or training regardless of language.

103
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,294
In japanese, "keiko" is like training, "renshu",

104
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,088
in English, you say "practice".

105
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,177
It can have different meanings but what I mean by keiko

106
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:39,267
is closer to what it meant in the bujutsu and budo from the time of the Samurai.

107
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,435
"Shosa" [所作, conduct] or "Saho" [作法, etiquette]

108
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:48,150
Those developed since the age of Samurai all come from the lifestyle aimed to learn those bodily movements through techniques in everyday life.

109
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:54,824
It enables you to constantly move your body logically and efficiently 

110
00:17:54,824 --> 00:18:01,080
without anything preventing and the body to function that way.

111
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,293
So keiko is something that takes into account those techniques

112
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:11,424
"Training" is usually interpreted as training your body, 

113
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:17,722
your muscles as you have weight training or something training.

114
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:29,400
And practice is to repeat, like katageiko, repeat the same thing like kata, 

115
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,654
I think that practice means to repeat those things. 

116
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:15,154
I guess that training your body is the same across sports, budo, and bujutsu,

117
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,660
but actually I think the most important thing is the way you think,

118
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,000
the way you process what happens around you and a huge amount of information.

119
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:34,173
What I mean is that we have to think actively and comprehensively 

120
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:40,221
about our nervous system and how our body works psychologically and biologically. 

121
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,934
The reason is that as we do training continuously and repeatedly, 

122
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:55,152
sometimes we end up doing it mindlessly without knowing what is important and what is needed.

123
00:19:55,653 --> 00:20:03,369
So in training, in the process of intensely training your body,

124
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:15,214
there is a need to learn to slow down and relax your mind and body. 

125
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:27,560
Normally, people may think of training as intense training where you challenge your limit like this

126
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,854
but it's not only that,

127
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:42,158
you also need to take your time to nurture your imagination through slow, quiet training. 

128
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,582
This Aunkai way, well my way of thinking is very unique.

129
00:20:49,790 --> 00:21:03,387
And in reality, in a fight, because things keep changing, you have to be able to process information extremely fast.

130
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:14,273
Of course, to think fast is very important in that kind of situation, 

131
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,401
but in training and because it’s training, 

132
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:28,454
I think you also need to purposely slow down and to recognize the technique of creating a relation between you and your opponent.

133
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:35,127
And I think that is also the fundamental technique that we have developed in bujitsu

134
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:48,182
to avoid a fight when you face your opponent like hyoushi, ma, and timing and all that.

135
00:21:49,099 --> 00:22:00,319
That technique is like something that one learns and obtains as like another sense through hard work and time. 

136
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:13,707
And when your body and your mind match, you will be able to control and use your body as you wish. 

137
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,880
This is a very unique method of keiko at Aunkai.
