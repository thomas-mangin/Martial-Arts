00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,490

I'm Chris Brian and this week we're

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm Chris Brian and this week we're
 

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,720
I'm Chris Brian and this week we're
talking about position and the

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:17,730
talking about position and the
 

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,910
talking about position and the
importance of position in Aikido in

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
importance of position in Aikido in
 

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,650
importance of position in Aikido in
Aikido practice in the modern era we

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:21,660
Aikido practice in the modern era we
 

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,779
Aikido practice in the modern era we
really tend to put a huge emphasis on

12
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:23,789
really tend to put a huge emphasis on
 

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,200
really tend to put a huge emphasis on
technique and form I think that's a real

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,210
technique and form I think that's a real
 

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,730
technique and form I think that's a real
problem in the Aikido the way we're

16
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:28,740
problem in the Aikido the way we're
 

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,839
problem in the Aikido the way we're
doing it now and so we need to

18
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:29,849
doing it now and so we need to
 

19
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,550
doing it now and so we need to
understand that something like position

20
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560
understand that something like position
 

21
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,959
understand that something like position
is significantly more important than

22
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:32,969
is significantly more important than
 

23
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,310
is significantly more important than
technique and technique actually

24
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
technique and technique actually
 

25
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,260
technique and technique actually
facilitates better position instead of

26
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,270
facilitates better position instead of
 

27
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,790
facilitates better position instead of
the other way around I think in Aikido

28
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:37,800
the other way around I think in Aikido
 

29
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,590
the other way around I think in Aikido
we tend to think that the technique is

30
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
we tend to think that the technique is
 

31
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,270
we tend to think that the technique is
what we're trying to do and so we get to

32
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
what we're trying to do and so we get to
 

33
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,250
what we're trying to do and so we get to
a position just as you enable us to do a

34
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,260
a position just as you enable us to do a
 

35
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,900
a position just as you enable us to do a
technique but that's not true the

36
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:44,910
technique but that's not true the
 

37
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,760
technique but that's not true the
technique is what allows us to keep or

38
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:46,770
technique is what allows us to keep or
 

39
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,790
technique is what allows us to keep or
maintain a position that we're in so we

40
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:49,800
maintain a position that we're in so we
 

41
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,310
maintain a position that we're in so we
talked last video about he throw me the

42
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
talked last video about he throw me the
 

43
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,049
talked last video about he throw me the
side by side position this time we're

44
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:54,059
side by side position this time we're
 

45
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,729
side by side position this time we're
gonna talk about Edie me and what the et

46
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739
gonna talk about Edie me and what the et
 

47
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,709
gonna talk about Edie me and what the et
me position is and I get Josh over here

48
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:57,719
me position is and I get Josh over here
 

49
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,819
me position is and I get Josh over here
we're gonna go to work Josh okay so

50
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:01,829
we're gonna go to work Josh okay so
 

51
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,349
we're gonna go to work Josh okay so
we're gonna talk a little bit about the

52
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
we're gonna talk a little bit about the
 

53
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,960
we're gonna talk a little bit about the
EDB position eating any position is the

54
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:05,970
EDB position eating any position is the
 

55
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,850
EDB position eating any position is the
best position for us to have the reason

56
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:07,860
best position for us to have the reason
 

57
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,830
best position for us to have the reason
is because he has the least defense and

58
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
is because he has the least defense and
 

59
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,750
is because he has the least defense and
offensive if I have an eating me

60
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
offensive if I have an eating me
 

61
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,789
offensive if I have an eating me
position and he's probably always trying

62
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
position and he's probably always trying
 

63
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,410
position and he's probably always trying
to get eating any position on me which

64
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:15,420
to get eating any position on me which
 

65
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,880
to get eating any position on me which
is what I'm gonna have to depend from so

66
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,890
is what I'm gonna have to depend from so
 

67
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,460
is what I'm gonna have to depend from so
the best way to get out of being eating

68
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,470
the best way to get out of being eating
 

69
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,350
the best way to get out of being eating
meat is to distance now understand if

70
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
meat is to distance now understand if
 

71
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,999
meat is to distance now understand if
he's attacking me when we're falling

72
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:23,009
he's attacking me when we're falling
 

73
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,620
he's attacking me when we're falling
like yeah Aikido philosophy which is I

74
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,630
like yeah Aikido philosophy which is I
 

75
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,999
like yeah Aikido philosophy which is I
don't want to hurt this guy if he

76
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,009
don't want to hurt this guy if he
 

77
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,920
don't want to hurt this guy if he
chooses to distance that's a winner

78
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:27,930
chooses to distance that's a winner
 

79
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,899
chooses to distance that's a winner
right so the second key feels like oh

80
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
right so the second key feels like oh
 

81
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,340
right so the second key feels like oh
this guy might get et me I need to

82
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,350
this guy might get et me I need to
 

83
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,990
this guy might get et me I need to
distance that's great if he distance is

84
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
distance that's great if he distance is
 

85
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,149
distance that's great if he distance is
perfect because distancing is better for

86
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:35,159
perfect because distancing is better for
 

87
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,980
perfect because distancing is better for
me than position right so on our

88
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:36,990
me than position right so on our
 

89
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,410
me than position right so on our
strategical set of things distancing is

90
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,420
strategical set of things distancing is
 

91
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,760
strategical set of things distancing is
better than positioning right so I'd

92
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:40,770
better than positioning right so I'd
 

93
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,020
better than positioning right so I'd
rather have more distance because it's

94
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,030
rather have more distance because it's
 

95
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,160
rather have more distance because it's
harder for him to hurt me with that

96
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,170
harder for him to hurt me with that
 

97
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,530
harder for him to hurt me with that
distance so if he chooses the distance

98
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:45,540
distance so if he chooses the distance
 

99
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,950
distance so if he chooses the distance
that's fantastic if I can and he's

100
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
that's fantastic if I can and he's
 

101
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,660
that's fantastic if I can and he's
trying to get eating me on me I'm going

102
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,670
trying to get eating me on me I'm going
 

103
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,700
trying to get eating me on me I'm going
to distance right so it all just depends

104
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,710
to distance right so it all just depends
 

105
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,109
to distance right so it all just depends
on who's getting to what position first

106
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119
on who's getting to what position first
 

107
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,850
on who's getting to what position first
but if I can't make distance I'm gonna

108
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860
but if I can't make distance I'm gonna
 

109
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,620
but if I can't make distance I'm gonna
try to stick to my eating knee position

110
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,630
try to stick to my eating knee position
 

111
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,710
try to stick to my eating knee position
so eating the position is

112
00:01:59,710 --> 00:01:59,720
so eating the position is
 

113
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,750
so eating the position is
yes right so it's me coming right behind

114
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:01,760
yes right so it's me coming right behind
 

115
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
yes right so it's me coming right behind
this guy here's our eating me position

116
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:03,650
this guy here's our eating me position
 

117
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,200
this guy here's our eating me position
now the reason this position is so good

118
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,210
now the reason this position is so good
 

119
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,300
now the reason this position is so good
is because Josh could hit me as hard as

120
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,310
is because Josh could hit me as hard as
 

121
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,190
is because Josh could hit me as hard as
he wants from this position and he's

122
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
he wants from this position and he's
 

123
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,450
he wants from this position and he's
gonna have a real hard time hitting me

124
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:10,460
gonna have a real hard time hitting me
 

125
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,160
gonna have a real hard time hitting me
with any real force right so gonna be

126
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,170
with any real force right so gonna be
 

127
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,660
with any real force right so gonna be
very hard for him to hit me successfully

128
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:13,670
very hard for him to hit me successfully
 

129
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,460
very hard for him to hit me successfully
now notice what he starts to want to do

130
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:15,470
now notice what he starts to want to do
 

131
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,740
now notice what he starts to want to do
if I let him he'll turn around and hit

132
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,750
if I let him he'll turn around and hit
 

133
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,810
if I let him he'll turn around and hit
me now I don't have any me anymore so if

134
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:19,820
me now I don't have any me anymore so if
 

135
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,430
me now I don't have any me anymore so if
he's able to get to there he can hit me

136
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
he's able to get to there he can hit me
 

137
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,870
he's able to get to there he can hit me
hard but if we stay just in this

138
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:22,880
hard but if we stay just in this
 

139
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,820
hard but if we stay just in this
position he can't hit me very hard right

140
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:24,830
position he can't hit me very hard right
 

141
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,560
position he can't hit me very hard right
his kicks is everything gonna all be

142
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,570
his kicks is everything gonna all be
 

143
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,330
his kicks is everything gonna all be
kind of poor right so not a very strong

144
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,340
kind of poor right so not a very strong
 

145
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,520
kind of poor right so not a very strong
position meanwhile I can hit him and

146
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,530
position meanwhile I can hit him and
 

147
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,199
position meanwhile I can hit him and
grab him with all of my force right I

148
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,209
grab him with all of my force right I
 

149
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,030
grab him with all of my force right I
can hit him full force Amy and full fur

150
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,040
can hit him full force Amy and full fur
 

151
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,680
can hit him full force Amy and full fur
I knew everything to him full force so

152
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:35,690
I knew everything to him full force so
 

153
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,900
I knew everything to him full force so
if I got this position I'm starting to

154
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:37,910
if I got this position I'm starting to
 

155
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,150
if I got this position I'm starting to
win the position war I've won the

156
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
win the position war I've won the
 

157
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,370
win the position war I've won the
position war okay now understand again

158
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,380
position war okay now understand again
 

159
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,199
position war okay now understand again
dynamics so he's not gonna let me have

160
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,209
dynamics so he's not gonna let me have
 

161

I go up further that's fine because what

294
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
I go up further that's fine because what
 

295
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,920

he does is he starts getting more and

296
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:52,930
he does is he starts getting more and
 

297
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,330

300
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,260
is that distance so that's how we're
 

301
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,020
is that distance so that's how we're
