someone hold your hand well the reason

80
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:24,509
someone hold your hand well the reason
 

81
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,240
someone hold your hand well the reason
is I have something in my hand that I'm

82
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,250
is I have something in my hand that I'm
 

83
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,770
is I have something in my hand that I'm
gonna use on him and if he doesn't hold

84
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:27,780
gonna use on him and if he doesn't hold
 

85
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,319
gonna use on him and if he doesn't hold
my hand then he's gonna be in a bad way

86
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:30,329
my hand then he's gonna be in a bad way
 

87
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,300
my hand then he's gonna be in a bad way
right and so may some people go like oh

you're gonna punch him so he grabs your

90
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
you're gonna punch him so he grabs your
 

91
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,899
you're gonna punch him so he grabs your
wrist if you if I was gonna punch him he

92
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:35,909
wrist if you if I was gonna punch him he
 

93
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,190
wrist if you if I was gonna punch him he
could do a high cover which would work

94
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
could do a high cover which would work
 

95
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,410
could do a high cover which would work
out way better for him than it would be

96
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,420
out way better for him than it would be
 

97
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,240
out way better for him than it would be
to grab my wrist I mean it's hard to

98
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,250
to grab my wrist I mean it's hard to
 

99
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,710
to grab my wrist I mean it's hard to
grab my wrist and if I were gonna punch

100
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
grab my wrist and if I were gonna punch
 

101
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,480
grab my wrist and if I were gonna punch
Josh in just doing a high cover will

102
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,490
Josh in just doing a high cover will
 

103
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,819
Josh in just doing a high cover will
pretty much neutralize that shot and he

104
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:46,829
pretty much neutralize that shot and he
 

105
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,590
pretty much neutralize that shot and he
doesn't have to grab my hand however if

106
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
doesn't have to grab my hand however if
 

107
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
doesn't have to grab my hand however if
I have blade in my hand and he high

108
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,250
I have blade in my hand and he high
 

109
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,770
I have blade in my hand and he high
covered I'm probably going in between

110
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:51,780
covered I'm probably going in between
 

111
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,300
covered I'm probably going in between
his arm and still stabbing him in the

112
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,310
his arm and still stabbing him in the
 

113
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,069
his arm and still stabbing him in the
neck at the very least he's got a good

114
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
neck at the very least he's got a good
 

115
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,870
neck at the very least he's got a good
cut on his arm right so I can't afford

116
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
cut on his arm right so I can't afford
 

117
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,090
cut on his arm right so I can't afford
to do that so he's probably gonna defend

118
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,100
to do that so he's probably gonna defend
 

119
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,770
to do that so he's probably gonna defend
with outstretched hands and then

120
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:00,780
with outstretched hands and then
 

121
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,959
with outstretched hands and then
immediately he's gonna grab that hand if

122
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:02,969
immediately he's gonna grab that hand if
 

123
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,370
immediately he's gonna grab that hand if
he can but he wants to get a hold of

124
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,380
he can but he wants to get a hold of
 

125
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,480
he can but he wants to get a hold of
that hand so he doesn't get a hold of

126
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,490
that hand so he doesn't get a hold of
 

127
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,950
that hand so he doesn't get a hold of
that hand I'm gonna stab him with it

128
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
that hand I'm gonna stab him with it
 

129
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,550
that hand I'm gonna stab him with it
right so that's why we have

130
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:09,560
right so that's why we have
 

131
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,710
right so that's why we have
Auri techniques I am using a weapon to

132
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:11,720
Auri techniques I am using a weapon to
 

133
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,059
Auri techniques I am using a weapon to
defend myself I've been put in such a

134
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:13,069
defend myself I've been put in such a
 

135
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,470
defend myself I've been put in such a
bad position that I need to use a weapon

136
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
bad position that I need to use a weapon
 

137
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,320
bad position that I need to use a weapon
and this guy somehow to grab a hole to

138
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,330
and this guy somehow to grab a hole to
 

139
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,780
and this guy somehow to grab a hole to
my hand now people also say that's lower

140
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:19,790
my hand now people also say that's lower
 

141
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,220
my hand now people also say that's lower
percentage people aren't gonna grab your

142
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,230
percentage people aren't gonna grab your
 

143
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,940
percentage people aren't gonna grab your
hand out of the air

144
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:21,950
hand out of the air
 

145
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,220
hand out of the air
I hope it's low percentage I hope no one

146
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,230
I hope it's low percentage I hope no one
 

147
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,660
I hope it's low percentage I hope no one
can ever grab my hand out of the air

148
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,670
can ever grab my hand out of the air
 

149
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,190
can ever grab my hand out of the air
when I'm trying to stab them because I

150
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
when I'm trying to stab them because I
 

151
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,080
when I'm trying to stab them because I
need to use a knife so I hope they don't

152
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,090
need to use a knife so I hope they don't
 

153
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,000
need to use a knife so I hope they don't
get it however if they do get it I want

154
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,010
get it however if they do get it I want
 

155
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,890

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:32,900
to have techniques that help me clear
 

157
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,990
to have techniques that help me clear
the hand so that's why we have these it

158
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,000
the hand so that's why we have these it
 

159
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
the hand so that's why we have these it
doesn't matter that's low percentage its
