127
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,350
so he's
he's

128
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
he's
 

129
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,990
he's
this person he's not being attempted

130
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
this person he's not being attempted
 

131
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,670
this person he's not being attempted
anymore because he's

132
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
anymore because he's
 

133
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,229
anymore because he's

realized that
the guy's trying to fight him so the

136
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
the guy's trying to fight him so the
 

137
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,869
the guy's trying to fight him so the
technique's not working

138
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
technique's not working
 

139
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,869
technique's not working
so let's go through that okay

140
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879

 

141
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,110

so so what you're doing is you're doing

142
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
so so what you're doing is you're doing
 

143
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,990
so so what you're doing is you're doing
everything correct believe it or not

144
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
everything correct believe it or not
 

145
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
everything correct believe it or not
he's doing everything correct but what's

146
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
he's doing everything correct but what's
 

147
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,110
he's doing everything correct but what's
happening is he's dropping his shoulder

148
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
happening is he's dropping his shoulder
 

149
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,990
happening is he's dropping his shoulder
he's going soft but now he's he's

150
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
he's going soft but now he's he's
 

151
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,550
he's going soft but now he's he's
deciding to go in

152
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560

 

153
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,430

but he didn't tell me to go in

154
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
but he didn't tell me to go in
 

155
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,470
but he didn't tell me to go in
so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and

156
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and
 

157
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,229
so if i'm the puppet of the attacker and
using his strength

158
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
using his strength
 

159
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,190
using his strength
i've got to think

160
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200

 

161
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,390

are you still happy that you're

162
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
are you still happy that you're
 

163
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,309
are you still happy that you're
comfortable i'm so happy and i didn't

164
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
comfortable i'm so happy and i didn't
 

165
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,070
comfortable i'm so happy and i didn't
block you no

166
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
block you no
 

167
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,509
block you no
so i'm going to just creep this leg

251
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,110
he's done was he actually didn't
redirect his power he went into his

252
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
redirect his power he went into his
 

253
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,070
redirect his power he went into his
power so this shoulder used to go back

254
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
power so this shoulder used to go back
 

255
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,950
power so this shoulder used to go back
there

256
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
there
 

257
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,350

matching up with this arm
 

265
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,390
matching up with this arm
then i know the angle is right

266
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
then i know the angle is right
 

267
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,990

can you now see
that this line

274
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440

 

275
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,990

you can't see come close

276
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
you can't see come close
 

277
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,909
you can't see come close
this arm and this arm

278
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
this arm and this arm
 

279
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,350
this arm and this arm
is running

280
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
is running
 

281
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,189
is running
in line

282
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
in line
 

283
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,270
in line
before it wasn't

284
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
before it wasn't
 

285

so now
he can hold that tension that uh he's

288
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
he can hold that tension that uh he's
 

289
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,150
he can hold that tension that uh he's
given him you must hold that not in the
