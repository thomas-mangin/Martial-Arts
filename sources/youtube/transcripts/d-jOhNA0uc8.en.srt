1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,230

so let's go over the

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,240
so let's go over the
 

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,870
so let's go over the
three gross basic elements in

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
three gross basic elements in
 

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,950
three gross basic elements in
yesterday's technique

6
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
yesterday's technique
 

7
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,070
yesterday's technique
okay

8
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
okay
 

9
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,990
okay
obviously there was a huge internal

10
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
obviously there was a huge internal
 

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,589
obviously there was a huge internal
aspect to

12
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
aspect to
 

13
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,110
aspect to
the whole technique

14
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
the whole technique
 

15
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,430
the whole technique
and obviously you cannot separate the

16
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
and obviously you cannot separate the
 

17
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,670
and obviously you cannot separate the
elements as we're about to do

18
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
elements as we're about to do
 

19
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,630
elements as we're about to do
but it's easier to learn them

20
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
but it's easier to learn them
 

21
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,109
but it's easier to learn them
in a kind of microphone fashion

22
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
in a kind of microphone fashion
 

23
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,230
in a kind of microphone fashion
okay

24
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
okay
 

25
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,750
okay
so uh

26
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
so uh
 

27
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,349
so uh
we're going to

28
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
we're going to
 

29
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,310
we're going to
start

30
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
start
 

31
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,550
start
with this part we're going to cover this

32
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
with this part we're going to cover this
 

33
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,470
with this part we're going to cover this
part

34
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
part
 

35
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,670
part
we're

36
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
we're
 

37
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,430
we're
going to cover

38
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
going to cover
 

39
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,470
going to cover
the

40
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
the
 

41
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,030
the
yogurt part

42
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
yogurt part
 

43
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,030
yogurt part
and we're going to cover

44
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
and we're going to cover
 

45
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,430
and we're going to cover
the final pin those are the three gross

46
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
the final pin those are the three gross
 

47
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,389
the final pin those are the three gross
elements okay

48
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399

 

49
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,190

so

50
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
so
 

51
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,709
so
from here

52
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
from here
 

53
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,790
from here
open

54
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
open
 

55
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,790
open
you have a c grid there

56
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800

 

57
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,590

secret there

58
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600

 

59
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,270

and then it closes

60
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
and then it closes
 

61
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,070
and then it closes
when you close don't close the uh

62
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
when you close don't close the uh
 

63
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,590
when you close don't close the uh
index finger

64
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
index finger
 

65
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,390
index finger
and prioritize the pinky so that

66
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
and prioritize the pinky so that
 

67
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,149
and prioritize the pinky so that
the palm is your main point of

68
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
the palm is your main point of
 

69
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,390
the palm is your main point of
connection watch your fingers not your

70
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
connection watch your fingers not your
 

71
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,429
connection watch your fingers not your
grip

72
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
grip
 

73
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,310
grip
okay so it's in here that you you would

74
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
okay so it's in here that you you would
 

75
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,310
okay so it's in here that you you would
have the internal aspect

76
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
have the internal aspect
 

77
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,870
have the internal aspect
on your palm okay

78
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
on your palm okay
 

79
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,870
on your palm okay
so home

80
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880

 

81
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,670

pinky stays open

82
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
pinky stays open
 

83
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,310
pinky stays open
c

84
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320

 

85
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,830

c

86
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
c
 

87
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,510
c
then pinky

88
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
then pinky
 

89
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:45,429
then pinky
each finger palm

90
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439

 

91
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,670

okay and then

92
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
okay and then
 

93
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,910
okay and then
not in the technique but the same

94
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
not in the technique but the same
 

95
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,030
not in the technique but the same
mechanics is turn this a little bit just

96
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
mechanics is turn this a little bit just
 

97
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,789
mechanics is turn this a little bit just
turn it a little bit

98
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
turn it a little bit
 

99
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,870
turn it a little bit
and lift it a little bit

100
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
and lift it a little bit
 

101
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,190
and lift it a little bit
so that your chest can get underneath it

102
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
so that your chest can get underneath it
 

103
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,350
so that your chest can get underneath it
here

104
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360

 

105
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,830

so you're going to you're comfortable

106
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
so you're going to you're comfortable
 

107
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,429
so you're going to you're comfortable
here or you're going to turn it a little

108
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
here or you're going to turn it a little
 

109
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,350
here or you're going to turn it a little
bit more and you're going to pick it up

110
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
bit more and you're going to pick it up
 

111
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,670
bit more and you're going to pick it up
a little bit more to match your

112
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
a little bit more to match your
 

113
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,030
a little bit more to match your
chest shape

114
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040

 

115
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,110

turn a little bit more and pick up a

116
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
turn a little bit more and pick up a
 

117
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,550
turn a little bit more and pick up a
little bit more

118
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
little bit more
 

119
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,790
little bit more
and then you put your chest underneath

120
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
and then you put your chest underneath
 

121
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:35,350
and then you put your chest underneath

three common mistakes

778
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480

 

779
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,770

and
you're going to

you're going to
 

787
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,830
you're going to
pass the technique

788
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
pass the technique
 

789
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,029
pass the technique
come back around on the spiral and then

790
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
come back around on the spiral and then
 

791
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,190
come back around on the spiral and then
try to do the technique so you see how i

792
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
try to do the technique so you see how i
 

793
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,789

it's also not controlled maintenance so

800
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
it's also not controlled maintenance so
 

801
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,909

you don't
 

803
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,510
you don't
pass the technique he comes around

804
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
pass the technique he comes around
 

805
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,230
pass the technique he comes around
boom and it goes on he was going that

806
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
boom and it goes on he was going that
 

807
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,789
boom and it goes on he was going that
way it goes that way we'll do that same

808
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
way it goes that way we'll do that same
 

809

it's not going to pass it
back around and then do it

816
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
back around and then do it
 

817
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,669
back around and then do it
right when it drops in place

818
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
right when it drops in place
 

819
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,950
right when it drops in place
it goes to this control point

820
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
it goes to this control point
 

821
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,950
it goes to this control point
boom right angle

822
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
boom right angle
 

823
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,470

833
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,270
it
so you're is to settle

834
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280

839
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,430

pins do not go up

840
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440

 

841
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,230

843
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,190

that causes the third mistake

844
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
that causes the third mistake
 

845
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,930
