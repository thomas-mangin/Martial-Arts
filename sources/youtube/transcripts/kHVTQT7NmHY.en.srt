now uh and you can see some things that
 

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,069
now uh and you can see some things that
happen you pay attention because this

36
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,079
happen you pay attention because this
 

37
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,030
happen you pay attention because this
energy is being directed down you pay

energy is being directed down you pay
 

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,910
energy is being directed down you pay
attention and I'm dropping I don't know

40
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:00,920
attention and I'm dropping I don't know
 

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,990
