1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,470

okay so this you'll see a lot of this

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480

 

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,870

and um that's just like a corruption

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
and um that's just like a corruption
 

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,070
and um that's just like a corruption
of the practice like

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
of the practice like
 

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,189
of the practice like
yoga studio yoga is a corruption

8
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
yoga studio yoga is a corruption
 

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,310
yoga studio yoga is a corruption
okay i need to have

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
okay i need to have
 

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,990
okay i need to have
a single pivot point when i turn

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
a single pivot point when i turn
 

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,830
a single pivot point when i turn
anything more than that causes

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
anything more than that causes
 

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,990
anything more than that causes
instability in the turn when pressure is

16
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
instability in the turn when pressure is
 

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,990
instability in the turn when pressure is
placed upon it

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
placed upon it
 

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,430
placed upon it
so in this drill

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
so in this drill
 

21
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,709
so in this drill
he's got pressure on my two corners

22
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
he's got pressure on my two corners
 

23
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,470
he's got pressure on my two corners
okay and i'm going to

24
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
okay and i'm going to
 

25
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,790
okay and i'm going to
do a yin movement

26
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
do a yin movement
 

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,950
do a yin movement
take the turning aspect establish a

28
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
take the turning aspect establish a
 

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,630
take the turning aspect establish a
single pivot point

30
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
single pivot point
 

31
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,229
single pivot point
on my front foot

32
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
on my front foot
 

33
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,470
on my front foot
so you're going to feel a few things if

34
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
so you're going to feel a few things if
 

35
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,349
so you're going to feel a few things if
you'll if you can't get all your weight

36
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
you'll if you can't get all your weight
 

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,030
you'll if you can't get all your weight
onto the single pivot point you won't be

38
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
onto the single pivot point you won't be
 

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,789
onto the single pivot point you won't be
able to turn

40
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
able to turn
 

41
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,550
able to turn
okay so i have to get

42
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
okay so i have to get
 

43
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,270
okay so i have to get
my weight you see how i'm shifting it

44
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
my weight you see how i'm shifting it
 

45
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,149
my weight you see how i'm shifting it
forward

46
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
forward
 

47
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,270
forward
as the turn is going in essence i'm

48
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
as the turn is going in essence i'm
 

49
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,550
as the turn is going in essence i'm
going around

50
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
going around
 

51
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,109
going around
i'm going around this energy here

52
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119

 

53
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,350

this one is yielding

54
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360

 

55
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,230

so i have to shift weight on the front

56
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
so i have to shift weight on the front
 

57
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,630
so i have to shift weight on the front
foot

58
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640

 

59
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,590

and i complete the deviation

60
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
and i complete the deviation
 

61
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,749
and i complete the deviation

71
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,270

okay here can't go forward that would be

72
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
okay here can't go forward that would be
 

73
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,990
okay here can't go forward that would be
a clash

74
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
a clash
 

75
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,789
a clash
i'm going to go around it in this

76
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
i'm going to go around it in this
 

77
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,510
i'm going to go around it in this
turning

78
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
turning
 

79
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,109

81
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,389

so i am turning

00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
so i am turning
 

83
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:22,640

i'm literally it's just the
 

143
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,430
i'm literally it's just the
non-contestation of

144
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
non-contestation of
 

145
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,789
non-contestation of
jitsu so here's here's that angle

146
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
jitsu so here's here's that angle
 

147
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,430
jitsu so here's here's that angle
it's almost the opposite because to keep

148
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
it's almost the opposite because to keep
 

149
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,470
it's almost the opposite because to keep
this i have to

150
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
this i have to
 

151
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,470
this i have to
drive that into him so i have to keep

152
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
drive that into him so i have to keep
 

153
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,670
drive that into him so i have to keep
that stuck

154
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
that stuck
 

155
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,509
that stuck
what i'm trying to do is go around

156
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
what i'm trying to do is go around
 

157
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,110
what i'm trying to do is go around
around it do you see that

158
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
around it do you see that
 

159
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,670
around it do you see that
so not not into him and move him

160
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
so not not into him and move him
 

161
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,869
so not not into him and move him
uh but release release and start to go

162
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
uh but release release and start to go
 

163
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,470
uh but release release and start to go
around it

164
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
around it
 

165
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,550
around it
okay so the reason we have on the four

166
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
okay so the reason we have on the four
 

167
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,509
okay so the reason we have on the four
corners

168
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
corners
 

169
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,710

is when you have a gooey center

170
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
is when you have a gooey center
 

171
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,909
is when you have a gooey center
um you're going to realize oh that's

172
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
um you're going to realize oh that's
 

173
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,670
um you're going to realize oh that's
probably why i do that double pivot

174
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
probably why i do that double pivot
 

175
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,070

is i can't i can't turn as a unit okay

178
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
is i can't i can't turn as a unit okay

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,710
right
all right i'm just using it now

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
all right i'm just using it now
 

273
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,110

around this pressure without moving

works better under more intensity

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
works better under more intensity
 

283
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,870
works better under more intensity
so push really hard and he becomes way

284
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
so push really hard and he becomes way
 

285
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,230
so push really hard and he becomes way
more slippery push a little
