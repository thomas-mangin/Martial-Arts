00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,110
gonna do that I just came in trying to
 

63
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,870
gonna do that I just came in trying to
do our hand forward I'm gonna keep that

64
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
do our hand forward I'm gonna keep that
 

65
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:13,940

to skewer him it's going to be much

84
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,080
to skewer him it's going to be much
 

85
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,330
to skewer him it's going to be much
easier if you take that inertia it move

86
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:23,340
easier if you take that inertia it move
 

87

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,020
it over here if you're going here and
you're going back

90
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,030
you're going back
 

91
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:35,530
you're going back
you think that's human mentality so I

92
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:35,540
you think that's human mentality so I
 

93
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:46,940
you think that's human mentality so I
don't need to go back I go right and he

94
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:46,950
don't need to go back I go right and he
 

95
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:57,520
don't need to go back I go right and he
thinks that work look what was left out

96
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,530
thinks that work look what was left out

I'm not protecting the centerline and

98
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm not protecting the centerline and
 

99
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm not protecting the centerline and
pretty much anything works but the

100
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:04,710
pretty much anything works but the
 

101
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,370
pretty much anything works but the
completion of my move is not only the

102
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,380
completion of my move is not only the
 

103
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,830
completion of my move is not only the
catalyst for his move like that's the

104
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:12,840
catalyst for his move like that's the
 

105
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,170
catalyst for his move like that's the
starting point but it provides the

106
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,180
starting point but it provides the
 

107
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,620
starting point but it provides the
reason for his mood so I gotta do

108
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:18,630
reason for his mood so I gotta do
 

109
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,470
reason for his mood so I gotta do
something in a way then pretty much the

110
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,480
something in a way then pretty much the
 

111
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,230
something in a way then pretty much the
only thing he can do is what the form is

112
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
only thing he can do is what the form is
 

113
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,060
only thing he can do is what the form is
prescribed hey so I don't reverse

114
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,070
prescribed hey so I don't reverse

116
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:29,820

117
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,270

I shouldn't have to go backwards because

118
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,280
I shouldn't have to go backwards because
 

119
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,870
I shouldn't have to go backwards because
he shouldn't be able to come forward got

120
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:35,880
he shouldn't be able to come forward got
 

121
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,570
he shouldn't be able to come forward got
it and then you reverse engineer all the

122
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:38,580
it and then you reverse engineer all the
 

123
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,620
it and then you reverse engineer all the
way like if I did the first move right I

124
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:41,630
way like if I did the first move right I
 

125
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,270
way like if I did the first move right I
wouldn't be able to go backwards and if

126
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,280
wouldn't be able to go backwards and if
 

127
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,060
wouldn't be able to go backwards and if
I did the first move right that requires

128
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,070
I did the first move right that requires
 

129
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,760
I did the first move right that requires
me to go forward he wouldn't be able to

130
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:49,770
me to go forward he wouldn't be able to
 

131
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,020
me to go forward he wouldn't be able to
come forward either so I go skewer fool

132
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,030
come forward either so I go skewer fool
 

133
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,910
come forward either so I go skewer fool
I'm protecting that centerline okay if

oh this worked perfectly and we starting

146
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:17,939
oh this worked perfectly and we starting
 

147
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,289
oh this worked perfectly and we starting
to and we're starting to rotate the

148
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:21,299
to and we're starting to rotate the
 

149
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:36,620
to and we're starting to rotate the
form we're not just trading sticks this

150
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,630
form we're not just trading sticks this
 

151
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:51,930
form we're not just trading sticks this
is not the fun there's a battle logic

152
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:51,940

close very close so my body has to move

164
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,190
