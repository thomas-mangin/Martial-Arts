demonstrations and sparring so we want
to make another comparison video because

12
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:12,929
to make another comparison video because
 

13
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,450
to make another comparison video because
I think it's important to understand

14
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,460
I think it's important to understand
 

15
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,799
I think it's important to understand
that a lot of times when people see

16
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:15,809
that a lot of times when people see
 

17
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,779
that a lot of times when people see
something and they think that a martial

18
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:17,789
something and they think that a martial
 

19
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,029
something and they think that a martial
art school looks a certain way our style

20
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:20,039
art school looks a certain way our style
 

21
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,800
art school looks a certain way our style
looks a certain way it's because they're

22
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:21,810
looks a certain way it's because they're
 

23
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,840
looks a certain way it's because they're
seeing just sparring or just

24
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:23,850
seeing just sparring or just
 

25
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,970
seeing just sparring or just
demonstration or just theatrical

representation right so those three are

28
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:27,900
representation right so those three are
 

29
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,019
representation right so those three are
pretty different and so a lot of times

30
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:30,029
pretty different and so a lot of times
 

31
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,580
pretty different and so a lot of times
when you see it if you see only

32
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:31,590
when you see it if you see only
 

33
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,770
when you see it if you see only
theatrical demonstrations from someone

34
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:33,780
theatrical demonstrations from someone
 

35
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,600
theatrical demonstrations from someone
you're like whoa that guy's like a god

36
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:35,610
you're like whoa that guy's like a god
 

37
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,190
you're like whoa that guy's like a god
they're so powerful they're so amazing

38
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
they're so powerful they're so amazing
 

39
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,560
they're so powerful they're so amazing
they can do such great stuff but you've

40
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:39,570
they can do such great stuff but you've
 

41
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,240
they can do such great stuff but you've
never seen them spar which might be very

42
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,250
never seen them spar which might be very
 

43
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,910
never seen them spar which might be very
different right and also if you only see

44
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
different right and also if you only see
 

45
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,490
different right and also if you only see
sparring then you think like all that's

46
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,500
sparring then you think like all that's
 

47
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,110
sparring then you think like all that's
really crude and they don't know how to

48
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,120
really crude and they don't know how to
 

49
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,910
really crude and they don't know how to
do things they don't understand

50
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
do things they don't understand
 

51
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,529
do things they don't understand
technically how stuff works and that's

52
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:51,539
technically how stuff works and that's
 

53
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,600
technically how stuff works and that's
because sparring's high stress and and

54
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,610
because sparring's high stress and and
 

55
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,040
because sparring's high stress and and
it's a different kind of environment

56
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,050
it's a different kind of environment
 

57
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,130
it's a different kind of environment
than when you see a clean form and also

58
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,140
than when you see a clean form and also
 

59
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,689
than when you see a clean form and also
traditional forms understand what

60
00:00:59,689 --> 00:00:59,699
traditional forms understand what
 

61
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,549
traditional forms understand what
they're showing which is a clear

62
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,559
they're showing which is a clear
 

63
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,310
they're showing which is a clear
demonstration of a technique or a set of

64
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
demonstration of a technique or a set of
 

65
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,289
demonstration of a technique or a set of
ideas in the form so that you can

66
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:06,299
ideas in the form so that you can
 

67
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,000
ideas in the form so that you can
understand what's going on so all three

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,010
understand what's going on so all three
 

69
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,960
understand what's going on so all three
of those are different you know a

70
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:08,970
of those are different you know a
 

71
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,240
of those are different you know a
theatrical representations main idea is

72
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,250
theatrical representations main idea is
 

73
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,810
theatrical representations main idea is
to show you how cool something looks

74
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:13,820
to show you how cool something looks
 

75
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,310
to show you how cool something looks
forms idea is to show you how

76
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
forms idea is to show you how
 

77
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
forms idea is to show you how
technically it works and to try and

78
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,090
technically it works and to try and
 

79
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,249
technically it works and to try and
illustrate some fine points and a

80
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:21,259
illustrate some fine points and a
 

81
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:23,810
illustrate some fine points and a
sparring is actually what would happen

82
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:23,820
sparring is actually what would happen
 

83
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,210
sparring is actually what would happen
if two people engage so a lot of times

84
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:26,220
if two people engage so a lot of times
 

85
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,230
if two people engage so a lot of times
you know people looking at traditional

86
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,240
you know people looking at traditional
 

87
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,910
you know people looking at traditional
jujitsu they're all oh you know

88
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
jujitsu they're all oh you know
 

89
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
jujitsu they're all oh you know
traditional jujitsu is so much more

90
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:30,930
traditional jujitsu is so much more
 

91
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,840
traditional jujitsu is so much more
elegant than modern Brazilian Jujitsu

92
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:32,850
elegant than modern Brazilian Jujitsu
 

93
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,609
elegant than modern Brazilian Jujitsu
and the reason is because you really

94
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:34,619
and the reason is because you really
 

95
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,770
and the reason is because you really
only see demonstrations of that you

96
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:36,780
only see demonstrations of that you
 

97
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,210
only see demonstrations of that you
don't see a lot of sparring of that so

98
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:38,220
don't see a lot of sparring of that so
 

99
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,069
don't see a lot of sparring of that so
you're only either seeing a theatrical

100
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
you're only either seeing a theatrical
 

101
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,710
you're only either seeing a theatrical
representation or a demonstration of

102
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
representation or a demonstration of
 

103
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,740
representation or a demonstration of
technique like a form so so it's

104
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:45,750
technique like a form so so it's
 

105
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,940
technique like a form so so it's
important to understand the difference

106
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:46,950
important to understand the difference
 

107
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,870
important to understand the difference
between all three of those so I'm gonna

108
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
between all three of those so I'm gonna
 

109
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,340
between all three of those so I'm gonna
get Josh and my out here and we're gonna

110
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,350
get Josh and my out here and we're gonna
 

111
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,240
get Josh and my out here and we're gonna
show you the difference between those

112
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,250
show you the difference between those
 

113
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,490
show you the difference between those
three kinds of interactions with the

114
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:52,500
three kinds of interactions with the
 

115
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,660
three kinds of interactions with the
same two people

116
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:53,670
same two people
 

117
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,740
same two people

[Music]

126
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,590

 

127

[Music]

128
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319

 

129
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,979

so that is a representation of

130
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:46,989
so that is a representation of
 

131
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,720
so that is a representation of
theatrical martial arts so that looks

132
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,730
theatrical martial arts so that looks
 

133
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,490
theatrical martial arts so that looks
real cool and you can see lots of cool

134
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,500
real cool and you can see lots of cool
 

135
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,990
real cool and you can see lots of cool
techniques done in there and awesome

136
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
techniques done in there and awesome
 

137
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,640
techniques done in there and awesome
stuff was happening and then of course

138
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,650
stuff was happening and then of course
 

139
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,050
stuff was happening and then of course
you know we added some cool camera

140
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,060
you know we added some cool camera
 

141
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
you know we added some cool camera
angles and stuff which makes it look

142
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,170
angles and stuff which makes it look
 

143
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,140
angles and stuff which makes it look
even better but that could be done

144
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,150
even better but that could be done
 

145
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,699
even better but that could be done
without the cool camera angles as well

146
00:02:59,699 --> 00:02:59,709
without the cool camera angles as well
 

147
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,590
without the cool camera angles as well
right so that's what it looks like when

148
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:01,600
right so that's what it looks like when
 

149
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,180
right so that's what it looks like when
two people are trying to make a show of

150
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,190
two people are trying to make a show of
 

151
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,530
two people are trying to make a show of
something and that's what you would see

152
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:04,540
something and that's what you would see
 

153
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,400
something and that's what you would see
in a movie or a TV show or any kind of

154
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,410
in a movie or a TV show or any kind of
 

155
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,509
in a movie or a TV show or any kind of
demonstration where someone wants to

156
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
demonstration where someone wants to
 

157
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,220
demonstration where someone wants to
show really cool stuff and it's like

158
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,230
show really cool stuff and it's like
 

159
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,900
show really cool stuff and it's like
look at how cool our martial art can

160
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:12,910
look at how cool our martial art can
 

161
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,120
look at how cool our martial art can
look now that doesn't mean that that's

162
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,130
look now that doesn't mean that that's
 

163
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,220
look now that doesn't mean that that's
how the sparring is going to play out

164
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,230
how the sparring is going to play out
 

165
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,170
how the sparring is going to play out
right so so the theatrical

166
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,180
right so so the theatrical
 

167
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,759
right so so the theatrical
representation is really far from the

representation is really far from the
 

169
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,380
representation is really far from the
sparring okay let's see some of that

170
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,390
sparring okay let's see some of that
 

171
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,020

same stuff now as a form and remember

172
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,030
same stuff now as a form and remember
 

173
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,050
same stuff now as a form and remember
the forms purpose is educational so here

174
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,060
the forms purpose is educational so here
 

175

the forms purpose is educational so here
you should see a lot of clean stuff it

176
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,530
you should see a lot of clean stuff it
 

177
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,949
you should see a lot of clean stuff it
won't necessarily look real cool unless

178
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:31,959
won't necessarily look real cool unless
 

179
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,210
won't necessarily look real cool unless
you're into forms and then it will look

180
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,220
you're into forms and then it will look
 

181
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,280
you're into forms and then it will look
super cool but if you're not it

182
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,290
super cool but if you're not it
 

183
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,870
super cool but if you're not it
particularly into forms then it's just

184
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:36,880
particularly into forms then it's just
 

185
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
particularly into forms then it's just
going to look real simple and clean now

186
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:38,890
going to look real simple and clean now
 

187
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,930
going to look real simple and clean now
that's also going to be different than

188
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:39,940
that's also going to be different than
 

189
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,400
that's also going to be different than
sparring so next we're going to look at

190
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,410
sparring so next we're going to look at
 

191
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,700
sparring so next we're going to look at
forms and check out how that looks

192
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:44,710
forms and check out how that looks
 

193
00:03:44,710 --> 00:04:37,180

195
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,450

okay so that is a classic form

196
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:40,460
okay so that is a classic form
 

197
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,340
okay so that is a classic form
representation so a classic form is what

it doesn't turn out that way and that's
 

235
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,080
it doesn't turn out that way and that's
a silly idea or if you haven't spent a

did you see that you go oh this is so
 

241
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
did you see that you go oh this is so
skilled that it's elevated above that

simple sparring stuff and and it'll come

244
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,030
simple sparring stuff and and it'll come

one of those two the truth is it is a

248
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,500
one of those two the truth is it is a
 

249
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,980
one of those two the truth is it is a
really clean and simplified way to look

250
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:39,990
really clean and simplified way to look
 

251
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,080
really clean and simplified way to look
at the stuff that will happen in a

252
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,090
at the stuff that will happen in a
 

253
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,760
at the stuff that will happen in a
sparring match but the sparring match

254
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:43,770
sparring match but the sparring match
 

255
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,670
sparring match but the sparring match
would never look like that looks alright

256
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:46,680
would never look like that looks alright
 

257
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
would never look like that looks alright
so now let's check out what it looks

258
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,570
so now let's check out what it looks
 

259
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,780
so now let's check out what it looks
like with these two sparring and I would

260
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:50,790
like with these two sparring and I would
 

261
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,070
like with these two sparring and I would
like to say that we're gonna see the

262
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
like to say that we're gonna see the
 

263
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
like to say that we're gonna see the
exact second techniques but in truth

264
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:53,850
exact second techniques but in truth
 

265
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,430

martial arts so a lot of times I think

300
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,210
martial arts so a lot of times I think
 

301
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,330
martial arts so a lot of times I think
because there is no direct compare and

302
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:57,340
because there is no direct compare and
 

303
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,130
because there is no direct compare and
contrast between the individuals we

304
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,140
contrast between the individuals we
 

305
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,720
contrast between the individuals we
think that like oh this guy must have

306
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:00,730
think that like oh this guy must have
 

307
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,450
think that like oh this guy must have
amazing superpowers or oh this guy's

308
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:03,460
amazing superpowers or oh this guy's
 

309
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,910
amazing superpowers or oh this guy's
just gritty or on the opposite side of

310
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:05,920
just gritty or on the opposite side of
 

311
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,600
just gritty or on the opposite side of
that spectrum

312
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,610
that spectrum
 

313
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,400
that spectrum
this guy's greedy and actually tough and

314
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,410
this guy's greedy and actually tough and
 

315
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,960
this guy's greedy and actually tough and
these people are kind of making stuff up

316
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:09,970
these people are kind of making stuff up
 

317
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,900
these people are kind of making stuff up
right so it's it's easy to mistake one

318
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:12,910
right so it's it's easy to mistake one
 

319
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,030
right so it's it's easy to mistake one
for the other so in this you get a real

320
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,040
for the other so in this you get a real
 

321
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,220
for the other so in this you get a real
clean compare and contrast between two

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,230
clean compare and contrast between two
 

323
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,380
clean compare and contrast between two
