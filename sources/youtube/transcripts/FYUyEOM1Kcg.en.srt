up to knock him down like this okay

392
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
up to knock him down like this okay
 

393
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,710
up to knock him down like this okay
now the second he hits the ground i'm

394
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
now the second he hits the ground i'm
 

395
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,230
now the second he hits the ground i'm
going to try and shoot up grab a hold of

396
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
going to try and shoot up grab a hold of
 

397
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,870
going to try and shoot up grab a hold of
this arm

398
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
this arm
 

399
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,390
this arm
and then work my way to get better

400
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
and then work my way to get better
 

401
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,990
and then work my way to get better
control the hand okay so

402
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
control the hand okay so
 

403
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,670
control the hand okay so
this is all in an ideal situation it's

404
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
this is all in an ideal situation it's
 

405
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,350
this is all in an ideal situation it's
probably not going to happen as nicely

406
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
probably not going to happen as nicely
 

407
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,390
probably not going to happen as nicely
as this but that's the way you're

408
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
as this but that's the way you're
 

409
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,590
as this but that's the way you're
thinking it's the process you're

410
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
thinking it's the process you're
 

411
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,110
thinking it's the process you're
thinking through when you're doing this

412
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
thinking through when you're doing this
 

413
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,790
thinking through when you're doing this
okay now i have to have weapon control

414
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
okay now i have to have weapon control
 

415
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,870
okay now i have to have weapon control
before i can do anything okay so my

416
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
before i can do anything okay so my
 

417
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,550
before i can do anything okay so my
basic ideas are could i just grab the

418
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
basic ideas are could i just grab the
 

419
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,029
basic ideas are could i just grab the
hand

420
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
hand
 

421
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,110
hand
could i get my foot in to control or

422
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
could i get my foot in to control or
 

423
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,870
could i get my foot in to control or
could i trap an arm up here by knocking

424
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
could i trap an arm up here by knocking
 

425
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,430
could i trap an arm up here by knocking
him down

426
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
him down
 

427
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,469
him down
those are the ways i'm going to work it

428
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
those are the ways i'm going to work it
 

429
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,310
those are the ways i'm going to work it
when i get a hold of the hand directly i

430
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
when i get a hold of the hand directly i
 

431
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,990
when i get a hold of the hand directly i
want to make sure i always have one hand

432
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
want to make sure i always have one hand
 

433
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,830
want to make sure i always have one hand
covering his fingers here like this so

434
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
covering his fingers here like this so
 

435
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,270
covering his fingers here like this so
that's what i'm looking for now from

436
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
that's what i'm looking for now from
 

437
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,749
that's what i'm looking for now from
here

438
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
here
 

439
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,590
here
it is possible to disarm and i'm going

440
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
it is possible to disarm and i'm going
 

441
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,350
it is possible to disarm and i'm going
to try to disarm and see if i can get it

442
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
to try to disarm and see if i can get it
 

443
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,909
to try to disarm and see if i can get it
from this

444
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
from this
 

445
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,990
from this
now disarming is a real simple process

446
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
now disarming is a real simple process
 

447
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,510
now disarming is a real simple process
i'm either going to turn his hand this

448

i'm either going to turn his hand this
 

449
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,990
i'm either going to turn his hand this
way

450
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
way
 

451
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,670
way
to lengthen all these ligaments and make

452
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
to lengthen all these ligaments and make
 

453
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,189

ligaments and make his hand weak
 

459
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,670
ligaments and make his hand weak
that's basically it now there are more

460
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
that's basically it now there are more
 

461
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,189
that's basically it now there are more
ways to do it than this but these are

462
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
ways to do it than this but these are
 

463
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,550
ways to do it than this but these are
the gross ways that you're going to use

464
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
the gross ways that you're going to use
 

465
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,749
the gross ways that you're going to use
most of the time

466
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
most of the time

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,829
those things and there's other ones we
can talk about too but

856
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
can talk about too but
 

857
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,430
can talk about too but
basically i'm roughly going to work that

858
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
basically i'm roughly going to work that
 

859
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,590
basically i'm roughly going to work that
number one or number two if it comes out

865
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,470
to try and get this guy off of me if it
doesn't come out then that's fine at

866
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
doesn't come out then that's fine at
 

867
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,670

least i have controlled the weapon i'm

868
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
least i have controlled the weapon i'm
 

869
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,030
least i have controlled the weapon i'm
gonna try and get this guy off of me so

870
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
gonna try and get this guy off of me so
 

871
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,710
gonna try and get this guy off of me so
that leads us to our next step which is

872
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
that leads us to our next step which is
 

873
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,870
that leads us to our next step which is
change position how do i change position

874
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
change position how do i change position
 

875
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,310
change position how do i change position
well the first way i'm gonna try to do

876
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
well the first way i'm gonna try to do
 

877
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,710
well the first way i'm gonna try to do
that

878
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
that
 

879
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,870
that
is just to nudge him to the side i'm

880
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
is just to nudge him to the side i'm
 

881
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,949
is just to nudge him to the side i'm
controlling so if i'm controlling his

882
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
controlling so if i'm controlling his
 

883
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,790
controlling so if i'm controlling his
left hand and his left leg i'm gonna

884
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
left hand and his left leg i'm gonna
 

885
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,550
left hand and his left leg i'm gonna
roll him to his left right so that's the

886
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
roll him to his left right so that's the
 

887
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,670
roll him to his left right so that's the
idea is i'm going to take him to that

888
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
idea is i'm going to take him to that
 

889
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,310
idea is i'm going to take him to that
direction

890
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
direction
 

891
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,430
direction
now that's not going to work a lot of

892
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
now that's not going to work a lot of
 

893
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,550
now that's not going to work a lot of
times we're going to talk about all the

894
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
times we're going to talk about all the
 

895
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,990
times we're going to talk about all the
other things that can happen in that but

896
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
other things that can happen in that but
 

897
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,269
other things that can happen in that but
this is our basic

898
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
this is our basic
 

899
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,710
this is our basic
overview of what happens if you find

900
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
overview of what happens if you find
 

901
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,269
overview of what happens if you find
yourself in that rough position assess

902
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
yourself in that rough position assess
 

903
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,750
yourself in that rough position assess
control or suppress if you can disarm in

904
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
control or suppress if you can disarm in
 

905
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,710
control or suppress if you can disarm in
that do so

906
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
that do so
 

907
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,590
that do so
if you cannot change position right so

908
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
if you cannot change position right so
 

909
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,870
if you cannot change position right so
that's what we're working towards in

910
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
that's what we're working towards in
 

911
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,590
that's what we're working towards in
that whole thing

912
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
