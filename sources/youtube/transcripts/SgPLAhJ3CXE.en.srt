00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,519
that and I'm gonna yield it okay so I
want you guys to energetic

168
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:02,529

 

169
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:31,980

oh he feels the initial percussion then

170
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:31,990
oh he feels the initial percussion then
 

171
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,220
oh he feels the initial percussion then
there's a class it's my job to reconcile

172
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,230
there's a class it's my job to reconcile
 

173
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,780
there's a class it's my job to reconcile
the class okay

174
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:36,790
the class okay
 

175
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,860
the class okay
and what we know from our own training

176
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:39,870
and what we know from our own training
 

177
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,989
and what we know from our own training
we're not push you which is what

178
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:42,999
we're not push you which is what
 

179
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,429
we're not push you which is what
happened on the first one in

180
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:44,439
happened on the first one in
 

181
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,769
happened on the first one in
psychologically you're gonna push back

182
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:46,779
psychologically you're gonna push back
 

183
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:54,749
psychologically you're gonna push back
so I can use that to get around I let

184
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:54,759
so I can use that to get around I let
 

185
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,569
so I can use that to get around I let
you go by so I can enter this is a much

186
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:57,579
you go by so I can enter this is a much
 

187
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,759
you go by so I can enter this is a much
better position than this one you say

188
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:02,769
better position than this one you say
 

189
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:13,460
better position than this one you say
are you mediator to go yield this one

190
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,470

 

191
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,059

okay up to that point okay so I've been

192
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:17,069
okay up to that point okay so I've been
 

193
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,769
okay up to that point okay so I've been
exaggerating things so you can see the

194
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:19,779
exaggerating things so you can see the
 

195
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,590
exaggerating things so you can see the
moments in the patterns like it can't be

196
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,600
moments in the patterns like it can't be
 

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,249
moments in the patterns like it can't be
that way okay so that's why the first

198
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:26,259
that way okay so that's why the first
 

199
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,290
that way okay so that's why the first
one looks like the are manipulation but

200
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,300
one looks like the are manipulation but
 

201
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,480
one looks like the are manipulation but
the kid goes whoa that was totally

202
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,490
the kid goes whoa that was totally
 

203
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,990
the kid goes whoa that was totally
different

204
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,000
different
 

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,519
different
okay but the same thing goes on so as I

206
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:35,529
okay but the same thing goes on so as I
 

207
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,920
okay but the same thing goes on so as I
come around here oh there's going to be

208
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,930
come around here oh there's going to be
 

209
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,670
come around here oh there's going to be
a flexion that happens right in time

210
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:40,680
a flexion that happens right in time
 

211
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,689
a flexion that happens right in time
reflection the pressure the accumulation

212
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:45,699
reflection the pressure the accumulation
 

213
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,390
reflection the pressure the accumulation
of energy the pressurization of

214
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:48,400
of energy the pressurization of
 

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,329
of energy the pressurization of
and the releasing of energy that's the

216
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:51,339
and the releasing of energy that's the
 

217
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,900
and the releasing of energy that's the
perfume so you you will feel that as you

218
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:54,910
perfume so you you will feel that as you
 

219
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,060
perfume so you you will feel that as you
go it's inside so you feel it probably a

220
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,070
go it's inside so you feel it probably a
 

221
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,310
go it's inside so you feel it probably a
structural alignment at this point but

222
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
structural alignment at this point but
 

223
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
structural alignment at this point but
as you come around here that's where

224
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,330
as you come around here that's where
 

225
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,720
as you come around here that's where
pressure starts to accumulate right and

226
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:06,730
pressure starts to accumulate right and
 

227
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,530
pressure starts to accumulate right and
we come around and my stomach will come

228
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:10,540
we come around and my stomach will come
 

229
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:19,290
we come around and my stomach will come
out and usually to feel that okay don't

230
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,300
out and usually to feel that okay don't
 

231
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,980
out and usually to feel that okay don't
push it

232
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:19,990
push it
 

233
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,829
push it
just touch so whoa it's nothing as weak

234
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
just touch so whoa it's nothing as weak
 

235
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,290
just touch so whoa it's nothing as weak
as I start to bring his energy okay and

236
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:31,300
as I start to bring his energy okay and
 

237
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,620
as I start to bring his energy okay and
that's what he feels now when I do this

238
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:34,630
that's what he feels now when I do this
 

239
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,019
that's what he feels now when I do this
watch it watch his body watch his body

240
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:39,029
watch it watch his body watch his body
 

241
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,710
watch it watch his body watch his body
is it moving

242
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
is it moving
 

243
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,510
is it moving
yeah it's moving but I have to move my

244
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:42,520
yeah it's moving but I have to move my
 

245
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,320
yeah it's moving but I have to move my
arm so the unit manifestation is let it

246
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,330
arm so the unit manifestation is let it
 

247
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,210
arm so the unit manifestation is let it
pass disappear itself you see inside not

248
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,220
pass disappear itself you see inside not
 

249
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,120
pass disappear itself you see inside not
like that so I'm going to do all the we

250
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,130
like that so I'm going to do all the we
 

251
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,440
like that so I'm going to do all the we
were together and everything is inside

252
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,450
were together and everything is inside
 

253
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,460
were together and everything is inside
you see so I don't make this baby other

254
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,470
you see so I don't make this baby other
 

255
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:13,530
you see so I don't make this baby other
circle on the technique do you see this

256
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:13,540
circle on the technique do you see this
 

257
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:23,640
circle on the technique do you see this
light over here that was it but he feels

258
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:23,650
light over here that was it but he feels
 

259
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,490
light over here that was it but he feels
it you guys he feels there was some like

260
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:26,500
it you guys he feels there was some like
 

261
00:12:26,500 --> 00:13:31,800
it you guys he feels there was some like
inertia and then all of a sudden

262
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:31,810

 

263
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,629
