223
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,430

both okay try it so uh again that's

both okay try it so uh again that's
 

225
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,509
both okay try it so uh again that's
generally the external aspect of it okay

226

generally the external aspect of it okay
 

227
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,870
generally the external aspect of it okay
but you you can't even do the external

228
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
but you you can't even do the external
 

229
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,910
but you you can't even do the external
aspect of it without the internal aspect

okay so for example those kicks I were

232
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
okay so for example those kicks I were
 

233
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,430
okay so for example those kicks I were
showing if I was pushing on him

234
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,440
showing if I was pushing on him
 

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,710
showing if I was pushing on him
externally I wouldn't be able to raise

so we did a Gateway video on this

240
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
so we did a Gateway video on this
 

241
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,829
so we did a Gateway video on this
okay so here is his resistance of his

242
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
okay so here is his resistance of his
 

243
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,189
okay so here is his resistance of his
elbow represented here you see and if I

244
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:55,199
elbow represented here you see and if I
 

245
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,150
elbow represented here you see and if I
try to walk I I will take myself off

246
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
try to walk I I will take myself off
 

247
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,949
try to walk I I will take myself off
balance okay but when when I learn the

248
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
balance okay but when when I learn the
 

249
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,310
balance okay but when when I learn the
ground Then I then I can walk okay so

250
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
ground Then I then I can walk okay so
 

251
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,949
ground Then I then I can walk okay so
I'll demonstrate it in the

252
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:07,959

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,000
doing it what I'm talking about your
 

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,470
doing it what I'm talking about your
foot kind of flows so you're you're here

258
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,480
foot kind of flows so you're you're here
 

259
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,629
foot kind of flows so you're you're here
and you're like

260
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:17,639
and you're like
 

261
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,230
and you're like
who kind of hangs there okay as as

262
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
who kind of hangs there okay as as
 

263
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,389
who kind of hangs there okay as as
opposed to you don't need your base do

264
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,399
opposed to you don't need your base do
 

265
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,550
opposed to you don't need your base do
you see I didn't need the the brace and

266
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:27,560
you see I didn't need the the brace and
 

267
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,189
you see I didn't need the the brace and
angle base because the energy is being

268
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:30,199
angle base because the energy is being
 

269
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,310
angle base because the energy is being
vectored down do you see that so you

270
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,320
vectored down do you see that so you
 

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,150
vectored down do you see that so you
didn't see a big deviation you can see

272
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
didn't see a big deviation you can see
 

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,150
didn't see a big deviation you can see
my kick still come around and I still

274
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
my kick still come around and I still
 

275
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,350
my kick still come around and I still
block him around

276
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,360
block him around
 

277
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,990
block him around
okay

278
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,000
okay
 

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,110
okay
um so going to the energetic one you you

280
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,120
um so going to the energetic one you you
 

281
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,629
um so going to the energetic one you you
want to play with your I and your

287
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,310
the the the in between the lional state
of Yin and Yang aspects that's where you

288
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
of Yin and Yang aspects that's where you
 

289
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,189
of Yin and Yang aspects that's where you
want to hang out okay and that's where

the ik is so I internally I'm letting
 

293
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:24,550
the ik is so I internally I'm letting
his energy go through

294
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560

 

295
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,829

me down to the ground the young aspect

296
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
me down to the ground the young aspect
 

297
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,350
me down to the ground the young aspect
is being generated by him her

298
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,360
is being generated by him her
 

299
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,910
is being generated by him her
prescription and I let that ground and

300
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:32,920
prescription and I let that ground and
 

301
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,189
prescription and I let that ground and
go in me so I want you to pay attention

302
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:36,199
go in me so I want you to pay attention
 

303
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,870
go in me so I want you to pay attention
now how I'm not really interested in Arm

304
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
now how I'm not really interested in Arm
 

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,910
now how I'm not really interested in Arm
Control okay I you'll see that because

306
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:44,920
Control okay I you'll see that because
 

307
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,670
Control okay I you'll see that because
I'm just interested

308
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm just interested
 

309
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,949
I'm just interested
energetically what concentrically

310
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
energetically what concentrically
 

311
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,550
energetically what concentrically
happens is I'm actually manipulating his

312
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
happens is I'm actually manipulating his
 

313
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,629
happens is I'm actually manipulating his
body you see because his young aspect is

314
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
body you see because his young aspect is
 

315
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,150
body you see because his young aspect is
more in his body than in his hand

316
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,160
more in his body than in his hand
 

317
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,430
more in his body than in his hand
especially at the distal end okay so if

318
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,440
especially at the distal end okay so if
 

319
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,150
especially at the distal end okay so if
you if you watch I'm kind of inside his

320
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
you if you watch I'm kind of inside his
 

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,389
you if you watch I'm kind of inside his
movement and he's going around me well

322
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
movement and he's going around me well
 

323
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,430
movement and he's going around me well
I'll keep the external part the same

324
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440
I'll keep the external part the same
 

325
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,150
I'll keep the external part the same
okay so here

326
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
okay so here
 

327
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:25,110
okay so here

329
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,309

just watch his body now his body

330
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:31,319

 

331
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:40,670

333
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,829

and you'll see I kind of like surfing

334
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
and you'll see I kind of like surfing
 

335
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:57,590
and you'll see I kind of like surfing
the tube surfing the

336
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:19,880
his energy is not actually pushing on
 

343
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,189
his energy is not actually pushing on
me it is going around me it is going

344
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
me it is going around me it is going
 

345
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,870
me it is going around me it is going
around

346
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
around
 

347
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,269
around
me but if I do that externally you won't

348
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:28,279
me but if I do that externally you won't
 

349
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,629
me but if I do that externally you won't
get your feet you won't be able to move

357
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,509
off of you and then you
enter because you had to wait for it to

358
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
enter because you had to wait for it to
 

359
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,110
enter because you had to wait for it to
go off of you to enter you're reduced to

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
go off of you to enter you're reduced to

fighting the arm not the person or you
 

363

365
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:10,189

okay

366
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:10,199

 

367
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:25,350

the point of the training is to not feel

368
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360

 

369
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:57,390

here it's not to pin his elbow

370
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,400

373
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,870

there is

374
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
there is
 

375
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,029
there is
a spiritual aspect to it as we've been

376
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039

 

377
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,549

mentioning my

compromise your base you're going to
 

397
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,029
compromise your base you're going to
have to pull all this kind of stuff

398
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
have to pull all this kind of stuff
 

399
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,350
have to pull all this kind of stuff
okay but what you're not

400
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,360
okay but what you're not
 

401
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,029
okay but what you're not
realizing

402
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:20,039
realizing
 

403
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,950
realizing
is the mechanical advantage you perceive

404
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
is the mechanical advantage you perceive
 

405
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,070
is the mechanical advantage you perceive
is not actually there okay

406
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
is not actually there okay
 

407
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,510
is not actually there okay
so I am not a big man but I am much

408
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
so I am not a big man but I am much
 

409

around go ahead it's fine I won't even
 

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,110
around go ahead it's fine I won't even
deal with the inertia here we go

414
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120

 

415
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,070

go what I'll give you here okay push

416
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
go what I'll give you here okay push
 

417
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,510
go what I'll give you here okay push
down push

418
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520

 

419
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,230

down so again I'm not

420
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
down so again I'm not
 

421
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,830
down so again I'm not
trying

422
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
trying
 

423
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,750
trying
you could do this

424
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:02,760
you could do this
 

425
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:27,149
you could do this
push and in that I can do my stuff of

426
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:27,159

 

427
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,350

course

428
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360

 

429
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,590

I picked that one because it seems like

430
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
I picked that one because it seems like
 

431
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,950
I picked that one because it seems like
oh so able to do it but

432
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:39,960
oh so able to do it but
 

433
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,990
oh so able to do it but
no okay you want to

434
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,000

00:21:59,630 --> 00:21:59,640
example uh you're always going to have
 

477
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,310
example uh you're always going to have
the physical

478
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,320
the physical
 

479
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,310
the physical
component but you're going to always

480
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:03,320
component but you're going to always
 

481
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,190
component but you're going to always
have the internal component okay you

482
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,200
have the internal component okay you
 

483
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,710
have the internal component okay you
wouldn't do like a lot of I would say

484
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
wouldn't do like a lot of I would say
 

485
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,990
wouldn't do like a lot of I would say
contemporary taiichi where they try to

486
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
contemporary taiichi where they try to
 

487
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,350
contemporary taiichi where they try to
take out the external component all the

488
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
take out the external component all the
 

489
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,149
take out the external component all the
time uh I'm all for doing that so that

490
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
time uh I'm all for doing that so that
 

491
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,549
time uh I'm all for doing that so that
you can see what is actually happening

492
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:25,559
you can see what is actually happening
 

493
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,190
you can see what is actually happening
at the internal level but I'm not not

494
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,200
at the internal level but I'm not not
 

495
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,909
at the internal level but I'm not not
for that that's the way okay you do want

496
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
for that that's the way okay you do want
 

497
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,870
for that that's the way okay you do want
to move you want to have your external

498
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
to move you want to have your external
 

499
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,070
to move you want to have your external
level concentrically manifesting the

500
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,080
level concentrically manifesting the
 

501
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,789
level concentrically manifesting the
internal uh level so for R3 components

502
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:43,799
internal uh level so for R3 components
 

503
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,909
internal uh level so for R3 components
you would always have the physical

504
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:46,919
you would always have the physical
 

505
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,430
you would always have the physical
component being concentrically

506
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
component being concentrically
 

507
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,350
component being concentrically
manifested and vice versa at the

508
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,360
manifested and vice versa at the
 

509
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,710
manifested and vice versa at the
energetic component do you understand we

510
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
energetic component do you understand we
 

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,029
energetic component do you understand we
we are not shooting for one or the other

512
00:22:58,029 --> 00:22:58,039
we are not shooting for one or the other
 

513
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,470
we are not shooting for one or the other
okay so if you have modern iido and

514
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
okay so if you have modern iido and
 

515
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,390
okay so if you have modern iido and
you're all external I'm going to say no

516
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
you're all external I'm going to say no
 

517
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,430
you're all external I'm going to say no
because you can't enter a Lial phase

518
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,440
because you can't enter a Lial phase
 

519
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,070
because you can't enter a Lial phase
with one aspect and if we have the

520
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
with one aspect and if we have the
 

521
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,909
with one aspect and if we have the
internal people and all they do is stand

522
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
internal people and all they do is stand
 

523
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,029
internal people and all they do is stand
still and try to get everything to go

524
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:16,039
