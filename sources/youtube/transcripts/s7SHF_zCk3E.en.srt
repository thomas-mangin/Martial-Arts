00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:13,900
vertical space for it okay you can do
 

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,140
vertical space for it okay you can do
that too in combination with your

you lift your shoulders up we'll go back
that down watching I lift my shoulders

66
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,190
that down watching I lift my shoulders
 

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,680
that down watching I lift my shoulders
up you see

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,690
up you see
 

69
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,510
up you see
I create the same space as I did with my

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:27,520
I create the same space as I did with my
 

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:35,190
I create the same space as I did with my
knee back so I also and this is key why

72
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
knee back so I also and this is key why
 

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,900
knee back so I also and this is key why
should my hands do the same exact thing

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:38,910
should my hands do the same exact thing
 

75
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,510

83
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,000
state cockpit they can't be doing the
same thing at the same time so you see

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,010
same thing at the same time so you see
 

85
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,070
same thing at the same time so you see
one two

115
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,639

you can't do it every time so when

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:10,649
you can't do it every time so when
 

117
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,949
you can't do it every time so when
you're not used to that right you're

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:12,959
you're not used to that right you're
 

119
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,839
you're not used to that right you're
used to the pirouette Academy and

someone does that which they should
 

123
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,649
someone does that which they should
because it's an opening it's a yin space

124
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:18,659
because it's an opening it's a yin space
 

125

because it's an opening it's a yin space
so he goes to take that boom

126
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:20,999
so he goes to take that boom
 

127
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:24,649
so he goes to take that boom
and you're like oh man that's you're not

128
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:24,659
and you're like oh man that's you're not
 

129

and you're like oh man that's you're not
gonna do it

130
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:28,559

 

131
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,449

but here's the same kind of problem he

132
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:32,459
but here's the same kind of problem he
 

133
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,789
but here's the same kind of problem he
comes around he takes the other stuff do

134
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:34,799
comes around he takes the other stuff do
 

135
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,799
comes around he takes the other stuff do
you see and you're here like this and

136
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:36,809
you see and you're here like this and
 

137
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:43,129
you see and you're here like this and
the same thing and he can't take that

138
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:43,139
the same thing and he can't take that
 

139
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,199
the same thing and he can't take that
second step once he takes the first step

140
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,209
second step once he takes the first step
 

141
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,939
second step once he takes the first step
so he should because there's he in space

142
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:46,949
so he should because there's he in space
 

143
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,799
so he should because there's he in space
there so the way that he's falling we're

144
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:51,809
there so the way that he's falling we're
 

145
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,179
there so the way that he's falling we're
gonna go a little slower

146
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:53,189
gonna go a little slower
 

147
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,679
gonna go a little slower
wait okay it's that this is going

148
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:57,689
wait okay it's that this is going
 

149
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:04,609
wait okay it's that this is going
forward this way this way go back do you
