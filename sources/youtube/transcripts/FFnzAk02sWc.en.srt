00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,869

so we're going to look

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
so we're going to look
 

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,710
so we're going to look
at the different types of training so we

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
at the different types of training so we
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,749
at the different types of training so we
have Kona that's one type of training

6
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:10,759
have Kona that's one type of training
 

7
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,709
have Kona that's one type of training
guaza another type of training and I'm

8
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:13,719
guaza another type of training and I'm
 

9
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,470
guaza another type of training and I'm
not listing all the different types then

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
not listing all the different types then
 

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,830
not listing all the different types then
o hkaa another type and then sparring

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
o hkaa another type and then sparring
 

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,630
o hkaa another type and then sparring
another type okay first let's just start

14
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,640
another type okay first let's just start
 

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,189
another type okay first let's just start
with kihon Wasa then and it's important

16
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:26,199
with kihon Wasa then and it's important
 

17
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,950
with kihon Wasa then and it's important
to know that these are different types

18
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:27,960
to know that these are different types
 

19
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,509
to know that these are different types
so that we don't try to make

20
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:30,519
so that we don't try to make
 

21
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,470
so that we don't try to make
in particular Kona every type of

22
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
in particular Kona every type of
 

23
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,670
in particular Kona every type of
training and therefore force it to

24
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
training and therefore force it to
 

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,869
training and therefore force it to
solve what is other types of training's

26
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
solve what is other types of training's
 

27
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,830
solve what is other types of training's

396
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
technique if we look at this
 

397
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,350
technique if we look at this
psychologically there in in

398
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:10,360
psychologically there in in
 

399
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,509
psychologically there in in
this I have

400
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519

 

401
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,790

pre-selected in this case it was

402
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:17,800
pre-selected in this case it was
 

403
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,310
pre-selected in this case it was
selected for me but there's still a

404
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
selected for me but there's still a
 

405
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,470
selected for me but there's still a
pre-election to the doing

pre-election to the doing
 

407
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,430
pre-election to the doing
it a lot of times when people do Gaza

408

it a lot of times when people do Gaza
 

409
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,670
it a lot of times when people do Gaza
especially if the game has a rule such

that katat do it from
katat you will still see

414
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
katat you will still see
 

415
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,230

pre-election to me that is not Gaza
 

417
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,310
pre-election to me that is not Gaza
that's just you picked the technique in

418
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,320
that's just you picked the technique in
 

419
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,990
that's just you picked the technique in
this one the teacher the teacher told me

420
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
this one the teacher the teacher told me
 

421
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,430
this one the teacher the teacher told me
but in this

pre-election this is not g AA to me in
fact

430
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
fact
 

431
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,430
fact
Gaza is I don't pick the

432
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,440
Gaza is I don't pick the
 

433
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,990
Gaza is I don't pick the
technique I don't pick

434
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
technique I don't pick
 

435
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,430
technique I don't pick
it I don't want my ego tripartite mind

436
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:12,440
it I don't want my ego tripartite mind
 

437
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,870
it I don't want my ego tripartite mind
involved in this practice this practice

438
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:15,880
involved in this practice this practice
 

439
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,829
involved in this practice this practice
is about not using the ego tripartite

440
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:18,839
is about not using the ego tripartite
 

441
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,670
is about not using the ego tripartite
mind so you do not pre-select your

442
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
mind so you do not pre-select your
 

443
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,069
mind so you do not pre-select your
techniques even if you silently

444
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
techniques even if you silently
 

445
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,870
techniques even if you silently
pre-select them to yourselves

446
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
pre-select them to yourselves
 

447
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,430
pre-select them to yourselves
okay it is very difficult to do that if

448
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
okay it is very difficult to do that if
 

449
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,910
okay it is very difficult to do that if
you do a technique right from

450
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:34,920
you do a technique right from
 

451
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,350
you do a technique right from
contact if the person comes in and does

452
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:38,360
contact if the person comes in and does
 

453
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,509
contact if the person comes in and does
their little push you pick your

454
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519

 

455
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,470

Technique it's difficult for the user to

456
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
Technique it's difficult for the user to
 

457
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,269
Technique it's difficult for the user to
go oh I picked that they're not usually

458
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
go oh I picked that they're not usually
 

459
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,870
go oh I picked that they're not usually
that honest we're not usually that

460
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
that honest we're not usually that
 

461
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,470
that honest we're not usually that
honest with ourselves but that teacher a

462
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,480
honest with ourselves but that teacher a
 

463
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,750
honest with ourselves but that teacher a
master can tell when the ego tripartite

464
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:56,760
master can tell when the ego tripartite
 

465
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,110
master can tell when the ego tripartite
mind functions and usually they'll tell

466
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
mind functions and usually they'll tell
 

467
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,629
mind functions and usually they'll tell
you hey don't pick the technique hey

468
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
you hey don't pick the technique hey
 

469
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,710
you hey don't pick the technique hey
don't pick the technique so a kind of

470
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
don't pick the technique so a kind of
 

471
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,069
don't pick the technique so a kind of
thing that I

472
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:05,079
thing that I
 

473
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,430
thing that I
do to get people where can you do this

474
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,440
do to get people where can you do this
 

475
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,910
do to get people where can you do this
and it's not pre-election is don't do

476
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:10,920
and it's not pre-election is don't do
 

477
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,030
and it's not pre-election is don't do
the move on

478
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
the move on
 

479
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,030
the move on
contact do some generic

480
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
contact do some generic
 

481
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,710
contact do some generic
deviation based on where and how they're

482
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
deviation based on where and how they're
 

483
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,310
deviation based on where and how they're
creating their young young Clash okay

we're going to do okay so I would do

522
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
we're going to do okay so I would do
 

523
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,949
we're going to do okay so I would do
this first is

524
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:19,959

 

525
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,629

deviate according to however they're

526
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
deviate according to however they're
 

527
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,670
deviate according to however they're
pushing then UK all UK react to that UK

528
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
pushing then UK all UK react to that UK
 

529
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,069
pushing then UK all UK react to that UK
reacts spontaneously to that because

530
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:31,079
reacts spontaneously to that because
 

531
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,389
reacts spontaneously to that because
they don't know

532
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
they don't know
 

533
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,550
they don't know
that they don't know how you're going to

534
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
that they don't know how you're going to
 

535
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,990
that they don't know how you're going to
do that and then so UK reacts and now

536
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,000
do that and then so UK reacts and now
 

537
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,230
do that and then so UK reacts and now
this is an immediate action and now you

538
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
this is an immediate action and now you
 

539
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,030
this is an immediate action and now you
respond to that okay here's where you

540
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,040
respond to that okay here's where you
 

541
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,590
respond to that okay here's where you
respond and so in a way you didn't pick

542
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
respond and so in a way you didn't pick
 

543
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,550
respond and so in a way you didn't pick
it UK picked it got it and UK can't pick

544
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:53,560
it UK picked it got it and UK can't pick
 

545
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,509
it UK picked it got it and UK can't pick
it again because the next time they'll

546
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
it again because the next time they'll
 

547
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,269
it again because the next time they'll
de you'll deviate a little different and

548
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:58,279
de you'll deviate a little different and
 

549
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,189
de you'll deviate a little different and
they'll react a little different every

550
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:00,199
they'll react a little different every
 

551
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,150
they'll react a little different every
time and so you'll have this is this is

552
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,160
time and so you'll have this is this is
 

553
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,990
time and so you'll have this is this is
the moment where you can start guaza

Center you you're not moving moving the
 

1031
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,590
Center you you're not moving moving the
center in and now you have these two

1032
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,600
center in and now you have these two
 

1033
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,870
center in and now you have these two
stay there please these two things are

1034
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
stay there please these two things are
 

1035

stay there please these two things are
working on her you add her initial

1036

working on her you add her initial
 

1037
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,230
working on her you add her initial
movement and it's even more you could

1038
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
movement and it's even more you could
 

1039
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,750
movement and it's even more you could
move her center around wherever you want

1040
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:10,760
move her center around wherever you want
 

1041
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,950

out for the strip okay you have to have
 

1051
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,389
out for the strip okay you have to have
the center boom then I went to the base

1052
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:27,399
the center boom then I went to the base
 

1053
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,750
the center boom then I went to the base
okay

1054
