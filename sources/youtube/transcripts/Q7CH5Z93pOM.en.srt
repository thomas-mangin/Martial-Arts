00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,230

so just imagine that there are four

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,240
so just imagine that there are four
 

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,299
so just imagine that there are four
mechanically sound ways of moving and

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:08,309
mechanically sound ways of moving and
 

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,730
mechanically sound ways of moving and
less mechanically sound ways there's

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,740
less mechanically sound ways there's
 

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,689
less mechanically sound ways there's
better bridges and less better bridges

8
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:17,699
better bridges and less better bridges
 

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:25,730
better bridges and less better bridges
okay so they the assumption is always in

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:25,740
okay so they the assumption is always in
 

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,689
okay so they the assumption is always in
katate dori that you can just do

12
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:29,699
katate dori that you can just do
 

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,120
katate dori that you can just do
whatever you can

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,130
whatever you can
 

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,139
whatever you can
then wrist angle the handshake the elbow

16
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:36,149
then wrist angle the handshake the elbow
 

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,780
then wrist angle the handshake the elbow
angle the shoulder I can go it was all

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:38,790
angle the shoulder I can go it was all
 

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,299
angle the shoulder I can go it was all
very important

20
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:40,309
very important
 

21
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,639
very important
every time you deviate from that you

22
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:43,649
every time you deviate from that you
 

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:51,529
every time you deviate from that you
have issues okay so you're not learning

24
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:51,539
have issues okay so you're not learning
 

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,869
have issues okay so you're not learning
the wrist grab you're more interested in

26
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879
the wrist grab you're more interested in
 

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,500
the wrist grab you're more interested in
this biomechanical geometry right and of

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,510
this biomechanical geometry right and of
 

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,200
this biomechanical geometry right and of
course it extends below but we're not

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,210
course it extends below but we're not
 

31
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,510
course it extends below but we're not
going to deal with that today just deal

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,520
going to deal with that today just deal
 

33
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,429
going to deal with that today just deal
with the arm okay

34
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
with the arm okay
 

35
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,870
with the arm okay
you're too straight to event to out to

36
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
you're too straight to event to out to
 

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,370
you're too straight to event to out to
in is happening all the time okay so if

38
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,380
in is happening all the time okay so if
 

39
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,649
in is happening all the time okay so if
I if I take could touch the dirty and

40
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
I if I take could touch the dirty and
 

41
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,969
I if I take could touch the dirty and
then bring my hands up right not like

42
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:19,979
then bring my hands up right not like
 

43
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,350
then bring my hands up right not like
I'm gonna do a technique because now

44
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
I'm gonna do a technique because now
 

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm gonna do a technique because now
everyone's closer to this you see but if

46
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:23,490
everyone's closer to this you see but if
 

47
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,420
everyone's closer to this you see but if
I just bring my hands I end up here

48
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,430
I just bring my hands I end up here
 

49
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,569
I just bring my hands I end up here
slightly in slightly forward elbows

50
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:32,579
slightly in slightly forward elbows
 

51
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,840
slightly in slightly forward elbows
underneath okay

52
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:34,850
underneath okay
 

53
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,340
underneath okay
that's what we're trying to work on so

54
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,350
that's what we're trying to work on so
 

55
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:47,539
that's what we're trying to work on so
this angle helps going to be force helps

56
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:47,549
this angle helps going to be force helps
 

57
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,160
this angle helps going to be force helps
let's just look at one thing

58
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,170
let's just look at one thing
 

59
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,870
let's just look at one thing
this is the best angle for generating a

60
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
this is the best angle for generating a
 

61
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,140
this is the best angle for generating a
resistance

62
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,150
resistance
 

63
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,560
resistance
energy to his resistance okay so I don't

64
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,570
energy to his resistance okay so I don't
 

65
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,900
energy to his resistance okay so I don't
want to push like this it takes it and

66
00:01:59,900 --> 00:01:59,910
want to push like this it takes it and
 

67
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,000
want to push like this it takes it and
puts it somewhere else in my inner

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,010
puts it somewhere else in my inner
 

69
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,940
puts it somewhere else in my inner
deltoids and outer pitfalls I don't I

70
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
deltoids and outer pitfalls I don't I
 

71
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,930
deltoids and outer pitfalls I don't I
don't want it there

72
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:05,940
don't want it there
 

73
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,770
don't want it there
I want my my back you see my back go

74
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,780
I want my my back you see my back go
 

75
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,540
I want my my back you see my back go
like this this is now something else

76
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:11,550
like this this is now something else
 

77
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,780
like this this is now something else
okay

78
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:15,790

 

79
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,360

so this one too is because of its shape

80
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,370
so this one too is because of its shape
 

81
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,979
so this one too is because of its shape
and I'm just going to mention this here

82
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:22,989
and I'm just going to mention this here
 

83
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,500
and I'm just going to mention this here
is this is what actually generates the

84
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,510
is this is what actually generates the
 

85
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,130
is this is what actually generates the
pressure into my heart up and starts to

86
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,140
pressure into my heart up and starts to
 

87
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,960
pressure into my heart up and starts to
utilize it when you go when you go like

88
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:30,970
utilize it when you go when you go like
 

89
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,720
utilize it when you go when you go like
this goes up high because it doesn't aim

90
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:33,730
this goes up high because it doesn't aim
 

91
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,410
this goes up high because it doesn't aim
down okay so we're gonna look at the arm

92
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,420
down okay so we're gonna look at the arm
 

93
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,589
down okay so we're gonna look at the arm
to start with the arm okay look at my

94
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
to start with the arm okay look at my
 

95
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,680
to start with the arm okay look at my
angle of my bra just forget like there's

96
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,690
angle of my bra just forget like there's
 

97
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,670
angle of my bra just forget like there's
any lower arm

98
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,680
any lower arm
 

99
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,920
any lower arm
mid to upper arm okay and he's going to

100
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:54,930
mid to upper arm okay and he's going to
 

101
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,710
mid to upper arm okay and he's going to
push and usually when he pushes here you

102
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
push and usually when he pushes here you
 

103
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,289
push and usually when he pushes here you
you will start to feel the pressure to

104
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:01,299
you will start to feel the pressure to
 

105
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,569
you will start to feel the pressure to
come up it'll come around this auto pan

106
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:03,579
come up it'll come around this auto pan
 

107
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,190
come up it'll come around this auto pan
okay and you see he can't put on the

108
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,200
okay and you see he can't put on the
 

109
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,589
okay and you see he can't put on the
armor straight so when I go like this I

110
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:10,599
armor straight so when I go like this I
 

111
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,619
armor straight so when I go like this I
can't really you can't push them right

112
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:13,629
can't really you can't push them right
 

113
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,970
can't really you can't push them right
and they can't be too close right

114
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
and they can't be too close right
 

115
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,879
and they can't be too close right
because he just pushes it at my ribcage

116
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:19,889
because he just pushes it at my ribcage
 

117
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:25,140
because he just pushes it at my ribcage
so there becomes like unmovable thing

118
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,150
so there becomes like unmovable thing
 

119
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,370
so there becomes like unmovable thing
that is there

120
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,380
that is there
 

121
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,050
that is there
and this is what we referred to as elbow

122
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,060
and this is what we referred to as elbow
 

123
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,260
and this is what we referred to as elbow
power it's the elbow is being energized

124
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,270
power it's the elbow is being energized
 

125
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,750
power it's the elbow is being energized
where it is its most efficient place to

126
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
where it is its most efficient place to
 

127
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,750
where it is its most efficient place to
speak okay so you can just hang out here

128
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:36,760
speak okay so you can just hang out here
 

129
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,850
speak okay so you can just hang out here
there's no hinge in my it between my

130
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:38,860
there's no hinge in my it between my
 

131
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,850
there's no hinge in my it between my
elbow my shoulder I just hang out of

132
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:41,860
elbow my shoulder I just hang out of
 

133
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,920
elbow my shoulder I just hang out of
here okay don't worry what this arm is

134
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:46,930
here okay don't worry what this arm is
 

135
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,820
here okay don't worry what this arm is
doing right now just focus on that elbow

136
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:50,830
doing right now just focus on that elbow
 

137
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,280
doing right now just focus on that elbow
being in that place where I can hang out

138
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,290
being in that place where I can hang out
 

139
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,230
being in that place where I can hang out
all of it

140
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,240

 

141
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,730

the now user is trying to be and we're

142
00:03:59,730 --> 00:03:59,740
the now user is trying to be and we're
 

143
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,750
the now user is trying to be and we're
going to increase the way what I'm doing

144
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
going to increase the way what I'm doing
 

145
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,180
going to increase the way what I'm doing
the same thing she's not don't hate

146
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,190
the same thing she's not don't hate
 

147
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,059
the same thing she's not don't hate
don't worry about what the lower

148
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:12,069
don't worry about what the lower
 

149
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:29,120
don't worry about what the lower
just leave that elbow right in that spot

150
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,130

 

151
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,450

yeah

152
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,460

 

153
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:51,190

so see how it's too high

154
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,200

 

155
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,200

okay so when I say in don't go like that

156
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,210
okay so when I say in don't go like that
 

157
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:05,100
okay so when I say in don't go like that
if you move the whole thing okay this

158
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,110

 

159
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,510

arm has the lower has so much range in

160
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
arm has the lower has so much range in
 

161
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,740
arm has the lower has so much range in
its arc of movement it becomes the elbow

162
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:17,750
its arc of movement it becomes the elbow
 

163
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,720
its arc of movement it becomes the elbow
came up you see this would be too much

164
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:21,730
came up you see this would be too much
 

165
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,510
came up you see this would be too much
and then if the hand goes down and the

166
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
and then if the hand goes down and the
 

167
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,460
and then if the hand goes down and the
elbow disappears so you only have elbow

168
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,470
elbow disappears so you only have elbow
 

169
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,910
elbow disappears so you only have elbow
there and I only got go any lower and

170
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:33,920
there and I only got go any lower and
 

171
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:43,170
there and I only got go any lower and
leave that there and then

172
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,180

 

173
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,719

and I lose no structural integrity

174
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:47,729
and I lose no structural integrity
 

175
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,210
and I lose no structural integrity
resisting his energy at the elbow by

176
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,220
resisting his energy at the elbow by
 

177
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,430
resisting his energy at the elbow by
doing that you see that you guys see

178
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
doing that you see that you guys see
 

179
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,860
doing that you see that you guys see
that himself I go like that

180
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:57,870

 

181
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,920

like that

182
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:00,930
like that
 

183
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,810
like that
see so to keep that we're gonna push

184
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:02,820
see so to keep that we're gonna push
 

185
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,180
see so to keep that we're gonna push
hard and push hard and I leave I leave

all that there okay

188
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
all that there okay
 

189
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,360
all that there okay
go see if you could tell me what the

190
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,370
go see if you could tell me what the
 

191
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:22,820
go see if you could tell me what the
difference between these two examples

192
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:22,830

 

193
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,490

that's example a Bashar

194
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:29,500

 

195
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,610

what is that

196
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:32,620

 

197
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,170

but okay B moves more freely a had more

198
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,180
but okay B moves more freely a had more
 

199
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,100
but okay B moves more freely a had more
tension in it right what's holding the

200
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,110
tension in it right what's holding the
 

201
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,090
tension in it right what's holding the
arm in place his push from what is it my

202
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,100
arm in place his push from what is it my
 

203
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,890
arm in place his push from what is it my
elbow what does this have to do with

204
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:46,900
elbow what does this have to do with
 

205
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,640
elbow what does this have to do with
anything

206
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:47,650
anything
 

207
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,090
anything
he's a nothing nothing to get it

208
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,100
he's a nothing nothing to get it
 

209
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,240
he's a nothing nothing to get it
so if I if I am keeping that in place

210
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,250

 

211
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,220

with and I have to go slow like that I'm

212
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,230
with and I have to go slow like that I'm
 

213
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,810
with and I have to go slow like that I'm
probably keeping it in place with this

214
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:00,820
probably keeping it in place with this
 

215
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,790

Oh same thing so we're here keep that
tight and I don't lose the structural

266
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,060
tight and I don't lose the structural
 

267
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,980
tight and I don't lose the structural
integrity but I create what's tell push

268
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:39,990
integrity but I create what's tell push
 

269
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:53,100
integrity but I create what's tell push
hard watch what's happening we shark

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,020
here's the thing we're down here like
this and this was not relevant

282
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,030
this and this was not relevant
 

283
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:34,950
this and this was not relevant

it stays not relevant it's here okay it
 

285
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,200
it stays not relevant it's here okay it
will become relevant if you lose the

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,210
will become relevant if you lose the
 

287
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,800
will become relevant if you lose the
elbow angle you're gonna have make down

288
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:40,810
elbow angle you're gonna have make down
 

289
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,370
elbow angle you're gonna have make down
this and this well I keep the elbow

290
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:44,380
this and this well I keep the elbow
 

291
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,950
this and this well I keep the elbow
angle right and I do this same thing you

292
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:49,960
angle right and I do this same thing you
 

293
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,440
angle right and I do this same thing you
guys see that

294
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,450

 

295
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:07,329

410 is a push it on your elbow elbow

here or someplace other than here it is
 

303
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,620
here or someplace other than here it is
because you change that that elbow angle

304
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,630
because you change that that elbow angle
 

305
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,960
because you change that that elbow angle
so you went you did something you see

306
