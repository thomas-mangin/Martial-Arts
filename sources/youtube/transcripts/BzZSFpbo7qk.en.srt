19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,750

this one you can use the body

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
this one you can use the body
 

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,510
this one you can use the body
and slide with it

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520

 

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,029

this would be seen in the kentai joe

24
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
this would be seen in the kentai joe
 

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,910
this would be seen in the kentai joe
when cytosensit shows you the the joe

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
when cytosensit shows you the the joe

00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
exercises
 

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,390

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,230

so you get very similar movements and

34
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
so you get very similar movements and
 

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,950
so you get very similar movements and
actions
