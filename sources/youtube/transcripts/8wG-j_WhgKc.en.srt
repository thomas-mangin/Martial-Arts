Marshall without the weapon shift turn

10
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:29,869
Marshall without the weapon shift turn
 

11
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:53,750
Marshall without the weapon shift turn
then shift turn let's try

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760

 

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,470

attack whoa then you have to in down ok

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,440
attack whoa then you have to in down ok
 

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:50,760
attack whoa then you have to in down ok
let's try

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:50,770

 

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:02:06,669

shift ten cards

00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:15,350

single pivot and that's all all I'm

26
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
single pivot and that's all all I'm
 

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,470
single pivot and that's all all I'm
working on is a single pivot point

28
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
working on is a single pivot point
 

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,530
working on is a single pivot point
single pivot point single pivot point

and now I'm going to start to 10.com

40
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:00,680
and now I'm going to start to 10.com
 

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,600
and now I'm going to start to 10.com
leaving it there you see a double pivot

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:08,610

 

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:18,470

and I won't translate into the internal

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
and I won't translate into the internal
 

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:28,960
and I won't translate into the internal
aspects and it is not marginal shift

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:35,939
functioning but your range is off so
I'll show you will do that if you go to

94
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:35,949
I'll show you will do that if you go to

you see I get out of range every time

118
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,530
you see I get out of range every time
 

119
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,120
you see I get out of range every time
okay so even if you couldn't double

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,130
okay so even if you couldn't double
 

121
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,409
okay so even if you couldn't double
pivot your my is gonna be off all right

what I'm doing is he's going that way I

152
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:13,220
what I'm doing is he's going that way I
 

153
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,240
what I'm doing is he's going that way I
move myself to the other side and I'm

going the same way he's going okay I get
 

157
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,040
going the same way he's going okay I get
into position

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,050
into position
 

159
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:29,020
into position
oh and now I have to do it again oh you

160
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,030
oh and now I have to do it again oh you
 

161
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,690
oh and now I have to do it again oh you
will get right into that same mistake if

162
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:31,700
will get right into that same mistake if
 

163
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,659
will get right into that same mistake if
you double pivot you can't get on the

so I move into the empty space and then

186
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:16,830
so I move into the empty space and then
 

187
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,780
so I move into the empty space and then
I repeat it again so I can go pretty

188
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,790
I repeat it again so I can go pretty
 

189
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:35,450
I repeat it again so I can go pretty
quick at no time am i pulling hit okay

190
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:35,460
quick at no time am i pulling hit okay
 

191
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,190
quick at no time am i pulling hit okay
that is incorrect

192
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
that is incorrect
 

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
that is incorrect

it's not not him pushing and then that's
how this happened

202
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:52,950
how this happened
 

203
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,040
how this happened
okay so you could kind of even pull okay

204
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,050
okay so you could kind of even pull okay
 

205
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,590
okay so you could kind of even pull okay
so he's gonna pull and I'm just gonna

206
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:00,600
so he's gonna pull and I'm just gonna
 

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,170
so he's gonna pull and I'm just gonna
bring his balance this way okay so as I

208
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,180
bring his balance this way okay so as I
 

209
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,390
bring his balance this way okay so as I
come in like this it's already making

210
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,400
come in like this it's already making
 

211
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,450
come in like this it's already making
him have to readjust you see and I am
