00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
Hello everybody first of all I'd like to
wish you all a very happy new year 2018.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,200
I hope that practice is as fruitful and
enjoyable as possible

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,720
and that you will remain in good health for the whole year.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm doing this video today, this kind of vlog thing,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,420
which is pretty unusual and as you
can probably tell,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm far more comfortable behind the camera than in front of it

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,160
but because 2017 been a such a big year

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,940
for the channel and that's you know 2018
looks pretty big as well,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,000
I thought it'd be in order to go through what happened last year

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,320
and perhaps talk a little bit about what is coming up for the year to come.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,380
2017 has been a good year for the channel,

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,620
it went through its 10th year of
existence (I've actually started in 2007)

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,100
and in 2017, we passed the 30,000th subscriber,

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,480
which is amazing considering that,

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,820
you know, Aikido is a kind of a niche
interest.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,280
It's unlikely to go much higher than that

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,920
because the content I do
is pretty specific,

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,380
it's very historical, very factual and I
wanted to stay like this.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,980
Indeed, I've received some advice from people, including from people from YouTube,

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,460
giving me advice on how to increase my viewership by
producing such and such type of content

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,000
but this is not going to happen because
the purpose of this channel is to be

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,300
the highest quality possible.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,720
I live it to other channels to do perhaps more popular content,

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,800
but that that's fine, I do what I do.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,900
So we've reached over 11 million views, which is quite a big thing.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,320
Since people had been asking me how to support the channel,

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,100
I have open crowdfunding accounts one on Patreon and one on Tipeee,

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,740
so the most helpful, of course,
is to contribute financially,

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,720
Give a dollar, or more, if you can spare it per month,

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,100
And all that money will be re-injected into buying gear,

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,940
funding travels to conduct these interviews, and all the logistical aspects of it,

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,600
because of course what's important to keep in mind is that

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,960
everything I do I do out of my own pocket, in my own time,

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,960
this is a hobby I'm not a professional I'm not on anyone's payroll,

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,780
and that's very good, as it is.

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,960
It gives me freedom to do what I want, freedom not to do what I don't want to do,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,920
and I'm basically putting most of the money myself

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,100
and counting a little bit on the ads that display at the bottom of the videos from YouTube to get me a little bit of money,

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,480
Patreon, even though it's not you know crazy successful, few people are donating

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,660
but I really appreciate the fact that those people actually decided to donate,

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,200
and some partnerships,

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,440
including the one with for example the International Aikido Federation

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,260
for which I'm Information Director

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,620
and of course IAF provides some logistical help

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,180
and sets up some contacts for me to do
what I do

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
and I provide an exchange some material for the Federation

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,780
so that's been working very well, especially with the new chairman, Kei Izawa,

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,020
he actually went as far as going with me to Iwama for example,

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,200
to conduct the interview with Isoyama Shihan.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,680
Talking about those interviews of course

51
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,780
some major interviews came out this
year,

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,360
the one with Isoyama Shihan, the one with Tada Shihan,

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,880
and something a little bit different, the interview with Akuzawa Shihan, from Aunkai,

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,740
I hope that you guys found those videos interesting,

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,520
on top of the usual Budokan and Kagamibiraki demonstrations.

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,220
Finally I'd like to talk a little bit about the content that's going to be published next year.

57
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,820
I've got an interview with a pretty prominent teacher

58
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,920
coming up probably January, or
worst case scenario, February,

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,620
and two more, at least, which I can't talk about right now

60
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,300
because we're still in discussions but that it's 80% - 90% chance of happening

61
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,920
and of course that's going to be published during the year so you can really look forward to new content,

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,580
high quality content, and the channel is
very much going to continue like that.

63
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,160
To finish I'd like to thank you all very
much for following this channel,

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,020
for your kind comments, for your support,
financially for those on Patreon and Tipeee,

65
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,660
thank you very very very much that means
a lot that helps a lot

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,480
and once again, I wish you a very happy new year 2018 and all the best,

67
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,980
and I'll see you on the tatami, bye.
