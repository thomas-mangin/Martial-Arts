because the only solution I can come up
 

7
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,890
because the only solution I can come up
with is that I haven't faster than they

faster start earlier well starting

154
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,610
faster start earlier well starting
 

155
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,740

earlier is going to be a matter of

156
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,750
earlier is going to be a matter of
 

157
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,610
earlier is going to be a matter of
exception and perception is going to be

158
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,620
exception and perception is going to be
 

159
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,960
exception and perception is going to be
a matter of relaxation so if I have a

160
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:33,970
a matter of relaxation so if I have a
 

161
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,410
a matter of relaxation so if I have a

right you get that right
so once physically you're in the

254
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:05,590
so once physically you're in the
 

255
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,860
so once physically you're in the
ballpark then that is how to approach

so don't rush it'll make the technique

276
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:42,099
so don't rush it'll make the technique
 

277
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,219
so don't rush it'll make the technique
so as I was watching you when you rushed

278
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:44,229
so as I was watching you when you rushed
 

279
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,350
so as I was watching you when you rushed
you started cutting on the side of your

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
you started cutting on the side of your
 

281
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,930
you started cutting on the side of your
head and as a result you have to not aim

282
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:48,940
head and as a result you have to not aim
 

283
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,510
head and as a result you have to not aim
because your body the center line of

because your body the center line of
 

285
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,719

you know in conjunction with that's not

288
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,030
you know in conjunction with that's not
 

289
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,689
you know in conjunction with that's not
a power line and you're not dominating

290
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:03,699
a power line and you're not dominating
 

291
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,570
a power line and you're not dominating
the center line now so both tactically

292
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:06,580
the center line now so both tactically
 

293
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,270
the center line now so both tactically
and biomechanically it's an inferior

294
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
and biomechanically it's an inferior
 

295
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:31,220
and biomechanically it's an inferior

in the reactivity via our fears we have
 

305
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,550
in the reactivity via our fears we have
a resistance to what's happening and

a resistance to what's happening and
 

307
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,430
a resistance to what's happening and
that resistance usually manifests itself

308

that resistance usually manifests itself
 

309
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,470
that resistance usually manifests itself
in ways that we would described as
