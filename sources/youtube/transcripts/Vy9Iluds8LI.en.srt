so this hand has to move

124
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:34,379
so this hand has to move
 

125
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,729
so this hand has to move

technically spiritually whatever you
need to enter

128
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:40,739
need to enter
 

129
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,430
need to enter
if that moves so must that move

130
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
if that moves so must that move
 

131
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,140
if that moves so must that move
so it's collapsed but in a nice way
