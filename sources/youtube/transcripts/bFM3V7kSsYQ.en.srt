00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
so instead i'm using a yielding
 

239
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,830
so instead i'm using a yielding
technique around his hand so you keep it

240
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
technique around his hand so you keep it
 

241
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,629
technique around his hand so you keep it
up do you see how i keep it up then it's
