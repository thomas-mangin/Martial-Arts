I so if I could get Josh to come in here

36
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,140
I so if I could get Josh to come in here
 

37
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,290
I so if I could get Josh to come in here
with me okay

38
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,300

 

39
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,080

so if we're both here in your mind and I

40
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,090
so if we're both here in your mind and I
 

41
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,849
so if we're both here in your mind and I
need to launch an attack if I'm

42
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:58,859
need to launch an attack if I'm
 

43
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,610
need to launch an attack if I'm
launching a thrust I don't need any prep

44
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:01,620
launching a thrust I don't need any prep
 

45
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,009
launching a thrust I don't need any prep
interaction which means I can attack by

46
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:04,019
interaction which means I can attack by
 

47
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,370
interaction which means I can attack by
just entering in if I'm going to launch

48
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:07,380
just entering in if I'm going to launch
 

49
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,469
just entering in if I'm going to launch
some kind of thrust or chop or something

50
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
some kind of thrust or chop or something
 

51
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,240
some kind of thrust or chop or something
like that I'm gonna have to prepare the

52
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,250
like that I'm gonna have to prepare the
 

53
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,670
like that I'm gonna have to prepare the
action first and this means that he it's

54
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
action first and this means that he it's
 

55
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,380
action first and this means that he it's
a moment of time where he can do

56
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
a moment of time where he can do
 

57
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,780
a moment of time where he can do
something right so every time I set my

58
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:17,790
something right so every time I set my
 

59
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,850
something right so every time I set my
strike first Josh will be acting in that

60
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:19,860
strike first Josh will be acting in that
 

61
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,890
strike first Josh will be acting in that
moment so if he's right on it and I'm

62
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
moment so if he's right on it and I'm
 

63
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,840
moment so if he's right on it and I'm
raising my strike up he can enter into

64
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:23,850
raising my strike up he can enter into
 

65
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,999
raising my strike up he can enter into
that space and get me so that's an

66
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,009
that space and get me so that's an
 

67
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,230
that space and get me so that's an
important thing you have to understand

68
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,240
important thing you have to understand
 

69
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,140
important thing you have to understand
is that anytime you're launching a

70
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,150
is that anytime you're launching a
 

71
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,609
is that anytime you're launching a
clothing attack then you have to prepare

72
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:31,619
clothing attack then you have to prepare
 

73
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,039
clothing attack then you have to prepare

00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,049
the action now one way I can kind of
 

75
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,170
the action now one way I can kind of
work around that is if I go up into Joe

76
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,180
work around that is if I go up into Joe
 

77
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,330
work around that is if I go up into Joe

while setting you're on can't mine but

152
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,680
while setting you're on can't mine but
 

153
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,530
while setting you're on can't mine but
what's really nice about this is if he

154
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:06,540
what's really nice about this is if he
 

155
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,780
what's really nice about this is if he
chooses to chase me when I do this but

156
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:08,790
chooses to chase me when I do this but
 

157
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,640
chooses to chase me when I do this but
yet the action is immediately right

158
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:10,650
yet the action is immediately right
 

159
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,440
yet the action is immediately right
there to come in and attack so Joe

160
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,450
there to come in and attack so Joe
 

161
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,199
there to come in and attack so Joe
continued my is setting up the cutting

162
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,209
continued my is setting up the cutting
 

163
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,780
continued my is setting up the cutting
action ahead of time so that way I don't

164
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:17,790
action ahead of time so that way I don't
 

165
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,490
action ahead of time so that way I don't
have to have a preparatory action right

166
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:19,500
have to have a preparatory action right
 

167
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,920
have to have a preparatory action right
so it's kind of a way to cheat that rule

168
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:21,930
so it's kind of a way to cheat that rule
 

169
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,259
so it's kind of a way to cheat that rule
that I talked about before if I'm going

170
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:24,269
that I talked about before if I'm going
 

171
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,150
that I talked about before if I'm going
in to get on Kenny my what's happening

172
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,160
in to get on Kenny my what's happening
 

173
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,330
in to get on Kenny my what's happening
is I'm removing my obvious defense

174
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,340
is I'm removing my obvious defense
 

175
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,059
is I'm removing my obvious defense
so what I feel like this I'm removing my

176
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,069
so what I feel like this I'm removing my
 

177
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,759
so what I feel like this I'm removing my
obvious defense which means to Josh I

178
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:36,769
obvious defense which means to Josh I
 

179
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,559
obvious defense which means to Josh I
look like I'm pretty much set up for

180
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:38,569
look like I'm pretty much set up for
 

181
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,259
look like I'm pretty much set up for
attack so yeah I was slight data rate

182
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:41,269
attack so yeah I was slight data rate
 

183
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,780
attack so yeah I was slight data rate

if jobs are to attack me I can move to

188

if jobs are to attack me I can move to
 

189
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,070

the side this way you come in there's
 

191
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,420
the side this way you come in there's
lots of ways that can set up an attack

192
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,430
lots of ways that can set up an attack
 

193
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,220
lots of ways that can set up an attack
from gate on but basically what data

194
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,230
from gate on but basically what data
 

195
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,160
from gate on but basically what data
does is it draws them in so I came out

196
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,170
does is it draws them in so I came out
 

197
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,509
does is it draws them in so I came out
of range a little bit so that way you

198
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
of range a little bit so that way you
 

199
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,740
of range a little bit so that way you
couldn't attack me while I was dropping

200
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,750
couldn't attack me while I was dropping
 

201
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,690
couldn't attack me while I was dropping
my sword and then as I start to push

00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:58,700
my sword and then as I start to push
 

203
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,970
my sword and then as I start to push
into that rank I'm set up for action

204
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:00,980
into that rank I'm set up for action
 

205
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,600
into that rank I'm set up for action
immediately I can also move it so it

206
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:04,610
immediately I can also move it so it
 

207

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,909
because he gives me maximum offense and
defense at the same time if I was

318
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
defense at the same time if I was

322
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:58,889
defensive and they had a good defense
 

323
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,080
defensive and they had a good defense
but I felt like their offense wasn't

324
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,090
but I felt like their offense wasn't
 

325
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,820
but I felt like their offense wasn't
that good I'd probably go indicate on

326
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:01,830
that good I'd probably go indicate on
 

327
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,770
that good I'd probably go indicate on
because gait on my lure them in not get

probably try to get into Joe Don so that

335
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,089
probably try to get into Joe Don so that
way I would be threatening them back and

336
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:11,099
way I would be threatening them back and
 

337
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,680
way I would be threatening them back and
kind of pushing them back so someone had

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,690
kind of pushing them back so someone had
 

339
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,060
kind of pushing them back so someone had
a really strong offense I would probably

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,070
a really strong offense I would probably
 

341
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,860
a really strong offense I would probably
line up in it in a Joe Don but that's

line up in it in a Joe Don but that's
