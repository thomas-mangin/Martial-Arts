what a lot of people try and do is they

and they move the
the hand

34
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
the hand
 

35
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,630
the hand
like the hand sticks to it and they go

36
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
like the hand sticks to it and they go
 

37
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,110
like the hand sticks to it and they go
like that if you do that

like that if you do that
the other hand is pinned to the other

40
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
the other hand is pinned to the other
 

41
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,430
the other hand is pinned to the other
knee

42
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
knee
 

43
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,590
knee
so i can't get it over to do anything

44
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
so i can't get it over to do anything
 

45
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,630
so i can't get it over to do anything
else

46
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640

 

47
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,709

the intent a little bit easier the

48
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
the intent a little bit easier the
 

49
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,830
the intent a little bit easier the
intention is as i take the knee away

50
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
intention is as i take the knee away
 

51
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,389
intention is as i take the knee away
to come on top of that wrist drop it

52
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
to come on top of that wrist drop it
 

53
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,430
to come on top of that wrist drop it
down

54
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
down
 

55
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,029
down
roll it

56
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
roll it
 

57
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,270
roll it
like i'm rolling a rolling pin

58
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
like i'm rolling a rolling pin
 

59
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,910
like i'm rolling a rolling pin
so this is a lot this is why again i

60
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
so this is a lot this is why again i
 

61
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,830
so this is a lot this is why again i
like psycho scentsy because his logic

62
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
like psycho scentsy because his logic
 

63
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,590
like psycho scentsy because his logic
works

64
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
works
 

65
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,469
works
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking

66
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking
 

67
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,070
if i do that what am i doing i'm taking
it further away

68
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
it further away
 

69
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,109
it further away
from my hands to get it

70
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
from my hands to get it
 

71
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,550
from my hands to get it
so logic tells you why would you do that

72
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
so logic tells you why would you do that
 

73
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,789
so logic tells you why would you do that
you actually need it to be closer rather

74
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
you actually need it to be closer rather
 

75
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,870
you actually need it to be closer rather
than further away

76
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
than further away
 

77
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,030
than further away
so this is another don't go backwards to

78
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
so this is another don't go backwards to
 

79
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,070
so this is another don't go backwards to
go forwards because if you're going to

80
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
go forwards because if you're going to
 

81
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,149
go forwards because if you're going to
go all that way to there you might not

82
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
go all that way to there you might not
 

83
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,469
go all that way to there you might not
make it

84
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
make it
 

85
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,630
make it
so you're all going to not all of you

86
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
so you're all going to not all of you
 

87
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,109
so you're all going to not all of you
but most of you're going to do it wrong

88
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
but most of you're going to do it wrong
 

89
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,550
but most of you're going to do it wrong
because that's

90
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
because that's
 

91
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,910
because that's
how we are

92
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
how we are
 

93
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,830
how we are
we don't quite get the timeline you've

94
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
we don't quite get the timeline you've
 

95
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,429
we don't quite get the timeline you've
got to take the foot away

96
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
got to take the foot away
 

97
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,510
got to take the foot away
that leg away

98
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
that leg away
 

99
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,950
that leg away
turn that hand down there

100
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
turn that hand down there
 

101
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,550
turn that hand down there
and instead of doing that

102
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
and instead of doing that
 

103
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,109
and instead of doing that
you see are we getting are we getting

104
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
you see are we getting are we getting
 

105
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,749
you see are we getting are we getting
the message now about this

106
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759

 

107
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,990

all right

108
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000

 

109
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,190

so it should if it doesn't

110
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
so it should if it doesn't
 

111
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,710
so it should if it doesn't
you know they're machines when you go

112
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
you know they're machines when you go
 

113
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,350
you know they're machines when you go

128
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
so this doesn't really much need to be
 

129
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,990
so this doesn't really much need to be
in there

130
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000

this was his

136
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
this was his
 

137
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,910
this was his
about 100

138
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
about 100
 

139
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,229
about 100
favorite technique

140
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
favorite technique
 

141
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,750
favorite technique
so

142
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
so
 

143
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,070
so
it turns

144
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
it turns
 

145
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,270
it turns
goes down

146
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
goes down
 

147
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,390
goes down
or else you're going to hurt your own

148
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
or else you're going to hurt your own
 

149
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,430
or else you're going to hurt your own
hand this one at the same time would

150
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
hand this one at the same time would
 

151
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,430
hand this one at the same time would
have been on top of that and there's a

152
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
have been on top of that and there's a
 

153
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,910
have been on top of that and there's a
small gap here and that last part

154
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
small gap here and that last part
 

155
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,869
small gap here and that last part
rolls him down

156
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879

 

157
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,589

so this is that piece of cake that you

158
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
so this is that piece of cake that you
 

159
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,470
so this is that piece of cake that you
you all had out of the cake

160
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
you all had out of the cake
 

161
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,149
you all had out of the cake
all right this is the things you need so

162
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
all right this is the things you need so
 

163
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,910
all right this is the things you need so
it's

164
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
it's
 

165
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,670
it's
so you don't really need this but if you

166
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
so you don't really need this but if you
 

167
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,190
so you don't really need this but if you
do

168
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
do
 

169
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,830
do
you roll them away you don't push them

170
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
