1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
You just published a new book "Morihei Ueshiba - Presence and Message" for the editions Guy Tredaniel Editeur

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,510
Before you started Aikido, you were already interested in other practices, including Judo,

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,940
how did you get from one to the other?

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,440
My journey was quite lengthy.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,770
I started at the age of 17.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,590
In the attic of my father, I found a book on the Sandow bodybuilding method,

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:36,330
and since I was not very big, I thought that having muscles would avoid me getting beaten by the of the kids at school.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:46,190
So I bulked up. Later I opened a fitness club and a physiotherapy cabinet in AngoulÃªme.

9
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:56,980
I then met the master Kawaishi, founder of French Judo, and I immediately started Judo.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,310
How did you get from Judo to Aikido?

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:08,900
I had developed Judo throughout the all South West of France when a Japanese instructor called Minoru Mochizuki arrived in France.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,720
In what he was doing, there were no more grabs and no prearranged stances.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,160
You know that in Judo, there are prearranged moves, and that we hold each other.

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,660
I thought that if someone attacked you in the street and that you grabbed, it would not be very good.

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,430
I therefore considered that Judo and Aikido practiced together could lead to something very complete.

16
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,380
Where did you hear about Aikido first, from your readings, or from a demonstration?

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:46,640
At the arrival in France of Minoru Mochizuki, who had been invited by the founder of French Judo, master Kawaishi.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
When I saw this man at work, and I immediately enrolled in his classes.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,140
Did this discipline look like it was the right thing for you?

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,150
I found it really remarkable.

21
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,490
Movements were very round, very beautiful, and the falls were not slapped on the ground.

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,340
I consider that Judo is a great sport but Aikido is something different, and but both fit well together.

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,540
Professor Jigoro Kano, the creator of Judo was a friend of Ueshiba.

24
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,500
When he saw Ueshiba at work he said: "That is my ideal Budo". He greatly admired him.

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,900
What is Budo?

26
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,170
I actually asked what Budo meant to a monk in Kamakura.

27
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,560
DO, and this is the way, and BU means stopping the sword, which means, to make peace.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,240
I read books in English that spoke of the aggressive spirit of the Japanese.

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,410
This is not true at all, there is no aggression, we seek peace in martial arts, we try not to fight.

30
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,320
You went to Japan in 1950-55 right?

31
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,770
I went to Japan under the advice of Tadashi Abe, the second Aikido master who came to Europe.

32
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:05,160
He told me "you are so fond of Aikido that you should see the founder Master Ueshiba".

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,790
I said: "hang on, I have a club Bordeaux with 300 students, I cannot leave like that".

34
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,630
I thought about it for months, wondering what to do.

35
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,090
At this time, you were still teaching physical education?

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,130
No, only Judo, I have taught all the teachers in Southwest, from Poitier to Biarritz.

37
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,160
You spent three years in Japan right?

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:41,290
I went for three years under the guidance of Mr. Duhamel of the French Academy, who was a friend of my family.

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,580
He told me "You must not take the plane, Asia must be earned in small steps."

40
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,740
You took the maritime mail boat.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,680
Yes, the ship was the "Laos", I was in fourth class.

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,470
Were you alone?

43
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,320
Yes I was alone in fourth class but I taught some Ju-jutsu techniques to the officers,

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,980
and in return, when it was too hot, they gave me a first class cabin, which was very nice of them.

45
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,410
It took a month to get there.

46
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,090
How was your arrival in Japan, you did not speak Japanese did you?

47
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,780
I do not speak Japanese, English is the language of business, and most Japanese speak English.

48
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:26,370
So I did ok with the English had I learned at school, there was no problem.

49
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,270
Master Ueshiba did not speak English, how did you communicate with him?

50
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:35,710
He spoke only Japanese, but with such a master, there is no need to speak, the teaching is from mind to mind.

51
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,110
This is what you call Ishin-Denshin?

52
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,910
Ishin-Denshin, that is it.

53
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:48,390
You did not need to speak with Ueshiba. He said once: "It is not easy to get Aikido into the head of Nocquet".

54
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,120
How did you understand what he said?

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,430
Via my interpreter.

56
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,480
So I asked how I was going to learn Aikido.

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:12,970
He replied, "I'll teach him when he sleeps, because then he can not say anything and I can more easily penetrate his mind".

58
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,290
When you got to Master Ueshiba's dojo in Tokyo, were you the only foreigner?

59
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:30,930
Yes I was the first in the world to have been invited directly by Master Ueshiba in his own family.

60
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,750
You lived with his family?

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:41,530
I was eating with the master and sleeping on the floor. The food was frugal, a lot of rice and fish.

62
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:51,700
I sometimes got giant urticaria because of the fish. The master would blow in my face and the next day it was gone. Funny isn't it?

63
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,250
How did he behave in intimacy? Was he someone who knows intimacy or was he always the same regardless of the circumstances?

64
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,660
In private, Ueshiba believed that all men, all his students, were his own sons.

65
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,530
Were there other students who stayed with him?

66
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,330
There were many Americans who came but they did not sleep at the dojo, they came every now and then, sporadically.

67
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:21,690
I was sleeping on the floor, waking up at 5 a.m. to clean the dojo with master Tamura.

68
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,660
He now also teaches in France.

69
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,950
Yes Noro Masamichi too, they were my favorites partners.

70
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:38,060
We were in the dojo for 1h in the morning and after the master would arrive and begin the lesson. We trained 5h a day.

71
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,540
It was a bit of a hell for a Westerner like me, it was really hard.

72
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,950
The pace was different?

73
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:58,750
The pace was different because the Japanese practice Aikido in a manner that is different from Europeans because we are influenced by Descartes.

74
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,630
We want to understand before doing something.

75
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,040
The Japanese do not not, they have a global mind.

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,960
We practice the same movements for hours and hours,

77
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,880
it frees the mind and it is transmitted to the body, it is the Zen aspect of Aikido.

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,580
The Japanese man practices, and when he has practiced a movement a thousand times,

79
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,060
the mind is completely gone, it's over, and the body takes over.

80
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,690
Whereas in Europe, we show a movement that the students practice,

81
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,990
and all of a sudden they want to see another movement, and then another.

82
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,830
They do not understand much that way.

83
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:45,400
You mentioned the Zen in Aikido, can you summarize the personal and spiritual journey of Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido?

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,950
Master Ueshiba was a man who could not walk until he was seven years old, he was very frail.

85
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,980
So he wanted to become strong, because he was also quite small.

86
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,810
I'm not a very tall man but he was ten centimeters shorter than me, about 1m55, no more.

87
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,400
Gradually, through certain movements, he became stronger and stronger.

88
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:20,030
In order to learn dodging, some students used to throw stones or beets at him, and he was trying to avoid all that.

89
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,600
This is how Tai Sabaki was born.

90
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:32,730
But the way of Ueshiba, not the spiritual route, but the physical one, was that he met many masters.

91
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,980
In Hokkaido, for example?

92
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,540
Yes, Hokkaido, but before that he went to many dojos. We wandered around

93
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:48,670
and when he saw a master at work, he immediately challenged him to see if he could beat him.

94
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,520
He beat a lot of them and used to say: "I have nothing to learn from people I beat".

95
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,760
One day in Hokkaido, he met a teacher named Takeda.

96
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,280
It was behind an inn, in a small room,

97
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,860
he was very surprised to see that he [Takeda] was doing a lot of dodging.

98
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,870
How could he know that it was a master?

99
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:17,230
He had been told.

100
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,920
He saw his work and asked him immediately if he could fight against him.

101
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:33,400
Then, something extraordinary happened, the small body of Ueshiba was thrown around sixty times in a few minutes.

102
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,020
He had found his master and began to work with him.

103
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:46,920
Takeda took him as student, but he taught him less than 5 minutes per day.

104
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,370
The rest of the day, he had to wash his master and prepare his meals.

105
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:01,110
This is Japan, you do not pay, but you have to give of yourself to the master. It does not happen in Europe.

106
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,490
Today, even though you are yourself a master of Aikido, you do not convey the same education system right?

107
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,040
I have been taught in the traditional Japanese way but I try to transcend that,

108
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,050
to do what is called ecumenism in religion.

109
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:22,080
I try to the merge the Japanese teaching with Cartesianism, but it is not easy.

110
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,730
Going back to Ueshiba's journey, I think that he met someone from the Omoto sect.

111
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,890
Yes he did many things, he went to Manchuria, he fought at war, he might even have killed, there were a lot of things.

112
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:42,860
He was too short to do his military service,

113
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,780
but he wrote letters in blood to the emperor and was able to do it after that.

114
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,070
Ueshiba was an extraordinary man.

115
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:57,640
Then he met at the Omoto-kyo a man named [Deguchi] who spoke of the principle of love between humans.

116
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,810
That surprised a lot and delighted him.

117
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,180
His Aikido is a bit of that, but not completely.

118
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:16,770
During a snowstorm in Hokkaido, his master became a little mad.

119
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:24,040
He said: "Ueshiba, go out in the storm, there is an enemy waiting for me".

120
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,330
Ueshiba went out, but saw nothing.

121
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,860
Takeda said: "I know he is there".

122
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,590
This is because Takeda had killed men.

123
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,360
It was still the age of chivalry, almost medieval.

124
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:46,880
Ueshiba said: "if the Budo created by my master requires to kill, it is not true Budo".

125
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,280
For him, a true Budo is the love of all people, not to kill anyone, but to control men, that's all.

126
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,530
Aikido is born this day through that feeling in that snowstorm in Hokkaido.

127
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,590
I have a very important article that I could publish one day.

128
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,320
It is by another Japanese master, but I'm not sure I can publish it.

129
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,760
Ueshiba created Aikido in 1922 didn't he?

130
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,180
He created Aikido through different stages,

131
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,770
one can not create something like Aikido in one step, it is imposible.

132
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,770
It is a journey.

133
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:42,090
Yes a journey. There are French masters who prefer the Aikido practiced by Ueshiba when it was very hard, square techniques,

134
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,770
even though the master was working in a very round way at the end of his life.

135
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:53,500
There is a path that the master took. There is always a path in everything we do.

136
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,550
So it may be that in fact, Aikido was born at the death of Ueshiba.

137
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:10,000
Aikido was born, not at his death, but when he was about 75 years old.

138
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,670
It was at about the same time, in 1959 I believe, that Aikido began to spread outside of Japan.

139
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,880
Yes, Aikido developed because the Japanese sent many teachers to different parts of the world.

140
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,390
I arrived in France in early 1959, after having taught in the United States for a while, to the police.

141
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,850
I got there, I was alone.

142
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,910
Master Tamura came in 1964.

143
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,180
Another Japanese expert called Masamichi Noro,

144
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:56,750
also very strong in Aikido, came, but he has since developed a slightly different approach called Kinomichi.

145
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,020
Kinomichi has very beautiful movements, but this is not the actual teaching of Ueshiba.

146
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:09,920
We can say that it is Tamura, who I work with, and who was my partner in Tokyo.

147
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,130
He made me suffer a lot when I was in Tokyo.

148
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:22,520
We worked out for an whole hour and sometimes, my shoulders would hurt a bit as a result.

149
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:31,370
How can we define exactly Aikido? Going back to Japanese Kanji, DO is the way, and AIKI is the search for harmony?

150
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:38,530
The Japanese master, during his youth, practiced many Japanese and extreme oriental martial arts.

151
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:48,620
This allowed him to realize that most of them were aimed at destroying the enemy's aggression by destroying the enemy himself.

152
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:59,560
This finding led him to think that there was a deficiency: the mental basis of these martial arts was violence.

153
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:09,740
The big idea of the master was to destroy the aggressiveness of the opponent via making him feel that it was useless

154
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:19,040
This whole idea of non-aggression towards each other is part of an overall perspective of the universe itself, the origin of which happens to be explained in Aikido

155
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:29,440
when he explains the origin of matter and Ki, but yet you are telling in your book "Morihei Ueshiba, Presence and Message" that Aikido is not a religion.

156
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,250
No, Aikido is not a religion.

157
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:43,680
One day I asked master Ueshiba: "You always say that Aikido is Love, isn't there a very narrow link with Christianity? "

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:52,340
He told me: "Yes, there is but if you go to Europe, never say that Aikido is a religion".

159
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,600
"If you practice Aikido well, you may become a better Christian"

160
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,530
"but if a good Buddhist practices Aikido, he will also become a better Buddhist."

161
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:11,830
Aikido is a way, it helps to better understand religions and philosophies, but it is not a religion.

162
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,240
What is the influence of Zen in the foundation and the spirit of Aikido?

163
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,490
It is very simple, Ueshiba has always said that Aikido is Zen in action.

164
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:28,220
It is obvious that this is true because we work in the moment, in the instant

165
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,720
so there is an economy of gesture,

166
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,490
while in a sport such as Judo, we are working in time, there is an effort in time.

167
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,280
For us Aikidoka, there is an effort in the moment, and in the moment, we do not get tired.

168
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:51,950
Besides, you also say in your book that Aikido can help the warrior to wield his sword, but also the musician his bow, the architect his compass, the poet his pen, the painter his brush.

169
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:58,620
Yes I wrote that but it did not come to me spontaneously, I wrote it and rewrote it, with time.

170
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,840
You talk about spiritual alertness, is the goal of Aikido to reach and refine this vigilance?

171
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:14,870
At the beginning, we should not really practice philosophy.

172
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,450
Do not make it a spiritual quest.

173
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:23,450
We must watch the body, and perform many movements without thinking of this spiritual quest.

174
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:34,790
Master Ueshiba said: "Aikido is 95% perspiration and 5% philosophy." By saying that, I have said everything.

175
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:43,290
It means that it takes a lot practice, and once you have reached a third or fourth Dan grade in Aikido,

176
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,180
you can begin to address the spiritual aspect.

177
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,650
I was often reading at Ueshiba's dojo, but the master told me:

178
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:58,000
"No, Mr. Nocquet, do not read, you have to practice more with your body, you do not practice enough."

179
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,690
I told him that I was tired, and he said: "It is meaningless for an Aikidoka to talk about being tired, tiredness does not exist."

180
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,040
It took me a lot of time to write this book "Presence and Message".

181
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:25,370
You were in Japan in the years 1955-1959 and this book is now out in 1988,
so this is really the result of a lifetime of study isn't it?

182
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,520
Yes, it is the fruit of a lifetime, and the next book I'll do, I'll call it the "Heart and Sword",

183
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,400
because when I left Japan my teacher told me: "project your heart rather than your sword."

184
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:47,820
It is very important to project the heart, and we know that there is mediation between the heart and the mind.

185
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,240
I discussed it with doctors and they told me "what you say is very symbolic,"

186
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,840
but I told them that it was from Claude Bernard, the great 19th century physiologist

187
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:09,340
who showed strong evidence that the heart, body and mind, the brain, are together.

188
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,620
The East understands this much better than the West.

189
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:20,640
Oh yes. A man, if he has only the brain in action, will slice the flesh, he will sometimes be wicked and evil

190
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:28,270
but as soon as the heart does mediation, works with him, the man becomes good. This is why Aikido is a matter of the heart.

191
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,940
You say that Aikido training is not only psychological, but it is a training of the whole person.

192
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:49,290
For me, the psychology Aikido is to defeat the other before the other defeats us, to anticipate movements.

193
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,540
Besides the opponent in Aikido is simply a relative strength, it is not an absolute opponent.

194
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,910
There is no opponent,

195
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:07,400
if a man attacks, I consider that the man is inscribed in a sphere, as represented by Leonardo daVinci.

196
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,120
When the two spheres collide, it is Judo, because we hold each other.

197
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,190
It does not happen in Aikido because we don't hold each other,

198
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,710
so both my sphere and my partner's are tangential.

199
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,240
So Aikido is the art of tangential action.

200
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,790
There is a beautiful picture to understand Aikido: imagine a spider's web.

201
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:39,410
This web is a circle and the spider stands in the center, waiting.

202
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:47,270
Me too, in my circle, I wait, and when someone walks into it, I can act.

203
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,400
I must wait until another attacks and gets into my circle.

204
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,480
This is an individual practice.

205
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,740
Yes it is an individual practice, then, I turn around the opponent

206
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,440
and in the principle of non-opposition, Yin and Yang become complementary.

207
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,380
This is what people should understand.

208
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,700
You say that in France and the United States, in particular,

209
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,120
there are some mistakes in the approach of Aikido as it is seen a self-defense, while for you, it is not that at all.

210
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,060
Aikido is an excellent self-defense.

211
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,340
But it's not only that.

212
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,010
No it's not only that, but it is clear that in the street, if we are attacked, we can defend ourselves

213
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,660
because there are still some atemi, which are strikes that can be used.

214
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,060
It is not easy to make love with a man who has a weapon.

215
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:40,550
Aikido is Love but if a man attacks with a knife, he can kill you,

216
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,740
so you must disarm him, then it is ok to strike a blow in vital areas that do not result in death.

217
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,720
I love training with weapons.

218
00:21:52,730 --> 00:22:00,830
If a man has a gun, a knife, or a sword, I still consider weapons as an extension of the arm.

219
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,950
I don't set my mind on the weapon.

220
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,020
I see the whole man, and do not look at what he has in his hand.

221
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,250
The movement...

222
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,250
Yes, the whole movement. Aikido is very beautiful; young boys and women can practice it,

223
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,470
because the falls are not brutal.

224
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:26,120
More and more people practice, even if it does not grow as fast as Judo or Karate because there is no competition.

225
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,730
There is no competition possible in Aikido.

226
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,950
How is this teaching of Aikido being transmitted? By disciples?

227
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,680
I have a lot of followers in France and Western Europe,

228
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,440
I formed the European Aikido Union, there were about eleven nations

229
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,550
and amongst my best students, there are French people of course,

230
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,570
but the most faithful, and those I love the most, are the Germans.

231
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,470
It is funny my dear lady, I am a former prisoner of war,

232
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,470
I fought against the Germans, and now I teach them Aikido, it is beautiful.

233
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,350
I teach men where there was war, and now there is no more war.

234
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,950
The other day I said to a German student: "if there was another war between us, what would you do?"

235
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,250
I said it to Rolf Brand, who is the president:

236
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,910
"I have a gun and you have a gun, and we meet, there is a war between the two nations".

237
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,200
He answered: "we put down our guns and we go do the movements of Aikido".

238
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,270
I was very happy, it is great don't you think?

239
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,680
Love has no boundaries.

240
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,510
In your book, you also talk of a hidden meaning of training, what do you mean?

241
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:49,410
Hidden meaning... it is not easy to explain;

242
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,600
Aikido is practiced but not explained.

243
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,280
It takes much practice of Aikido to understand the practice,

244
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,190
but words do not work, they are useless.

245
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:08,960
The hidden meaning is to overcome our aggressive nature, a lot of things in us that are bad.

246
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,490
Is there a selection in the students who enter the dojo?

247
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,820
No there is no selection.

248
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:28,270
Students learn little by little. In general, people who are beginners are always taught by more advanced people, black belt, 1st or 2nd Dan.

249
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,750
We take care of beginners like that, little by little.

250
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,400
There is a path, and it changes every ten years or so.

251
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,370
A man, at the end of ten years, has realized something.

252
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,190
I once asked Ueshiba "Master, can I ask you a question?

253
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,270
He looked at me and said: "I cannot answer your question because you are not ready to understand".

254
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,980
I asked him when I would be ready and he said: "I will decide that myself."

255
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,750
After two years, he taught me that thing I could not understand at first.

256
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:07,310
To receive his teaching, you had to have an empty mind.

257
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:18,070
He said one day: "your cup is full of coffee, empty the coffee and let me pour my tea in it."

258
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:24,000
I think he wanted a renewal of ideas because there was another thing he said that went:

259
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,830
"if a cup is always full, the water stagnates, and for the water to be fresh, it must be emptied regularly,"

260
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,670
and "if your ears resound with the sound of your own voice, how can you hear the divine harmonies?"

261
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,150
This is a really good quote that I did not even know.

262
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,030
Do you think that the West can access this knowledge with no critical thinking?

263
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:50,380
Yes I think that gradually Aikido could be united in the spirit that we are talking about now

264
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:59,690
and I hope that the world, and the world of Aikido will see a real unification. It's coming.

265
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:08,160
The Doshu, who is the son of Master Ueshiba, is coming to France on March 31st to teach a seminar in Paris.

266
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:16,990
I think he will make a speech on friendship, because the most important thing in Aikido is to develop friendship.
