00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,620
same time there are functions to tighten
 

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,560
same time there are functions to tighten
and we do need to know how to do it for

20
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:36,570
and we do need to know how to do it for
 

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,900

so how do you build up the height balls

44
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:00,809
so how do you build up the height balls
 

45
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,389
so how do you build up the height balls
the first thing you have to be able to

46
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
the first thing you have to be able to
 

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,750
the first thing you have to be able to
do is do a successful forward roll wall

48
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
do is do a successful forward roll wall
 

49
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,340
do is do a successful forward roll wall
close to somebody so there's the first

50
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,350
close to somebody so there's the first
 

51
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,500
close to somebody so there's the first
step you have to have and then you need

52
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:09,510
step you have to have and then you need
 

53
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,240
step you have to have and then you need
to be able to do a forward roll while

54
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,250
to be able to do a forward roll while
 

55
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,130
to be able to do a forward roll while
someone's in contact with you and that

56
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,140
someone's in contact with you and that
 

57
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,170
someone's in contact with you and that
might sound easy but until you've done

58
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,180
might sound easy but until you've done
 

59
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,730
might sound easy but until you've done
it there's a lot of obstacles you can

60
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:16,740
it there's a lot of obstacles you can
 

61
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,920
it there's a lot of obstacles you can
hit with that so I have a rolling

62
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:18,930
hit with that so I have a rolling
 

63
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,080
hit with that so I have a rolling
progression that I use but just real

64
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,090
progression that I use but just real
 

65
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,060
progression that I use but just real
quick give you the rough idea of it is

66
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
quick give you the rough idea of it is
 

67
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,980
quick give you the rough idea of it is
so if Josh and I were like this here

68
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,990
so if Josh and I were like this here
 

69
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,100
so if Josh and I were like this here
we're really close to proximity I touch

70
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,110
we're really close to proximity I touch
 

71
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,929
we're really close to proximity I touch
Josh so that way I'm in contact with it

72
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:29,939
Josh so that way I'm in contact with it
 

73
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,490
Josh so that way I'm in contact with it
and then Josh does a nice board roll

74
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,500
and then Josh does a nice board roll
 

75
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,590
and then Josh does a nice board roll
okay so if once he can do that then you

76
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
okay so if once he can do that then you
 

77
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,999
okay so if once he can do that then you
can start to work up the high falls

78
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,009
can start to work up the high falls
 

79
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,620
can start to work up the high falls
really easy okay it's important to

80
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,630
really easy okay it's important to
 

81
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,030
really easy okay it's important to
understand that high Falls are called

82
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040
understand that high Falls are called
 

83
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,770
understand that high Falls are called

really not much different than simple

90
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,500
really not much different than simple

chi 10 except you turn all the way over

92
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
chi 10 except you turn all the way over
 

93
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,330
chi 10 except you turn all the way over
when you do it before touching the

94
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,340
when you do it before touching the
 

95
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,859
when you do it before touching the
ground so you don't touch the ground you

96
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:51,869
ground so you don't touch the ground you
 

97
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,719
ground so you don't touch the ground you
float past the ground and flip over the

98
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:53,729
float past the ground and flip over the
 

99
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,920
float past the ground and flip over the
way over to all the way over to the

100
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:54,930
way over to all the way over to the
 

101
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,810
way over to all the way over to the
other side so here's a nice progression

102
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:56,820
other side so here's a nice progression
 

103
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,850
other side so here's a nice progression
for that so if Josh and I were to stand

104
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
for that so if Josh and I were to stand
 

105
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,649
for that so if Josh and I were to stand
chest to chest like this so this is the

106
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
chest to chest like this so this is the
 

107
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,539
chest to chest like this so this is the
same as we were second go and we know

108
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:02,549
same as we were second go and we know
 

109
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,399
same as we were second go and we know
Josh can do a forward roll with that

110
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,409
Josh can do a forward roll with that
 

111
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,990
Josh can do a forward roll with that
okay I'm gonna turn this way and I'm

112
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
okay I'm gonna turn this way and I'm
 

113
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,789
okay I'm gonna turn this way and I'm
ready get Josh's forward hand like this

114
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:07,799
ready get Josh's forward hand like this
 

115
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,350

now all Josh is gonna do is a forward

136
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,580
now all Josh is gonna do is a forward
 

137
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,640
now all Josh is gonna do is a forward
roll and I'm gonna provide the butt base

138
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,650
roll and I'm gonna provide the butt base
 

139
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,020
roll and I'm gonna provide the butt base
so when he rolls

140
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,030
so when he rolls
 

141
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,600
so when he rolls
he doesn't smash down right so all I'm

142
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,610
he doesn't smash down right so all I'm
 

143
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,220
he doesn't smash down right so all I'm
doing is holding him so he's doing the

144
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,230
doing is holding him so he's doing the
 

145
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,200
doing is holding him so he's doing the
forward roll if he has a hard time doing

146
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,210
forward roll if he has a hard time doing
 

147
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,400
forward roll if he has a hard time doing
this and say we got someone who starts

148
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,410
this and say we got someone who starts
 

149
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,570
this and say we got someone who starts
trying to pay allowing can you do a

150
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:36,580
trying to pay allowing can you do a
 

151
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,100
trying to pay allowing can you do a
bailout anymore yeah there we go good

152
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,110
bailout anymore yeah there we go good
 

153
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,140
bailout anymore yeah there we go good
okay so that's like a bad bailout right

154
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,150
okay so that's like a bad bailout right
 

155
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,370
okay so that's like a bad bailout right
and that's because josh is scared so if

156
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,380
and that's because josh is scared so if
 

157
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,390
and that's because josh is scared so if
I get someone who's doing that I'm gonna

158
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
I get someone who's doing that I'm gonna
 

159
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,470
I get someone who's doing that I'm gonna
