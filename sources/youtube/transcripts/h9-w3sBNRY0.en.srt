00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
okay
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,390
okay
back to the basics so um

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
back to the basics so um
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,310
back to the basics so um
he's gonna do that the push stroke okay

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
he's gonna do that the push stroke okay
 

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,269
he's gonna do that the push stroke okay
so he's going and i'm going to um

8
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
so he's going and i'm going to um
 

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,990
so he's going and i'm going to um
work my internal aspects now don't

my internal aspects with biomechanical

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
my internal aspects with biomechanical
 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,910
my internal aspects with biomechanical
advantage

16
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
advantage
 

17
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,669
advantage
okay biomechanical advantage is external

18
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
okay biomechanical advantage is external
 

19
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,270
okay biomechanical advantage is external
it's material internal aspects

20
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
it's material internal aspects
 

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,470
it's material internal aspects
is not material it's energetic so

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
is not material it's energetic so
 

23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,430
is not material it's energetic so
he's he's he's uh pinning me down and

24
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
he's he's he's uh pinning me down and
 

25
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,430
he's he's he's uh pinning me down and
the fact that i can lift him up

26
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
the fact that i can lift him up
 

27
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,430
the fact that i can lift him up
is not exter is not internal

28
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
is not exter is not internal
 

29
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,790
is not exter is not internal
got it it's external internal is not

30
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
got it it's external internal is not
 

31
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,470
got it it's external internal is not
what i do with my body

32
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
what i do with my body
 

33
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,670
what i do with my body
or even his body but what i do with his

34
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
or even his body but what i do with his
 

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,189
or even his body but what i do with his
energy with the energy such that

you can be mechanically unsound

38
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
you can be mechanically unsound
 

39
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,549
you can be mechanically unsound
and internally sound okay

40
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
and internally sound okay
 

41
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,390
and internally sound okay
so we're not dealing with biomechanical

42
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
so we're not dealing with biomechanical
 

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,870
so we're not dealing with biomechanical
efficiency

44
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
efficiency
 

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,990
efficiency
so as he goes i have my yielding

46
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
so as he goes i have my yielding
 

47
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,789
so as he goes i have my yielding
techniques so i'm going to yield

48
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
techniques so i'm going to yield
 

49
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,630
techniques so i'm going to yield
but that would be external

50
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
but that would be external
 

51
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,749
but that would be external
the internal aspect is the friction

52
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
the internal aspect is the friction
 

53
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,469
the internal aspect is the friction
that i create through an ikea adhesion

54
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
that i create through an ikea adhesion
 

55
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,109
that i create through an ikea adhesion
so

56
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
so
 

57
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,830
so
in other words i'm not going like this

58
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
in other words i'm not going like this
 

59
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,230
in other words i'm not going like this
i'm

60
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
i'm
 

61
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,270
i'm
stuck i'm stuck to him okay

62
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
stuck i'm stuck to him okay
 

63
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,310
stuck i'm stuck to him okay
so he tries to go backwards and hit the

64
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
so he tries to go backwards and hit the
 

65
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,270
so he tries to go backwards and hit the
backwards

66
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
backwards
 

67
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,630
backwards
he's going to feel the the uh

68
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
he's going to feel the the uh
 

69
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,149
he's going to feel the the uh
friction okay so he goes it's not just

70
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
friction okay so he goes it's not just
 

71
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,590
friction okay so he goes it's not just
moving out of the way

72
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
moving out of the way
 

73
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,950
moving out of the way
not just moving out of the way but stuck

74
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
not just moving out of the way but stuck
 

75
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,469
not just moving out of the way but stuck
push stop pull stuck

76
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
push stop pull stuck
 

77
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,510
push stop pull stuck
that's the internal aspect okay

78
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
that's the internal aspect okay
 

79
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,789
that's the internal aspect okay
so i have an external yin move and an

80
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
so i have an external yin move and an
 

81
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,190
so i have an external yin move and an
internal yin moo which is the ikea

82
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
internal yin moo which is the ikea
 

83
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,990
internal yin moo which is the ikea
adhesion

84
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
adhesion
 

85
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,429
adhesion
okay then he's gonna go again

86
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
okay then he's gonna go again
 

87
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,630
okay then he's gonna go again
and because it's a yin yang world i also

88
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
and because it's a yin yang world i also
 

89
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,510
and because it's a yin yang world i also
have

90
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
have
 

91
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,550
have
an external there's an external

92
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
an external there's an external
 

93
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,910
an external there's an external
kind of separating mechanics in other

94
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
kind of separating mechanics in other
 

95
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,030
kind of separating mechanics in other
words uh

96
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
words uh
 

97
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,750
words uh
my arms are between he and i but the

98
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
my arms are between he and i but the
 

99
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,869
my arms are between he and i but the
internal

100
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
internal
 

101
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,670
internal
is energetic and it's a call q so he

102
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
is energetic and it's a call q so he
 

103
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,630
is energetic and it's a call q so he
pushes

104
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
pushes
 

105
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,510
pushes
and i aim that up and i'm sorry down and

106
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
and i aim that up and i'm sorry down and
 

107
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,949
and i aim that up and i'm sorry down and
through his center

108
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
through his center
 

109
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,229
through his center
so yin pull

110
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
so yin pull
 

111
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,430
so yin pull
with the eye key push with this

112
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
with the eye key push with this
 

113
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,589
with the eye key push with this
and he's gonna push and i'll aim that

114
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
and he's gonna push and i'll aim that
 

115
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,190
and he's gonna push and i'll aim that
into his center

116
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200

 

117
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,790

and we're gonna go so he's trying to hit

118
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
and we're gonna go so he's trying to hit
 

119
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,190

341
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,430
right you could go bologna lettuce bread
bologna lettuce bread and you'll figure

342
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
bologna lettuce bread and you'll figure
 

343
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,190
bologna lettuce bread and you'll figure
it out or you won't figure it out

344
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
it out or you won't figure it out
 

345
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,350
it out or you won't figure it out

362
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
traps too there he goes you see
 

363
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,470
traps too there he goes you see
i've got push on it he's going to go

364
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
i've got push on it he's going to go
 

365
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,990
i've got push on it he's going to go
around it boom

366
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
around it boom
 

367
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,350
around it boom
this kind of thing so he's he's trying

368
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
this kind of thing so he's he's trying
 

369
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,990
this kind of thing so he's he's trying
to do

370
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
to do
 

371
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,670
to do
these things okay

372
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680

 

373
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,470

but you look at it and you want to say

374
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
but you look at it and you want to say
 

375
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,949
but you look at it and you want to say
why

376
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
why
 

377
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,230
why
isn't he doing those things he is trying

378
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
isn't he doing those things he is trying
 

379
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,509
isn't he doing those things he is trying
to do those things

380
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
to do those things
 

381
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,910
to do those things
okay so if he goes like this let's say

382
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
okay so if he goes like this let's say
 

383
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,110
okay so if he goes like this let's say
he's going to go around he's going to do

384
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
he's going to go around he's going to do
 

385
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,550
he's going to go around he's going to do
a trap this way

386
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
a trap this way
 

387
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,949
a trap this way
okay so that's what he's trying to do

388
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
okay so that's what he's trying to do
 

389
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,590
okay so that's what he's trying to do
and you'll see he breaks contact

390
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
and you'll see he breaks contact
 

391
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
and you'll see he breaks contact
he's breaking contact not because of

392
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
he's breaking contact not because of
 

393
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,190
he's breaking contact not because of
what he's doing

394
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
what he's doing
 

395
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,750
what he's doing
because it's a codependent world you see

396
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
because it's a codependent world you see
 

397
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,110
because it's a codependent world you see
that's the world view the fourth

398
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
that's the world view the fourth
 

399
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,230
that's the world view the fourth
discipline

400
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
discipline
 

401
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,710
discipline
he broke he breaks contact because i

402
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
he broke he breaks contact because i
 

403
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,630
he broke he breaks contact because i
pushed over here

404
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
pushed over here
 

405
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,190
pushed over here
see if he doesn't say one

406
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200

 

407
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,670

then you want to go why why didn't he

408
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
then you want to go why why didn't he
 

409
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,269
then you want to go why why didn't he
try he did try

410
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
try he did try
 

411
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,990
try he did try
but i did not break contact with him and

412
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
but i did not break contact with him and
 

413
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,389
but i did not break contact with him and
then he did not break contact with me

414
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
then he did not break contact with me
 

415
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,430
then he did not break contact with me
do you see that so he he's gonna go

416
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
do you see that so he he's gonna go
 

417
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,470
do you see that so he he's gonna go
around

418
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
around
 

419
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,590
around
and i'm back where we started you see

420
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
and i'm back where we started you see
 

421
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,590
and i'm back where we started you see
and he's gonna try to go around and i'm

422
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
and he's gonna try to go around and i'm
 

423

sword around
you see that's how we don't break

434
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
you see that's how we don't break
 

435
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,230
you see that's how we don't break
contact

something he is trained he knows how to

440
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
something he is trained he knows how to
 

441
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,069
something he is trained he knows how to
go around

442
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
go around
 

443
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,310
go around
or use the other hand or what have you

444
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
or use the other hand or what have you
 

445

453
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,949

now i want to stay with him in a way

454
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
now i want to stay with him in a way
 

455
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,310
now i want to stay with him in a way
that i get the kazushi pattern

456
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
that i get the kazushi pattern
 

457
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,710
that i get the kazushi pattern
do you see that there's the front inward

458
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
do you see that there's the front inward
 

459
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,150
do you see that there's the front inward
kazushi pattern

460
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160

 

461
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,230

i don't want to just stay with him

462
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240

 

463
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,230

he's trying to hit that thing and i'm

464
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
he's trying to hit that thing and i'm
 

465
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,629
he's trying to hit that thing and i'm
this i don't want to do that

466
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
this i don't want to do that
 

467
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,949
this i don't want to do that
i i have an agenda to do i stay with him

468
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
i i have an agenda to do i stay with him
 

469
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,750
i i have an agenda to do i stay with him
but i take him into the front inward

470
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
but i take him into the front inward
 

471
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,269
but i take him into the front inward
kazushi pattern

472
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
kazushi pattern
 

473
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,230
kazushi pattern
okay or the outward kazushi pattern

474
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
okay or the outward kazushi pattern
 

475
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,910
okay or the outward kazushi pattern
i don't just stay with him okay

476
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
i don't just stay with him okay
 

477
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,269
i don't just stay with him okay
so i stay with him and i'm aiming for

478
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
so i stay with him and i'm aiming for
 

479
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,190
so i stay with him and i'm aiming for
those kazushi powders you see it right

480
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
those kazushi powders you see it right
 

481
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,509
those kazushi powders you see it right
here

482
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519

 

483
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,949

now the question is how do you generate

484
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
now the question is how do you generate
 

485
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,069
now the question is how do you generate
the kazushi pattern okay so he's going

486
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
the kazushi pattern okay so he's going
 

487
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,710
the kazushi pattern okay so he's going
again

488
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
again
 

489
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,190
again
it's going to be the same one you see do

490
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
it's going to be the same one you see do
 

491
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,949
it's going to be the same one you see do
i generate it

492
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
i generate it
 

493
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,829
i generate it
by an external pull and an external push

494
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
by an external pull and an external push
 

495
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,710
by an external pull and an external push
could you

496
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
could you
 

497
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,069
could you
yes it's the same geometry but

498
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
yes it's the same geometry but
 

499
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,790
yes it's the same geometry but
it's not the internal aspects of the art

500
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
it's not the internal aspects of the art
 

501
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,230
it's not the internal aspects of the art
okay

502
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
okay
 

503
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,590
okay
the way i'm going to do it is with

504
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
the way i'm going to do it is with
 

505
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,030
the way i'm going to do it is with
an ik adhesion on this arm

we won't define it yet but i'm going to

508
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
we won't define it yet but i'm going to
 

509
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,750
we won't define it yet but i'm going to
demonstrate it

510
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
demonstrate it
 

511
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,670
demonstrate it
do you see it's and then

512
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
do you see it's and then
 

513
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,350
do you see it's and then

okay
so what are they

522
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
so what are they
 

523
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,790
so what are they
well his energy with his intention

00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
trying to hitch me
 

527
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,389
trying to hitch me
is of being allowed to pass into me

00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
is of being allowed to pass into me
 

529
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,509
is of being allowed to pass into me
it's going to pass into me you see

heaven comes through man hits the earth
and i'm going to release it

534
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
and i'm going to release it
 

535
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,949
and i'm going to release it
if i release it in a positive young

536
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
if i release it in a positive young
 

537
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,990
if i release it in a positive young
he will be displaced so we'll go we'll

538
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
he will be displaced so we'll go we'll
 

539
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,110
he will be displaced so we'll go we'll
do that one again

540
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
do that one again
 

541
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,189
do that one again
a little quicker you see

542
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199

his energies going into me into me
 

547
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,750
his energies going into me into me
but i only release it so that it's

548
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
but i only release it so that it's
 

549
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,269
but i only release it so that it's
neutral if i push on it it would be a

550
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
neutral if i push on it it would be a
 

551
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,949
neutral if i push on it it would be a
cocky projection

552
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
cocky projection
 

553
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,389

right if i go negative i'm going to come

554
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
right if i go negative i'm going to come
 

555
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,430
right if i go negative i'm going to come

off of him
okay so the energy is coming

558
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
okay so the energy is coming
 

559
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,550
okay so the energy is coming
with this hand on the technique we

560
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
with this hand on the technique we
 

561
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,870
with this hand on the technique we
showed had the ik adhesion

562
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
showed had the ik adhesion
 

563
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,470
showed had the ik adhesion
i keep the energetic output

564
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
i keep the energetic output
 

565
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,230
i keep the energetic output
equal to his that's what creates this

566
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
equal to his that's what creates this
 

567
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,870
equal to his that's what creates this
friction

568
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
friction
 

569
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,230
friction
or i like to say the universe does what

570
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
or i like to say the universe does what
 

571
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,949
or i like to say the universe does what
the universe does i let it do

572
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
the universe does i let it do
 

573
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,949
the universe does i let it do
okay that means i have an equivalent

574
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
okay that means i have an equivalent
 

575
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,750
okay that means i have an equivalent
energetic output universe doesn't know

576
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
energetic output universe doesn't know
 

577
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,590
energetic output universe doesn't know
that those are two separate things and

578
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
that those are two separate things and
 

579
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,230
that those are two separate things and
treats it as one thing

580
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
treats it as one thing
 

581
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,350
treats it as one thing
that's what happens okay so

582
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
that's what happens okay so
 

583
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,030
that's what happens okay so
don't contest but you'll see push

584
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
don't contest but you'll see push
 

585
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,629
don't contest but you'll see push
he's he's in these traps already use

586
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
he's he's in these traps already use
 

587
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,750
he's he's in these traps already use
meaning the energetic traps okay use

588
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
meaning the energetic traps okay use
 

589
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,470
meaning the energetic traps okay use
them

590
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
them
 

591
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,069
them
to find the kazushi here's gonna be your

592
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
to find the kazushi here's gonna be your
 

593
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,870
to find the kazushi here's gonna be your
call cube

594
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
call cube
 

595
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,629
call cube
here's gonna be your ip

596
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639

 

597
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,030

so he's trying to do his thing i stay

598
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
so he's trying to do his thing i stay
 

599
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,030
so he's trying to do his thing i stay
with him there it is

600
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040

 

601
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,030

it gets kind of silly but it's

602
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,040
it gets kind of silly but it's
 

603
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,189
it gets kind of silly but it's
ritualistic

604
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
ritualistic
 

605
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,790
ritualistic
because you're you're going to find the

606
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
because you're you're going to find the
 

607
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,389
because you're you're going to find the
kazushi pattern

608
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
kazushi pattern
 

609
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:38,790
kazushi pattern
easy easy it's easy

610
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800

 

611
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,230

so work on other things

612
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240

 

613
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:56,790

do the adhesion a little extra

614
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800

 

615
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,670

okay so

616
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680

 

617
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,110

i'm not contested in two ways

618
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
i'm not contested in two ways
 

619
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,030
i'm not contested in two ways
an external way i yield and i stay with

620
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
an external way i yield and i stay with
 

621
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,990
an external way i yield and i stay with
him

622
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
him
 

623
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,590
him
and the internal way the immaterial

624
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
and the internal way the immaterial
 

625
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,110
and the internal way the immaterial
passes through the material got it

626
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
passes through the material got it
 

627
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,230
passes through the material got it
that is the ultimate non-contention it

628
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
that is the ultimate non-contention it
 

629
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,990
that is the ultimate non-contention it
passes through me

630
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
passes through me
 

631
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,110
passes through me
both through and both out

632
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120

 

633
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,910

so you can have like these skeletal

634
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
so you can have like these skeletal
 

635
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,470
so you can have like these skeletal
alignments you see

636
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
alignments you see
 

637
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,269
alignments you see
and do these skeletal alignments

638
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279

 

639
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,030

that's not that's external okay

640
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
that's not that's external okay
 

641
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,990
that's not that's external okay
so i don't want to find you're trying to

642
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
so i don't want to find you're trying to
 

643
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,870
so i don't want to find you're trying to
get the chest

644
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
get the chest
 

645
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,470
get the chest
i don't want to find you see there it is

646
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
i don't want to find you see there it is
 

647
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,269
i don't want to find you see there it is
right there did you see it and you going

648
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279

 

649
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,990

so go out all we're going to do skeletal

650
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
so go out all we're going to do skeletal
 

651
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,590
so go out all we're going to do skeletal
alignment

652
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
alignment
 

653
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,670
alignment
you see that's not it okay

654
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
you see that's not it okay
 

655
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,669
you see that's not it okay
i am

656
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679

 

657
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:20,949

just doing energetic projections

658
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959

 

659
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,909

so what what is that what does that mean

660
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
so what what is that what does that mean
 

661
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,829
so what what is that what does that mean
how does it look like okay

662
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
how does it look like okay
 

663
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,870
how does it look like okay
so usually what you're going to see is

664
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
so usually what you're going to see is
 

665
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,270
so usually what you're going to see is
i uh don't bend your joints

666
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
i uh don't bend your joints
 

667
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,230
i uh don't bend your joints
you see and then i bend your joints and

668
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
you see and then i bend your joints and
 

669
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,430
you see and then i bend your joints and
then

670
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
then
 

671
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,190
then
i push your joint

672
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200

 

673
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,669

so here i'm going to push around this

674
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
so here i'm going to push around this
 

675
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,070
so here i'm going to push around this
axis point like this

676
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
