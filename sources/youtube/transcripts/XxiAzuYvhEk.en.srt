fundamental footwork drills to build
 

55
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,779
fundamental footwork drills to build
spontaneous footwork so remember we just

56
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:12,789
spontaneous footwork so remember we just
 

57
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,399
spontaneous footwork so remember we just
have our basic four movements we're

58
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:14,409
have our basic four movements we're
 

59
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,310
have our basic four movements we're
gonna do a sukiyaki and au Miyaichi 10

60
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,320
gonna do a sukiyaki and au Miyaichi 10

con or a chi chi's those are our basic
 

63
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:24,450
con or a chi chi's those are our basic
movements you get a set of tools so at

64
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,460
movements you get a set of tools so at
 

65
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,630
movements you get a set of tools so at
the dojo I use these sticks to give them

66
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
the dojo I use these sticks to give them
 

67
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,459
the dojo I use these sticks to give them
an auditory response so they can hear

68
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:29,469
an auditory response so they can hear
 

69
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,230
an auditory response so they can hear
that to have an immediate response and I

70
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
that to have an immediate response and I
 

71
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,020
that to have an immediate response and I
use to click for out of you Miyaichi and

72
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,030
use to click for out of you Miyaichi and
 

73
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,090
use to click for out of you Miyaichi and
one click for sukiyaki and then I

74
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,100
one click for sukiyaki and then I
 

75
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,609
one click for sukiyaki and then I
verbally tell them either tin con or Tai

76
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:38,619
verbally tell them either tin con or Tai
 

77
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,559
verbally tell them either tin con or Tai
Chi ah sh t when we do that I sometimes

78
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:40,569
Chi ah sh t when we do that I sometimes
 

79
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,520
Chi ah sh t when we do that I sometimes
will also add eating meat n con right so

80
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:43,530
will also add eating meat n con right so
 

81
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,330
will also add eating meat n con right so
meaning that they're gonna do a two-step

82
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,340
meaning that they're gonna do a two-step
 

83
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,899
meaning that they're gonna do a two-step
or a you Miyaichi 10 con right so this

84
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:48,909
or a you Miyaichi 10 con right so this
 

85
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:56,779
or a you Miyaichi 10 con right so this
is basically how the drill goes 10 con

86
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:56,789
is basically how the drill goes 10 con
 

87
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,520
is basically how the drill goes 10 con
Tai Chi

88
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,530
Tai Chi
 

89
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:09,599
Tai Chi
10 con - okay so that's the basic idea

90
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:09,609
10 con - okay so that's the basic idea
 

91
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,280
10 con - okay so that's the basic idea
of the drill now what's important in

92
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,290
of the drill now what's important in
 

93
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,840
of the drill now what's important in
this drill is the students should be

94
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:12,850
this drill is the students should be
 

95
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,720
this drill is the students should be
learning to not go without a command so

96
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,730
learning to not go without a command so
 

97
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,580
learning to not go without a command so
if there's no command they shouldn't go

98
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:17,590
if there's no command they shouldn't go
 

99
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,160
if there's no command they shouldn't go
they should also try not to guess what's

100
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,170
they should also try not to guess what's
 

101
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,349
they should also try not to guess what's
going to happen so their mind should be

102
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:22,359
going to happen so their mind should be
 

103
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,509
going to happen so their mind should be
currently in the moment always so if I

104
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:24,519
currently in the moment always so if I
 

105
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,160
currently in the moment always so if I
haven't given them instruction then

106
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,170
haven't given them instruction then
 

107
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,330
haven't given them instruction then
they're not gonna do anything and

108
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:27,340
they're not gonna do anything and
 

109
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,039
they're not gonna do anything and
they're always gonna do the instruction

110
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,049
they're always gonna do the instruction
 

111
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,660
they're always gonna do the instruction
I give now I can make this much more

112
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,670
I give now I can make this much more
 

113
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,729
I give now I can make this much more
challenging as I've changed the speed or

114
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:32,739
challenging as I've changed the speed or
 

115
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,129
challenging as I've changed the speed or
tempo sometimes I can give them a set of

116
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:35,139
tempo sometimes I can give them a set of
 

117
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,900
tempo sometimes I can give them a set of
the same thing over and over and over

118
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:36,910
the same thing over and over and over
 

119
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,580
the same thing over and over and over
and then change that set so I can do

120
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,590
and then change that set so I can do
 

121
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,140
and then change that set so I can do
lots of things to mess with them which

122
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,150
lots of things to mess with them which
 

123
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,699
lots of things to mess with them which
is what I want to do so I want to give

124
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:41,709
is what I want to do so I want to give
 

125
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,379
is what I want to do so I want to give
them a really hard time so it forces

126
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:43,389
them a really hard time so it forces
 

127
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,539
them a really hard time so it forces
them to stay in the moment now above all

128
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:45,549
them to stay in the moment now above all
 

129
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:46,680
them to stay in the moment now above all
that they want to make sure they're

130
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,690
that they want to make sure they're
 

131
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,870
that they want to make sure they're
always resetting their rocoto combined

132
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:48,880
always resetting their rocoto combined
 

133
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,910
always resetting their rocoto combined
with their weight forward so it's going

134
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
with their weight forward so it's going
 

135
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,530
with their weight forward so it's going
to be weight forward when they're doing

136
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:52,540
to be weight forward when they're doing
 

137
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,940
to be weight forward when they're doing
this and that means that they can move

138
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:53,950
this and that means that they can move
 

139
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,800
this and that means that they can move
freely into any of those four steps any

140
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:55,810
freely into any of those four steps any
 

141
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,449
freely into any of those four steps any
time it happens now I'm gonna try and

142
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:57,459
time it happens now I'm gonna try and
 

143
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,530
time it happens now I'm gonna try and
give them a little bit of a hard time to

144
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:58,540
give them a little bit of a hard time to
 

145
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,030
give them a little bit of a hard time to
show you guys and let's see what we can

146
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,040
show you guys and let's see what we can
 

147
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,860
show you guys and let's see what we can
do with them here now if I give a long

148
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:04,870
do with them here now if I give a long
 

149
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,629
do with them here now if I give a long
pause they should be making sure they

150
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:06,639
pause they should be making sure they
 

151
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,690
pause they should be making sure they
don't change their

152
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,700
don't change their
 

153
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,070
don't change their
stance their stance should always be

154
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,080
stance their stance should always be
 

155
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,020
