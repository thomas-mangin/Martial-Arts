then

306
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,040
then
 

307
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,590
then
boom

308
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
boom
 

309
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,590
boom
and in

310
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:38,600

out in
 

313
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,550
out in
out this is the shape of it don't I'm

314
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
out this is the shape of it don't I'm
 

315
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,069
out this is the shape of it don't I'm
not just showing that there's a inward

316
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,079
not just showing that there's a inward
 

317
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,750
not just showing that there's a inward
because inward always proceedes outward

318
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
because inward always proceedes outward
 

319
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,350
because inward always proceedes outward
outward always proceeds Inward and then

320
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
outward always proceeds Inward and then
 

321
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,069
outward always proceeds Inward and then
the

movements are too long for what we're

344
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
movements are too long for what we're
 

345
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,629
movements are too long for what we're
going to do but that is the shape okay

346
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:47,639
going to do but that is the shape okay
 

347
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,870
going to do but that is the shape okay
all right let's try that we're going to

348
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
all right let's try that we're going to
 

349
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,910
all right let's try that we're going to
keep with the movement but you can start

350
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:50,920
keep with the movement but you can start
 

351

shaking them if you get too big it's
 

353
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,030
shaking them if you get too big it's
going to be a bigger stepping stone to

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,749
going to be a bigger stepping stone to
the technique okay so again you come

356
00:13:58,749 --> 00:13:58,759
the technique okay so again you come
 

357
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,030
the technique okay so again you come
comes around and

358
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,040
comes around and
 

359
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,829
comes around and
elbow

360
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
elbow
 

361
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,590
elbow
elbow okay comes

362
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
elbow okay comes
 

363
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,629
elbow okay comes
around

364
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:09,639
around
 

365
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,269
around
boom all right and to that we add the CH

366
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
boom all right and to that we add the CH
 

367
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,470
boom all right and to that we add the CH
drop so
