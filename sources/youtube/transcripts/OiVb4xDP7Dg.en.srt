out okay and while it's drawing the
 

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,110
out okay and while it's drawing the
circles on that plane it's got to

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,120
circles on that plane it's got to
 

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,830
circles on that plane it's got to
rotate right okay so to help me get that

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,840
rotate right okay so to help me get that
 

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,910
rotate right okay so to help me get that
rotation at the beginning it's it's

20
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
rotation at the beginning it's it's

tactically I am trying
 

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,430
tactically I am trying
to put him on that

180
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
to put him on that
 

181
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,430
to put him on that
angle that is the most efficient angle

182
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,440
angle that is the most efficient angle
 

183
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,749
angle that is the most efficient angle
for displacing him Topsy turby wise okay

184
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:28,759
for displacing him Topsy turby wise okay
 

185
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,070
for displacing him Topsy turby wise okay
I I need to get get that 45 the rolling

I I need to get get that 45 the rolling
 

187
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,189
I I need to get get that 45 the rolling
angle okay that that's what's happening

188
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199
angle okay that that's what's happening
 

189
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,390
angle okay that that's what's happening
here so if he stays there right his

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,270
that's what I'm that's why I'm doing the
inward spiral okay he's there his head

198
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,280
inward spiral okay he's there his head
 

199
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,790
inward spiral okay he's there his head
was going that way I'm going to do it

200
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:49,800
was going that way I'm going to do it
 

201
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,869
was going that way I'm going to do it
mechanically now and you get someone

202
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
mechanically now and you get someone
 

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,230
mechanically now and you get someone
going topy tur

204
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
going topy tur
 

205
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,670
going topy tur
okay there is a

206
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
okay there is a
 

207
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,270
okay there is a
small angle can olation on this arm here

208
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,280
small angle can olation on this arm here
 

209
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,149
small angle can olation on this arm here
too you see it's moving down and away

210
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:07,159
too you see it's moving down and away
 

211
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,790

spiroid the outward turn
 

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,670
spiroid the outward turn
spiroid and it's the same

222
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
spiroid and it's the same
 

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,029
spiroid and it's the same
thing my pelvis has to be involved

224
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
thing my pelvis has to be involved
 

225
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,909

difference and it has to aim through his
 

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,389
difference and it has to aim through his
Center so the same

238

Matrix when he was on all the

282
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
Matrix when he was on all the
 

283
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,630
Matrix when he was on all the
ground okay that's the same feeling so

284
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
ground okay that's the same feeling so

you don't want to whether you're doing
the inward spiral right you don't want

288
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
the inward spiral right you don't want
 

289
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,069
the inward spiral right you don't want
to do that you got to go down into the

290
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:17,079
to do that you got to go down into the
 

291
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,949
to do that you got to go down into the
ground okay down into the ground boom

this as he comes to grab me I create the
 

303
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,949
this as he comes to grab me I create the
Suki the hole that's where I move into

304
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:37,959
Suki the hole that's where I move into
 

305
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,590
Suki the hole that's where I move into
okay stke then I do the inward

306
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:44,600

 

307
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,310

spiral comes to grab Suki boom out we'll

308
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:49,320
spiral comes to grab Suki boom out we'll
 

309
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,069
spiral comes to grab Suki boom out we'll
just leave the in spiral there we'll

310
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
just leave the in spiral there we'll
 

311
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,550
just leave the in spiral there we'll
leave the lock

312
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
leave the lock
 

313
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:08,269
leave the lock
out hey how keep your gra boom h

314

315
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,230

so my body is flanking one two I'm

316
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,240
so my body is flanking one two I'm
 

317
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,990
so my body is flanking one two I'm
looking at him from that zon Sanctuary

318
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,000
looking at him from that zon Sanctuary
 

319
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,629
looking at him from that zon Sanctuary
right on the other side of the Cross

320
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:18,639
right on the other side of the Cross
 

321
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,430
right on the other side of the Cross
lateral shoulder you see that so make

322
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
lateral shoulder you see that so make
 

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,790
lateral shoulder you see that so make
sure you're not

324

sure you're not
 

325
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,629
sure you're not
here cuz you're not out of range you got

326
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:25,639
here cuz you're not out of range you got
 

327
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,350
here cuz you're not out of range you got
to move to the zone of sanctuary

328
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
to move to the zone of sanctuary
 

329
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,629
to move to the zone of sanctuary
the

330
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:31,639

 

331
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:39,269

45 close it move away from

332
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279

 

333
00:11:39,279 --> 00:12:01,470

it close it move away from it

334
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,480

 

335
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,629

okayy let's

336
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
okayy let's
 

337
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,910
okayy let's
try okay so it's the same inward spiral

338
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
try okay so it's the same inward spiral
 

339
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,190
try okay so it's the same inward spiral
right same inward spir but you're

340
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,200
right same inward spir but you're
 

341
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,310
right same inward spir but you're

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,990
more flat on them okay so that hand goes
there this hand is doing everything the

510
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
there this hand is doing everything the
 

511
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,270
there this hand is doing everything the
same this hand is going to

512
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,280

 

513
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,429

pull and you'll have a small Nik

514
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
pull and you'll have a small Nik
 

515
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,510
pull and you'll have a small Nik
effect onto what you were already doing

516
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:24,520
effect onto what you were already doing
 

517
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,630
effect onto what you were already doing
which was moving him already but now you

518
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:27,640
which was moving him already but now you
 

519
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,390
which was moving him already but now you
create a better angle cancellation on

520
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:31,400
create a better angle cancellation on
 

521
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,470
create a better angle cancellation on
that shoulder remember I said when you

522
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,480
that shoulder remember I said when you
 

523
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,390
that shoulder remember I said when you
when you create that rolling geometry

524
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:37,400
when you create that rolling geometry
 

525
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,110
when you create that rolling geometry
right you have a small angle

526
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
right you have a small angle
 

527
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,990
right you have a small angle
cancellation on that shoulder remember I

528
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,000
cancellation on that shoulder remember I
 

529
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,990
cancellation on that shoulder remember I
said that okay so we want to increase

530
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000

 

531
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,909

it so I'm pulling this don't worry okay

532
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:52,919
it so I'm pulling this don't worry okay
 

533
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,430
it so I'm pulling this don't worry okay
here see what I'm doing to this shoulder

534
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,440
here see what I'm doing to this shoulder
 

535
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,470
here see what I'm doing to this shoulder
see it's coming ahead of the other

536
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
see it's coming ahead of the other
 

537
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,549
see it's coming ahead of the other
shoulder

538
00:17:59,549 --> 00:17:59,559
shoulder
 

539
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,430
shoulder
okay and when it does

540
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440

 

541
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,270

that you start to cancel that other side

542
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,280
that you start to cancel that other side
 

543
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,230
that you start to cancel that other side
out more guys with me okay so

544
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240

 

545
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,669

here this hand is home cutting through

546
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
here this hand is home cutting through
 

547
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,110
here this hand is home cutting through
the center this do that side and this

548
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
the center this do that side and this
 

549
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,549
the center this do that side and this
hand is pulling that shoulder

550
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
hand is pulling that shoulder
 

551
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,029
hand is pulling that shoulder
ahead okay that's what you're trying to

552
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
ahead okay that's what you're trying to
 

553
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,750
ahead okay that's what you're trying to
do so you this hand cannot do what this

554
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
do so you this hand cannot do what this
 

555
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,390
do so you this hand cannot do what this
hand is doing

556
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
hand is doing
 

557
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:39,190
hand is doing
this hand has to come

558
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200

 

559
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,430

back this makes him light right and this

560
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
back this makes him light right and this
 

561
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,830
back this makes him light right and this
turns his

562
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
turns his
 

563
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,070
turns his
shoulder light

564
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
shoulder light
 

565
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,350
shoulder light
turn light

566
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360

 

567
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,750

turn okay and now we put that into the

568
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:56,760
turn okay and now we put that into the
 

569
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,990
turn okay and now we put that into the
other part where we had the movement so

570
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
other part where we had the movement so
 

571
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,190
other part where we had the movement so
I close them

572
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
I close them
 

573
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:12,230
I close them
move close them

574
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240

 

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,510

move and it's the same thing I don't

576
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:14,520
move and it's the same thing I don't
 

577
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,549
move and it's the same thing I don't
want to go back to

578
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:17,559
want to go back to
 

579
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,190
want to go back to
here

580
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,200
here
 

581
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,070
here
here I just threw all that weight at me

582
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,080
here I just threw all that weight at me
 

583
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,029
here I just threw all that weight at me
right his his momentum was coming this

584
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:26,039
right his his momentum was coming this
 

585
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,470
right his his momentum was coming this
way

586
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,480
way
 

587
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,909
way
and I want that to be redirected on a

588
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
and I want that to be redirected on a
 

589
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,710
and I want that to be redirected on a
circle so right if I if I don't do

590
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:35,720
circle so right if I if I don't do
 

591
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,909
circle so right if I if I don't do
anything there's a residual there you

592
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
anything there's a residual there you
 

593
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:51,710
anything there's a residual there you
see that CU he comes in so that's what I

594
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:51,720

 

595
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:01,190

want so the technique should get easier

596
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200

 

597
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,909

okay you understand the Flow Part okay

598
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
okay you understand the Flow Part okay
 

599
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,390
okay you understand the Flow Part okay
you don't want to do you don't want to

600
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:07,400
you don't want to do you don't want to
 

601
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,870
you don't want to do you don't want to
have your e

602
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:09,880
have your e
 

603
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,070
have your e
behind that's that's crazy right I go

604
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
behind that's that's crazy right I go
 

605
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,590
behind that's that's crazy right I go
one way I pull into me and then and I go

606
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
one way I pull into me and then and I go
 

607
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,270
one way I pull into me and then and I go
like that right or I pull my

608
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,280

 

609
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,789

hand okay again like I always say if

610
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:25,799
hand okay again like I always say if
 

611
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,549
hand okay again like I always say if
you're that strong to throw a guy into

612
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:27,559
you're that strong to throw a guy into
 

613
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,549
you're that strong to throw a guy into
you and then push him you should have

614
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:29,559
you and then push him you should have
 

615
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,070
you and then push him you should have
just grabbed the front part of his face

616
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,080
just grabbed the front part of his face
 

617
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,110
just grabbed the front part of his face
and ripped it off right that's you're

618
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
and ripped it off right that's you're
 

619
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,710
and ripped it off right that's you're
that strong okay you're you're supposed

620
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:35,720
that strong okay you're you're supposed
 

621
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,669
that strong okay you're you're supposed
to

622
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:36,679
to
 

623
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,350
to
blend so which way was he coming in

624
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,360
blend so which way was he coming in
 

625
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,909
blend so which way was he coming in
which way he's going that way which way

626
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:42,919
which way he's going that way which way
 

627
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,110
which way he's going that way which way
should he be going that

628
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120

 

629
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,830

way he's coming

630
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840

 

631
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,870

in

632
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880

 

633
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,310

okay so you have to to figure out how to

634
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,320
okay so you have to to figure out how to
 

635
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,070
okay so you have to to figure out how to
put all of these angles

636
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
put all of these angles
 

637
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,070
put all of these angles
together so that you're

638
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080

 

639
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,000

not okay try it again
