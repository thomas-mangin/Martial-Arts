00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,950

[Music]

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960

 

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,350

so

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360

 

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:01:00,630

[Music]

6
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640

 

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,349

okay the uh

8
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
okay the uh
 

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,870
okay the uh
first thing to understand is the

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
first thing to understand is the
 

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,750
first thing to understand is the
starting my first strike

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
starting my first strike
 

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,270
starting my first strike
okay

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
okay
 

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,190
okay
um it is much closer

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200

 

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,990

than you want to think okay

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
than you want to think okay
 

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,070
than you want to think okay
so if i

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
so if i
 

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,190
so if i
imagine like last night's drill

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
imagine like last night's drill
 

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,390
imagine like last night's drill
right

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
right
 

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,749
right
it was working on the counter right

26
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
it was working on the counter right
 

27
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,950
it was working on the counter right
okay

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
okay
 

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,789
okay
um

30
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
um
 

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,510
um
so

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
so
 

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,149
so
if i had the mentality it was a strike

34
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
if i had the mentality it was a strike
 

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,510
if i had the mentality it was a strike
that's a strike counter right as a

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
that's a strike counter right as a
 

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,990
that's a strike counter right as a
strike and it was off the lead jab

38
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
strike and it was off the lead jab
 

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,510
strike and it was off the lead jab
counter the lead jab with a counter

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
counter the lead jab with a counter
 

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,190
counter the lead jab with a counter
right okay

42
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
right okay
 

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,830
right okay
if i had the aikido mentality the one

44
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
if i had the aikido mentality the one
 

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,630
if i had the aikido mentality the one
that you have now for striking

46
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
that you have now for striking
 

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,590
that you have now for striking
and i'm being you get so he has his

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
and i'm being you get so he has his
 

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,830
and i'm being you get so he has his
garga i would have been doing that stuff

50
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
garga i would have been doing that stuff
 

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,069
garga i would have been doing that stuff
for mike

52
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079

 

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,230

but no one did that because that's

54
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
but no one did that because that's
 

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,270
but no one did that because that's
clearly intuitively wrong okay

56
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
clearly intuitively wrong okay
 

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,389
clearly intuitively wrong okay
um

58
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
um
 

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,109
um
there's no need for a counter

60
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
there's no need for a counter
 

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,190
there's no need for a counter
if he's gonna start his strike from up

62
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
if he's gonna start his strike from up
 

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,749
if he's gonna start his strike from up
there so he's gonna do he's gonna start

64
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
there so he's gonna do he's gonna start
 

65
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,750
there so he's gonna do he's gonna start
his leech out from out there

66
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
his leech out from out there
 

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,630
his leech out from out there
you see okay so he's gonna hit me with

68
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
you see okay so he's gonna hit me with
 

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,550
you see okay so he's gonna hit me with
it

70
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
it
 

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,390
it
if he's gonna start his strike from out

72
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
if he's gonna start his strike from out
 

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,190
if he's gonna start his strike from out
there

74
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
there
 

75
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,229
there
don't engage the strike deviate deviate

76
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
don't engage the strike deviate deviate
 

77
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,390
don't engage the strike deviate deviate
okay it's very so he's going to start

78
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
okay it's very so he's going to start
 

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,550
okay it's very so he's going to start
his shominuchi from out there

80
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560

 

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,190

you don't have to do anything

82
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200

 

83
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,589

if you look at katata jody

84
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599

 

85
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,190

and consider this wrist

86
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200

 

87
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,070

the target

88
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080

 

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,309

manucci's target

90
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
manucci's target
 

91
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,990
manucci's target
is further in do you see that

92
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
is further in do you see that
 

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,030
is further in do you see that
so if he attacks this target

94
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
so if he attacks this target
 

95
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,550
so if he attacks this target
from there

96
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
from there
 

97
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,589
from there
let's look at where he started

98
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
let's look at where he started
 

99
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,630
let's look at where he started
do you see

100
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
do you see
 

101
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,630
do you see
what do you want to say i don't know two

102
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
what do you want to say i don't know two
 

103
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,790
what do you want to say i don't know two
feet three feet

104
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
feet three feet
 

105
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,790
feet three feet
and now he's supposed to target this

106
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
and now he's supposed to target this
 

107
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,190
and now he's supposed to target this
target

108
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
target
 

109
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,550
target
cap got it

110
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
cap got it
 

111
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,270
cap got it
so

112
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
so
 

113
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,509
so
the distance from this target to this

114
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
the distance from this target to this
 

115
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,910
the distance from this target to this
target is probably another foot

116
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
target is probably another foot
 

117
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,110
target is probably another foot
at least

118
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
at least
 

119
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,470
at least
maybe more

120
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
maybe more
 

121
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,149
maybe more
so he should start if that's where he

122
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
so he should start if that's where he
 

123
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,390
so he should start if that's where he
starts to talk to he should be in that

124
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
starts to talk to he should be in that
 

125
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,350
starts to talk to he should be in that
one to maybe more feet in to hit this

126
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
one to maybe more feet in to hit this
 

127
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,070
one to maybe more feet in to hit this
target do you understand okay now

128
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
target do you understand okay now
 

129
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,830
target do you understand okay now
there's no time to get out of the way

130
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
there's no time to get out of the way
 

131
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,149
there's no time to get out of the way
there's no time to deviate like i was i

132
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
there's no time to deviate like i was i
 

133
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,710
there's no time to deviate like i was i
have to address that strength okay

134
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
have to address that strength okay
 

135
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,509
have to address that strength okay
so that strike starts here this is where

136
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
so that strike starts here this is where
 

137
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,949
so that strike starts here this is where
striking happens

138
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
striking happens
 

139
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,990
striking happens
uh he's not uh south paw but pretend you

140
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
uh he's not uh south paw but pretend you
 

141
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,670
uh he's not uh south paw but pretend you
already take cisgarda

142
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
already take cisgarda
 

143
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,789
already take cisgarda
we're back in striking range okay

144
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
we're back in striking range okay
 

145
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,030
we're back in striking range okay
so first understand the logic of where

146
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
so first understand the logic of where
 

147
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,830
so first understand the logic of where
the strike starts it does not start back

148
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
the strike starts it does not start back
 

149
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,750
the strike starts it does not start back
out here okay

150
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
out here okay
 

151
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,670
out here okay
dude this starts back out here i would

152
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
dude this starts back out here i would
 

153
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,830
dude this starts back out here i would
deviate or i'd have time to draw my

154
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
deviate or i'd have time to draw my
 

155
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,229
deviate or i'd have time to draw my
weapon in dpa okay so that's not where

156
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
weapon in dpa okay so that's not where
 

157
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,910
weapon in dpa okay so that's not where
this is started we're in tight okay

158
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
this is started we're in tight okay
 

159
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,270
this is started we're in tight okay
and then in keyhole he's going to strike

160
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
and then in keyhole he's going to strike
 

161
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,149
and then in keyhole he's going to strike
we say strike the back leg

162
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
we say strike the back leg
 

163
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,910
we say strike the back leg
okay that means he's going to just draw

164
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
okay that means he's going to just draw
 

165
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,670
okay that means he's going to just draw
a line across so he's going to step

166
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
a line across so he's going to step
 

167
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,630
a line across so he's going to step
through

168
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
through
 

169
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,670
through
and

170
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680

 

171
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,629

he's not going to strike the front leg

172
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
he's not going to strike the front leg
 

173
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,030
he's not going to strike the front leg
okay and kihon you can change it and do

174
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
okay and kihon you can change it and do
 

175

the first skill that i want
is

286
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
is
 

287
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,309
is

know where he's going
 

289
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,390
know where he's going
look for weight shifting look for

290
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
look for weight shifting look for
 

291
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,950
look for weight shifting look for
shoulder changing angles look for

292
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
shoulder changing angles look for
 

293
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,469
shoulder changing angles look for
inhalations look for nostrils flaring

294
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
inhalations look for nostrils flaring
 

295
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,749
inhalations look for nostrils flaring
eyes opening you have to have that

296
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
eyes opening you have to have that
 

297
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,990
eyes opening you have to have that
because you can't wait till you see the

298
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
because you can't wait till you see the
 

299
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,909
because you can't wait till you see the
strike you're gonna break the first one

300
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
strike you're gonna break the first one
 

301
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,990
strike you're gonna break the first one
of the first two rules probably number

302
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
of the first two rules probably number
 

303
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,390
of the first two rules probably number
two you're going to block it okay

304
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
two you're going to block it okay
 

305
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,189
two you're going to block it okay
so

306
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
so
 

307
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,070
so
first skill as he goes you read the body

308
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
first skill as he goes you read the body
 

309
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,909
first skill as he goes you read the body
so you know

310
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
so you know
 

311
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,870
so you know
and then the second skill is you match

312
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
and then the second skill is you match
 

313
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,350
and then the second skill is you match
yin and yang so the only opening for

314
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
yin and yang so the only opening for
 

315
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,629
yin and yang so the only opening for
showman in this case is when it's going

316
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
showman in this case is when it's going
 

317
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,550
showman in this case is when it's going
up that's the yin energy that's when i

318
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
up that's the yin energy that's when i
 

319
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,270
up that's the yin energy that's when i
can edie me without breaking rule number

320
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
can edie me without breaking rule number
 

321
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,029
can edie me without breaking rule number
two

322
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
two
 

323
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,870
two
so it goes up

324
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
so it goes up
 

325
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,230
so it goes up
and i catch it going up

326
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
and i catch it going up
 

327
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,670
and i catch it going up
i won't even talk about what i'm doing

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:56,070
backward
we won't deal with the injury

342
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080

 

343
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,309

okay let's try it go

344
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319

 

345
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,230

okay so the last point is what to not do

346
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
okay so the last point is what to not do
 

347
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,430
okay so the last point is what to not do
though like uh not having to be a strike

348
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
though like uh not having to be a strike
 

349
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,629
though like uh not having to be a strike
blocking stopping those are all wrong

350
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
blocking stopping those are all wrong
 

351
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,150
blocking stopping those are all wrong
that's not aikido flat out got it so you

352
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
that's not aikido flat out got it so you
 

353
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,589
that's not aikido flat out got it so you
want to learn aikido don't do those

354
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
want to learn aikido don't do those
 

355

things
 

357
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,790
things
and then it creates the possibility for

358
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
and then it creates the possibility for
 

359
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,430
and then it creates the possibility for
this other yin yang reconciliation

360
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
this other yin yang reconciliation
 

361
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,629
this other yin yang reconciliation
there's only one yin spot on shomonucci

362
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
there's only one yin spot on shomonucci
 

363
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,510
there's only one yin spot on shomonucci
in this case and it's when he goes up so

364
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
in this case and it's when he goes up so
 

365
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,510
in this case and it's when he goes up so
i have to read the body so i can take

366
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
i have to read the body so i can take
 

367
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,990
i have to read the body so i can take
advantage of the opening when it goes up

368
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
advantage of the opening when it goes up
 

369
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,949
advantage of the opening when it goes up
okay

370
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
okay
 

371
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,630
okay
um

um
 

373
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,430
um
that's what's last point okay this point

374
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
that's what's last point okay this point
 

375
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,350

what that is is opening triangles

390
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
what that is is opening triangles
 

391
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,509
what that is is opening triangles
dominating the center line so you're

392
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
dominating the center line so you're
 

393
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,509
dominating the center line so you're
going to do the same thing now you don't

394
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
going to do the same thing now you don't
 

395
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,509

you understand so don't open yourself up

416
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
you understand so don't open yourself up
 

417
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,350
you understand so don't open yourself up
keep yourself close so arm positioning

418
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
keep yourself close so arm positioning
 

419
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,990
keep yourself close so arm positioning
is here

420
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
is here

with the other hand

422
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
with the other hand
 

423
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,110
with the other hand
in the hand sword position at the tricep

424
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
in the hand sword position at the tricep

tendon of insertion

426
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
tendon of insertion
 

427
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,430
tendon of insertion
and the other hand is above that so the

428
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
and the other hand is above that so the
 

429
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,150
and the other hand is above that so the
two hands are working in conjunction

430
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
two hands are working in conjunction
 

431
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,030
two hands are working in conjunction
okay

432
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
okay
 

433
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,550
okay
if you're here

in the echo grab at the beginning

436
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
in the echo grab at the beginning
 

437
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,710
in the echo grab at the beginning
the other hand is below the elbow

438
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
the other hand is below the elbow
 

439
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,110
the other hand is below the elbow
that's not good because i'm on the

440
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
that's not good because i'm on the
 

441
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,990
that's not good because i'm on the
outside of the arm for example

442
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
outside of the arm for example
 

443
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,150
outside of the arm for example
if i do it over here let's just look at

444
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
if i do it over here let's just look at
 

445
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,430
if i do it over here let's just look at
this common mistake okay

446
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
this common mistake okay
 

447
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,110
this common mistake okay
i'm doing my control at the wrist

448
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
i'm doing my control at the wrist
 

449
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,350
i'm doing my control at the wrist
while you're doing that okay

450
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
while you're doing that okay
 

451
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,829
while you're doing that okay
how did you get there there's only one

452
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
how did you get there there's only one
 

453
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,990
how did you get there there's only one
way

454
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
way
 

455
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,030
way
i can't reach the wrist if i was

456
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
i can't reach the wrist if i was
 

457
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,430
i can't reach the wrist if i was
entering on the inn do you see there's

458
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
entering on the inn do you see there's
 

459
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,550
entering on the inn do you see there's
no way

460
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
no way
 

461
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,949
no way
so what do you think you did

462
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
so what do you think you did
 

463
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,710
so what do you think you did
you clashed

464
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
you clashed
 

465
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,110
you clashed
do you think

466
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
do you think
 

467
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,269
do you think
and in that class you also break the

468
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
and in that class you also break the
 

469
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,750
and in that class you also break the
rule right now on the outside of the arm

470
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
rule right now on the outside of the arm
 

471
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,990
rule right now on the outside of the arm
you need to be above the elbow in order

472
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
you need to be above the elbow in order
 

473
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,630
you need to be above the elbow in order
to generate the angle cancellation if

474
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
to generate the angle cancellation if
 

475
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,470
to generate the angle cancellation if
you're above that if you're below the

476
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
you're above that if you're below the
 

477
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,509
you're above that if you're below the
elbow then he can bend around it okay

478
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
elbow then he can bend around it okay
 

479
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,949
elbow then he can bend around it okay
so same thing if he's on the outside and

480
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
so same thing if he's on the outside and
 

481
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,509
so same thing if he's on the outside and
he only holds the wrist like a check and

482
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
he only holds the wrist like a check and
 

483
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,310
he only holds the wrist like a check and
it's easy to get around it same thing

484
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
it's easy to get around it same thing
 

485
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,470
it's easy to get around it same thing
he's at the wrist you're boom it's easy

486
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
he's at the wrist you're boom it's easy
 

487
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,269
he's at the wrist you're boom it's easy
to get around it happens instantly

488
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
to get around it happens instantly
 

489
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,790
to get around it happens instantly
and it hits okay

490
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
and it hits okay
 

491
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,030
and it hits okay
so whenever you're on the outside you

492
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
so whenever you're on the outside you
 

493
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,470
so whenever you're on the outside you
have to be at the elbow and i can't get

494
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
have to be at the elbow and i can't get
 

495
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,350
have to be at the elbow and i can't get
this joint to go around it it can't heal

496
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
this joint to go around it it can't heal
 

497
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,150
this joint to go around it it can't heal
without creating further opening

498
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
without creating further opening
 

499
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,949
without creating further opening
so

500
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
so
 

501
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,870
so
don't be on the wrist

502
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
don't be on the wrist
 

503
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,630
don't be on the wrist
it's not going to be right because you

504
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
it's not going to be right because you
 

505

once you get your admin entry angle okay
 

659
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,430

going to be the inertial resistance
 

663
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,829
going to be the inertial resistance
you're using it okay go

664
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839

okay
it is more marginally viable to control

674
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
it is more marginally viable to control
 

675
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,389
it is more marginally viable to control
his

676
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
his
 

677
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,470
his
center of gravity his balance his

678
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
center of gravity his balance his
 

679
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,949
center of gravity his balance his
posture spine

680
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
posture spine
 

681
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,870
posture spine
than to control his arms

682
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
than to control his arms
 

683
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,670
than to control his arms
okay so that's what you're doing you're

684
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
okay so that's what you're doing you're

not attacking his arm i am touching his

686
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
not attacking his arm i am touching his
 

687
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,629
not attacking his arm i am touching his
arm but i'm not attacking his arm i'm

688
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
arm but i'm not attacking his arm i'm
 

689
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,069
arm but i'm not attacking his arm i'm
getting his balance and getting his

690
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
getting his balance and getting his
 

691
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,110
getting his balance and getting his
center okay you have to understand that

692
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
center okay you have to understand that
 

693
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,590
center okay you have to understand that
you have to not go

694
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
you have to not go
 

695
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,350
you have to not go
and try some arm techniques

696
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
and try some arm techniques
 

697
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,870
and try some arm techniques
okay

698
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
okay
 

699
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,829
okay
so he's much stronger than me and

700
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
so he's much stronger than me and
 

701
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,030
so he's much stronger than me and
um

702
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
um
 

703
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,949
um
you see you go oh

704
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
you see you go oh
 

705
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,470
you see you go oh
i get it

706
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
i get it
 

707
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,389
i get it
full grown lever

708
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
full grown lever
 

709
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,990
full grown lever
okay so he's got fulcrum and lever got

710
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
okay so he's got fulcrum and lever got
 

711
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,069
okay so he's got fulcrum and lever got
it and he's gonna

712
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
it and he's gonna
 

713
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,230
it and he's gonna
get me down go ahead

714
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
get me down go ahead
 

715
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,269
get me down go ahead
go ahead

716
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
go ahead
 

717
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,829
go ahead
and even this little strength difference

718
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
and even this little strength difference
 

719
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,910
and even this little strength difference
uh he can't do it

720
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
uh he can't do it
 

721
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,829
uh he can't do it
no one can do it all you're going to do

722
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
no one can do it all you're going to do
 

723
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,189
no one can do it all you're going to do
is try it for real and you're going to

724
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
is try it for real and you're going to
 

725
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,590
is try it for real and you're going to
say that that didn't work okay and

726
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
say that that didn't work okay and
 

727
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,189
say that that didn't work okay and
you don't have to say

728
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
you don't have to say
 

729
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,350
you don't have to say
that the little 80 pound

730
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
that the little 80 pound
 

731
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,189
that the little 80 pound
drunk girl in heels that you're trying

732
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
drunk girl in heels that you're trying
 

733
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,590
drunk girl in heels that you're trying
to arrest for public intoxication was on

734
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
to arrest for public intoxication was on
 

735
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,030
to arrest for public intoxication was on
pcp it just doesn't work okay

736
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
pcp it just doesn't work okay
 

737
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,189
pcp it just doesn't work okay
the other thing is this

738
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
the other thing is this
 

739
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,949
the other thing is this
every fulcrum and lever

740
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959

 

741
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,590

has its ideal positioning in order to

742
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
has its ideal positioning in order to
 

743
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,470
has its ideal positioning in order to
maximize its force output

744
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
maximize its force output
 

745
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,509
maximize its force output
that requires the fight to stop moving

746
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
that requires the fight to stop moving
 

747
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,670
that requires the fight to stop moving
that breaks the rules of fighting fights

748
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
that breaks the rules of fighting fights
 

749
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,749
that breaks the rules of fighting fights
don't stop moving okay

750
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
don't stop moving okay
 

751
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,629
don't stop moving okay
so if i stay still go ahead

752
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
so if i stay still go ahead
 

753
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,949
so if i stay still go ahead
and it's still not you try your hardest

754
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
and it's still not you try your hardest
 

755
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,189
and it's still not you try your hardest
it's still not enough to overcome me

756
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
it's still not enough to overcome me
 

757
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,789
it's still not enough to overcome me
even though you can

758
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
even though you can
 

759
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,590
even though you can
kill me on the bench press okay

760
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
kill me on the bench press okay
 

761
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,990
kill me on the bench press okay
but once i start moving i'm going to

762
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
but once i start moving i'm going to
 

763
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,069
but once i start moving i'm going to
change this idea i'll go ahead and admit

764
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
change this idea i'll go ahead and admit
 

765
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,549
change this idea i'll go ahead and admit
and it requires even less output on my

766
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
and it requires even less output on my
 

767
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,390
and it requires even less output on my
part to overcome that engine do you

768
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
part to overcome that engine do you
 

769
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,390
part to overcome that engine do you
understand okay so

770
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400

 

771
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,510

therefore

772
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
therefore
 

773
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,309
therefore
do not try fulcrum lever on the arm it

774
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
do not try fulcrum lever on the arm it
 

775
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,110
do not try fulcrum lever on the arm it
does not work okay and it's not better

776
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
does not work okay and it's not better
 

777
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,110
does not work okay and it's not better
than what we're doing

778
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
than what we're doing
 

779
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,390
than what we're doing
so

780
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
so
 

781
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,630
so
don't

782
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
don't
 

783
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,789
don't
try to hit that wrist

784
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
try to hit that wrist
 

785
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,909
try to hit that wrist
and try to do that do you see that

786
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
and try to do that do you see that
 

787
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,710
and try to do that do you see that
in any of your sneaky ways

788
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
in any of your sneaky ways
 

789
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,110
in any of your sneaky ways
here

790
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
here
 

791
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,909
here
no

792
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
no
 

793
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,270
no
don't do it

794
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
don't do it
 

795
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,230
don't do it
attack the center attack the sensor in

796
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
attack the center attack the sensor in
 

797
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,950
attack the center attack the sensor in
here attack the center

798
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
here attack the center
 

799
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,230
here attack the center
that's your goal

800
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
that's your goal
 

801
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,150
that's your goal
if you have to think i'm not doing ikyo

802
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
if you have to think i'm not doing ikyo
 

803
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,909
if you have to think i'm not doing ikyo
then think you're not doing eco and just

804
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
then think you're not doing eco and just
 

805
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,950
then think you're not doing eco and just
do a new technique okay

806
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
do a new technique okay
 

807
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,669
do a new technique okay
so center there's your adhesion right

808
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
so center there's your adhesion right
 

809
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,750
so center there's your adhesion right
your eye adhesion you see i'm not i

810
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
your eye adhesion you see i'm not i
 

811
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,029
your eye adhesion you see i'm not i
don't need to do that because i don't

812
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
don't need to do that because i don't
 

813
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,150
don't need to do that because i don't
need to do that i'm using his energy

814
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
need to do that i'm using his energy
 

815
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,710
need to do that i'm using his energy
his inertia was going forward it's

816
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
his inertia was going forward it's
 

817
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,549
his inertia was going forward it's
pushing into this hand there's no need

818
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
pushing into this hand there's no need
 

819
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,669
pushing into this hand there's no need
to grab it

820
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
to grab it
 

821
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,510
to grab it
there's no need it just guide it around

822
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
there's no need it just guide it around
 

823
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,510
there's no need it just guide it around
what am i doing here if i'm not grabbing

824
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
what am i doing here if i'm not grabbing
 

825
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,750
what am i doing here if i'm not grabbing
it i'm staying with it

no push pull
try to chill on your grabbing

844
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
try to chill on your grabbing
 

845
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,430
try to chill on your grabbing
and get your adhesion going instead

846
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
and get your adhesion going instead
 

847
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,110
and get your adhesion going instead
attack the center

848
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
attack the center
 

849
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,590
attack the center
use his inertial progress

850
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
use his inertial progress
 

851
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,549
use his inertial progress
to create the adhesion attack the sun

852
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
to create the adhesion attack the sun
 

853
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,150
to create the adhesion attack the sun
okay

854
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
okay
 

855
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,870
okay
it's going back a little bit i mentioned

856
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
it's going back a little bit i mentioned
 

857
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,029
it's going back a little bit i mentioned
it that you're using an eye candheation

858
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
it that you're using an eye candheation
 

859
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,430
it that you're using an eye candheation
to get that energy to come around you

860
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
to get that energy to come around you
 

861
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,669
to get that energy to come around you
and that's what's sticking his arm to

862
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
and that's what's sticking his arm to
 

863
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,470
and that's what's sticking his arm to
your

864
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
your
 

865
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,430
your
hands

866
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
hands
 

867
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,430
hands
you don't need to grab it okay

868
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440

 

869
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,350

definitely why you don't want to do an

870
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
definitely why you don't want to do an
 

871
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,950
definitely why you don't want to do an
inferior method of fulcrum lever okay

872
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
inferior method of fulcrum lever okay
 

873
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,750
inferior method of fulcrum lever okay
so

874
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
so
 

875
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,789
so
in order to do an id adhesion his energy

876
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
in order to do an id adhesion his energy
 

877
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,230
in order to do an id adhesion his energy
has to go into the ground you see so

878
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
has to go into the ground you see so
 

879
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,789
has to go into the ground you see so
he's he's pushing you can push he's

880
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
he's he's pushing you can push he's
 

881
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,950
he's he's pushing you can push he's
pushing backwards right and that

882
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
pushing backwards right and that
 

883
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,950
pushing backwards right and that
energy's in the ground

884
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
energy's in the ground
 

885
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,310
energy's in the ground
as i'm moving

886
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
as i'm moving
 

887
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,950
as i'm moving
it's not me bracing on it not me bracing

888
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
it's not me bracing on it not me bracing
 

889
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,950
it's not me bracing on it not me bracing
on it okay this energy is

890
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
on it okay this energy is
 

891
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,310
on it okay this energy is
in the ground and that's as it turns

892
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
in the ground and that's as it turns
 

893
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,029
in the ground and that's as it turns
right that's what's allowing it

894
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
right that's what's allowing it
 

895
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,310
right that's what's allowing it
to go around

896
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
to go around
 

897
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,710
to go around
so you can't you can't do lurch stepping

898
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
so you can't you can't do lurch stepping
 

899
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,270
so you can't you can't do lurch stepping
you see that it can't be that so you're

900
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
you see that it can't be that so you're
 

901
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,630
you see that it can't be that so you're
going to go

902
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
going to go
 

903
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,270
going to go
from one mid foot vector

904
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
from one mid foot vector
 

905
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,950
from one mid foot vector
on the rear foot

906
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960

909
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,590
to the other
you see

910
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
you see
 

911
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,230
you see
and you stay on that

912
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
and you stay on that
 

913
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,149
and you stay on that
midfoot vector

914
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
midfoot vector
 

915
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,390
midfoot vector
so you can't merge

916
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
so you can't merge
 

917
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,669
so you can't merge

943
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,350

you can't just walk

944
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
you can't just walk
 

945
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,549
you can't just walk
boom

946
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
boom
 

947
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,270
boom
in

948
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280

 

949
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,590

the technique is a threat constantly to

950
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
the technique is a threat constantly to
 

951
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,430
the technique is a threat constantly to
the center

952
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
the center
 

953
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,070
the center
remember not arm to control center

954
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
remember not arm to control center
 

955
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,669
remember not arm to control center
center to control arm okay

956
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
center to control arm okay
 

957
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,310
center to control arm okay
so that means attack the center

958
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
so that means attack the center
 

959
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,789
so that means attack the center
attachment and attack the center

960
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
attachment and attack the center
 

961
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,590
attachment and attack the center
do not come off the center

962
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600

 

963
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,350

this will answer the question well how

964
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
this will answer the question well how
 

965
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,430
this will answer the question well how
does the arm stay in place

966
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
does the arm stay in place
 

967
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,230
does the arm stay in place
how does it stick to me inertially at

968
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
how does it stick to me inertially at
 

969
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,590
how does it stick to me inertially at
the beginning

970
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
the beginning
 

971
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,310
the beginning
because it was going that way and here

972
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
because it was going that way and here
 

973
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,909
because it was going that way and here
because i'm going

974
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
because i'm going
 

975
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,830
because i'm going
into the arm got it i'm going into the

976
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
into the arm got it i'm going into the
 

977
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,909
into the arm got it i'm going into the
center the arm will stay in place

978
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
center the arm will stay in place
 

979
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,710
center the arm will stay in place
so you're going to go boom

980
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
so you're going to go boom
 

981
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,710
so you're going to go boom
i'm going to go

982
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
i'm going to go
 

983
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,750
i'm going to go
into the arm this is the arm

984
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760

 

985
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,190

you're going to look for

986
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
you're going to look for
 

987
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,710
you're going to look for
the center

988
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
the center
 

989
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,990
the center
you're going to look for this attackable

990
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
you're going to look for this attackable
 

991
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,190
you're going to look for this attackable
angle

992
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200

 

993
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,630

pull

994
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
pull
 

995
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,390
pull
down this angle

996
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400

 

997
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,230

do not think table and legs do not think

998
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
do not think table and legs do not think
 

999
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,750
do not think table and legs do not think
table and legs

1000
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
table and legs
 

1001
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,390
table and legs
so don't go on

1002
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
so don't go on
 

1003
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,710
so don't go on
pull off his balance

1004
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
pull off his balance
 

1005
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,110
pull off his balance
pull him off his balance i'm not pulling

1006
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
pull him off his balance i'm not pulling
 

1007
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,270
pull him off his balance i'm not pulling
him off his bounce i'm taking the whole

1008
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
him off his bounce i'm taking the whole
 

1009
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,430
him off his bounce i'm taking the whole
table and i'm just flipping the whole

1010
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
table and i'm just flipping the whole
 

1011
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,590
table and i'm just flipping the whole
table over okay

1012
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
table over okay
 

1013
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,470
table over okay
so

1014
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
so
 

1015
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,870
so
in

1016
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880

 

1017
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,350

think of this outer knee

1018
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
think of this outer knee
 

1019
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,590
think of this outer knee
being on the line of attack

1020
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
being on the line of attack
 

1021
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,350
being on the line of attack
of his face

1022
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
of his face
 

1023
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,549
of his face
if you need a reference point

1024
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559

 

1025
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,669

right in line of attack

1026
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
right in line of attack
 

1027
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,070
right in line of attack

this can't be it
okay and then opens the door for the

1098
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
okay and then opens the door for the
 

1099
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,549
okay and then opens the door for the
possibilities

1100
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
possibilities
 

1101
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,870
possibilities
i there is a place where i neither push

1102
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
i there is a place where i neither push
 

1103
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,630
i there is a place where i neither push

okay
 

1107
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,710
okay
so for example

1108
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
so for example
 

1109
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,149
so for example
where

1110
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
where
 

1111
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,230
where
i don't need to

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
i don't need to
 

1113
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,750
i don't need to
grab the arms to keep the arms

1114
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
grab the arms to keep the arms
 

1115
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,549
grab the arms to keep the arms
do you see the only reason i'm i need to

1116
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
do you see the only reason i'm i need to
 

1117
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,390
do you see the only reason i'm i need to
grab to keep the arms is i'm behind i'm

1118
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
grab to keep the arms is i'm behind i'm
 

1119
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,470
grab to keep the arms is i'm behind i'm
behind in my mind if i were to stay up i

1120
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
behind in my mind if i were to stay up i
 

1121
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,870
behind in my mind if i were to stay up i
don't need to grab the arms to keep the

1122
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
don't need to grab the arms to keep the
 

1123
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,470
don't need to grab the arms to keep the
arms do you see that but you have to

1124
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
arms do you see that but you have to
 

1125
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,269
arms do you see that but you have to
open yourself up to that possibility

1126
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
open yourself up to that possibility
 

1127
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,190
open yourself up to that possibility
okay

1128
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
okay
 

1129
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,350
okay
and you change things you ask the

1130
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
and you change things you ask the
 

1131
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,750
and you change things you ask the
question how do i keep up with the arms

1132
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
question how do i keep up with the arms
 

1133
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,990
question how do i keep up with the arms
such that i'm not behind such that i do

1134
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
such that i'm not behind such that i do
 

1135
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,549
such that i'm not behind such that i do
not have to pull the arms to keep the

1136
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
not have to pull the arms to keep the
 

1137
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,950
not have to pull the arms to keep the
arms you got it

1138
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
arms you got it
 

1139
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,269
arms you got it
so i gave you that angle of entry which

1140
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
so i gave you that angle of entry which
 

1141
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,310
so i gave you that angle of entry which
makes more sense okay

1142
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
makes more sense okay
 

1143
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,669
makes more sense okay
meaning

1144
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
meaning

you can't have that understanding as

1196
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
you can't have that understanding as
 

1197
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,590
you can't have that understanding as
you're playing with these sources but

1198
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
you're playing with these sources but
 

1199
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,310
you're playing with these sources but
you want to not do that anymore you want

1200
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
you want to not do that anymore you want
 

1201
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,230
you want to not do that anymore you want
to understand once you understand these

1202
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
to understand once you understand these
 

1203
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,350
to understand once you understand these
sources you want to just use them that

1204
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
sources you want to just use them that
 

1205
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,669
sources you want to just use them that
that's what governs the technique not my

1206
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
that's what governs the technique not my
 

1207
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,350
that's what governs the technique not my
foot patterns

1208
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
foot patterns
 

1209
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,070
foot patterns
which are based upon some imagery which

1210
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
which are based upon some imagery which
 

1211
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,950
which are based upon some imagery which
may

1212
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
may
 

1213
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,070
may
not be

1214
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
not be
 

1215
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,789
not be
what you were actually doing okay

1216
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
what you were actually doing okay
 

1217
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,750
what you were actually doing okay
so

1218
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
so
 

1219
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,710
so
uh when he enters this technique is done

1220
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
uh when he enters this technique is done
 

1221
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,570
uh when he enters this technique is done
that's what i'm looking for here

1222
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:08,580
that's what i'm looking for here
 

1223
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,950
that's what i'm looking for here
[Music]

1224
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
[Music]
 

1225
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:20,470
[Music]
that's the same technique

1226
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480

 

1227
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,110

much quicker much shorter

1228
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120

 

1229
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,230

not here

1230
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240

 

1231
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,950

it's much done

1232
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
it's much done
 

1233
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,070
it's much done
done right away so you can boom hit him

1234
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
done right away so you can boom hit him
 

1235
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,630
done right away so you can boom hit him
and keep moving past him if you wanted

1236
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
and keep moving past him if you wanted
 

1237
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,549
and keep moving past him if you wanted
to okay

1238
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
to okay
 

1239
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,310
to okay
so

1240
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
so
 

1241
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,350
so
see if we can reduce it to at least

1242
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
see if we can reduce it to at least
 

1243
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,190
see if we can reduce it to at least
want to tell me

1244
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
want to tell me
 

1245
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,190
want to tell me
shoot from halfway

1246
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
shoot from halfway
 

1247
00:27:51,200 --> 00:29:57,750
shoot from halfway
okay

1248
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760

 

1249
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,029

okay

1250
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039

 

1251
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,350

let's talk about the pin

1252
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
let's talk about the pin
 

1253
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,710
let's talk about the pin
okay

1254
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
okay
 

1255
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,710
okay
you're going to see a different

1256
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
you're going to see a different
 

1257
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,310
you're going to see a different
perspective

1258
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
perspective
 

1259
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,029
perspective
leads to an entirely different technique

1260
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
leads to an entirely different technique
 

1261
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,710
leads to an entirely different technique
but you have to look closely because you

1262
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:12,720
but you have to look closely because you
 

1263
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,470
but you have to look closely because you
guys have been staring at that technique

1264
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
guys have been staring at that technique
 

1265
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,389
guys have been staring at that technique
for decades now and some of you are

1266
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
for decades now and some of you are
 

1267
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,230
for decades now and some of you are
still doing the mistakes that are

1268
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
still doing the mistakes that are
 

1269
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,990
still doing the mistakes that are
overtly taught

1270
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
overtly taught
 

1271
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,029
overtly taught
block clash it's not a strike from luke

1272
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
block clash it's not a strike from luke
 

1273
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,190
block clash it's not a strike from luke
it's a strike from you you don't have to

1274
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
it's a strike from you you don't have to
 

1275
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,750
it's a strike from you you don't have to
read the body it's actually jodon's ski

1276
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
read the body it's actually jodon's ski
 

1277
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,830
read the body it's actually jodon's ski
they're just hanging out there you push

1278
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
they're just hanging out there you push
 

1279
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,310
they're just hanging out there you push
and pull you do inferior engines like

1280
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
and pull you do inferior engines like
 

1281
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,310
and pull you do inferior engines like
fulcrum and lever you attack the arm

1282
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
fulcrum and lever you attack the arm
 

1283
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,350
fulcrum and lever you attack the arm
detect the center all that is wrong

1284
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
detect the center all that is wrong
 

1285
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,990
detect the center all that is wrong
but it's a different technique

1286
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
but it's a different technique
 

1287
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,029
but it's a different technique
it's not the art it's not marshall

1288
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
it's not the art it's not marshall
 

1289
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,470
it's not the art it's not marshall
okay

1290
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
okay
 

1291
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,269
okay
you do the pin different too

1292
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279

 

1293
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,870

no i'm just here

1294
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880

 

1295
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,669

it was one ikey adhesion from the first

1296
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
it was one ikey adhesion from the first
 

1297
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,870
it was one ikey adhesion from the first
contact if you remember okay i'm not

1298
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
contact if you remember okay i'm not
 

1299
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,590
contact if you remember okay i'm not
pulling nor pushing but he can't get on

1300
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600
pulling nor pushing but he can't get on
 

1301
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,909
pulling nor pushing but he can't get on
off of me there's no gap here do you

1302
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
off of me there's no gap here do you
 

1303
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,389
off of me there's no gap here do you
understand so i'm doing the same thing

1304
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:06,399
understand so i'm doing the same thing
 

1305
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,190
understand so i'm doing the same thing
here at the end

1306
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
here at the end
 

1307
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,149
here at the end
i am not

1308
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159

 

1309
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,070

going to hurt him

1310
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080

 

1311
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,950

and then he taps out

1312
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
and then he taps out
 

1313
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,909
and then he taps out
why

1314
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
why
 

1315
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,389
why
that's called pain compliance

1316
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
that's called pain compliance
 

1317
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,389
that's called pain compliance
pain compliance is as marginally

1318
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
pain compliance is as marginally
 

1319
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,430
pain compliance is as marginally
ineffective as fulcrum and lever

1320
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
ineffective as fulcrum and lever
 

1321
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,470
ineffective as fulcrum and lever
does not work who's it work on

1322
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
does not work who's it work on
 

1323
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,950
does not work who's it work on
it works on voices

1324
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
it works on voices
 

1325
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,750
it works on voices
it works for non-angry people

1326
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
it works for non-angry people
 

1327
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,630
it works for non-angry people
that's probably not who's attacking you

1328
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
that's probably not who's attacking you
 

1329
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,029
that's probably not who's attacking you
so you don't get in the habit or the

1330
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
so you don't get in the habit or the
 

1331
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,750
so you don't get in the habit or the
assumption that you can hurt people

1332
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
assumption that you can hurt people
 

1333
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,350
assumption that you can hurt people
into quitting

1334
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
into quitting
 

1335
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,070
into quitting
you want control instead

1336
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080

 

1337
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,470

when i'm here what is the control the

1338
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
when i'm here what is the control the
 

1339
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,029
when i'm here what is the control the
control is the adhesion

1340
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:55,039
control is the adhesion
 

1341
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,470
control is the adhesion
okay

1342
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
okay
 

1343
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,710
okay
i take the adhesion and i'm going to

1344
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
i take the adhesion and i'm going to
 

1345
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,909
i take the adhesion and i'm going to
transfer it internally

1346
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
transfer it internally
 

1347
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,789
transfer it internally
to

1348
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
to
 

1349
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,590
to
caulk you

1350
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600

 

1351
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,350

because they're sourced from the same

1352
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,360
because they're sourced from the same
 

1353
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,710
because they're sourced from the same
thing

1354
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
thing
 

1355
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,990
thing
so

1356
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
so
 

1357
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,310
so
as i go

1358
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
as i go
 

1359
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,269
as i go
he can't lift up

1360
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
he can't lift up
 

1361
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,470
he can't lift up
but i'm not really

1362
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480

 

1363
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,310

he can't lift up

1364
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
he can't lift up
 

1365
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,389
he can't lift up
so that's what he's going to do

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
and the uke goes into la la land got it
 

1495
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,190
and the uke goes into la la land got it
okay

okay
 

1497
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,910
okay
let's try

1498
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920

 

1499
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,150

koku and ikey you want an understanding

1500
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
koku and ikey you want an understanding
 

1501
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,829
koku and ikey you want an understanding
of them right

1502
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
of them right
 

1503
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,190
of them right
and

1504
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
and
 

1505
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,109
and
you don't realize that

1506
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
you don't realize that
 

1507
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,349
you don't realize that
your questions

1508
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
your questions
 

1509
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,150
your questions
on them are dichotomous

1510
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
on them are dichotomous
 

1511
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,750
on them are dichotomous
okay and the lesson is introduced

1512
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
okay and the lesson is introduced
 

1513
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,069
okay and the lesson is introduced
in terms of a dichotomy

1514
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
in terms of a dichotomy
 

1515
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,990
in terms of a dichotomy
but the dichotomy is false it is it is a

1516
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
but the dichotomy is false it is it is a
 

1517
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,510
but the dichotomy is false it is it is a
narrative it is a it is a poem that's to

and then you'll understand

1534
00:35:59,430 --> 00:35:59,440
and then you'll understand
 

1535
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,430
and then you'll understand
these internal aspects because they're

1536
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
these internal aspects because they're
 

1537
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,750
these internal aspects because they're
lost from aikido so cross-train in tai

1538
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
lost from aikido so cross-train in tai
 

1539
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,270
lost from aikido so cross-train in tai
chi i do not recommend that because

1540
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280

 

1541
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,030

two reasons

1542
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
two reasons
 

1543
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,550
two reasons
one

1544
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
one
 

1545
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,270
one
even in tai chi there are

1546
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
even in tai chi there are
 

1547
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,069
even in tai chi there are
more people who never get it than do get

1548
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
more people who never get it than do get
 

1549
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,510
more people who never get it than do get
it okay

1550
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
it okay
 

1551
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,790
it okay
and two

1552
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
and two
 

1553
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,030
and two
your ultimate aim

1554
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
your ultimate aim
 

1555
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,190
your ultimate aim
is a

1556
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,200
is a
 

1557
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,910
is a
reconciliation of the dichotomy the

1558
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
reconciliation of the dichotomy the
 

1559
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,270
reconciliation of the dichotomy the
disappearance of all paradox okay so if

1560
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
disappearance of all paradox okay so if
 

1561
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,390
disappearance of all paradox okay so if
that if i have to do that to over

1562
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,400
that if i have to do that to over
 

1563
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,109
that if i have to do that to over
complicate what i'm doing with an

1564
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
complicate what i'm doing with an
 

1565
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,069
complicate what i'm doing with an
abundance or an infinite amount of

1566
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
abundance or an infinite amount of
 

1567
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,670
abundance or an infinite amount of
correspondences

1568
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
correspondences
 

1569
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,349
correspondences
just further and further and further

1570
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
just further and further and further
 

1571
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,150
just further and further and further
down the dichotomy rabbit hole i do not

1572
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
down the dichotomy rabbit hole i do not
 

1573
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,430
down the dichotomy rabbit hole i do not
find that you are served by that okay

1574
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
find that you are served by that okay
 

1575
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,390
find that you are served by that okay
so

1576
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
so
 

1577
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,349
so
if you

1578
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:51,359
if you
 

1579
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,510
if you
what you ultimately have while i might

1580
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
what you ultimately have while i might
 

1581
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,230
what you ultimately have while i might
talk about a ikea and a call cube

1582
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
talk about a ikea and a call cube
 

1583
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,430
talk about a ikea and a call cube
remember it's the yin-yang model so the

1584
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,440
remember it's the yin-yang model so the
 

1585
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,710
remember it's the yin-yang model so the
yin and the yang are born from the dao

1586
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
yin and the yang are born from the dao
 

1587
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,710
yin and the yang are born from the dao
they come from the same thing there's

1588
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:04,720
they come from the same thing there's
 

1589
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,589
they come from the same thing there's
one thing you see they're not two things

1590
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
one thing you see they're not two things
 

1591
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,270
one thing you see they're not two things
that are totally separate from each

1592
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
that are totally separate from each
 

1593
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,710
that are totally separate from each
other uh they have the same source and

1594
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,720
other uh they have the same source and
 

1595
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,030
other uh they have the same source and
even in the diagram there's always a

1596
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
even in the diagram there's always a
 

1597
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,310
even in the diagram there's always a
little that's in the other one okay so

1598
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
little that's in the other one okay so
 

1599
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,870
little that's in the other one okay so
there's no such thing as pure idea or

1600
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
there's no such thing as pure idea or
 

1601
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,349
there's no such thing as pure idea or
poor

1602
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
poor
 

1603
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,069
poor
all right you're kind of using this very

1604
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,079
all right you're kind of using this very
 

1605
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,349
all right you're kind of using this very
simple

1606
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
simple
 

1607
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,510
simple
just like the data chain there's yin and

1608
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
just like the data chain there's yin and
 

1609
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,030
just like the data chain there's yin and
yang and then what did they poet say and

1610
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
yang and then what did they poet say and
 

1611
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,069
yang and then what did they poet say and
from there they 10 000 myriad things

1612
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
from there they 10 000 myriad things
 

1613
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,670
from there they 10 000 myriad things
arose ten thousand is the chinese uh

1614
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
arose ten thousand is the chinese uh
 

1615
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,390
arose ten thousand is the chinese uh
pre-modern number for infinity

1616
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
pre-modern number for infinity
 

1617
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,829
pre-modern number for infinity
everything else comes from this

1618
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:43,839
everything else comes from this
 

1619
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,470
everything else comes from this
combination which is ultimately from one

1620
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
combination which is ultimately from one
 

1621
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,790
combination which is ultimately from one
source okay so there's no need to go

1622
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
source okay so there's no need to go
 

1623
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,950
source okay so there's no need to go
into all the different gin there's no

1624
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
into all the different gin there's no
 

1625
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,270
into all the different gin there's no
need to go into pong there's just no

1626
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
need to go into pong there's just no
 

1627
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,270
need to go into pong there's just no
need for that if you if you understand

1628
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
need for that if you if you understand
 

1629
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
need for that if you if you understand
what you're doing you would eventually

1630
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
what you're doing you would eventually
 

1631
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,430
what you're doing you would eventually
have to get rid of those things anyways

1632
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
have to get rid of those things anyways
 

1633
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,430
have to get rid of those things anyways
okay so for example let's do we'll just

1634
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
okay so for example let's do we'll just
 

1635
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,150
okay so for example let's do we'll just
say uh administrative now so his strike

1636
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,160
say uh administrative now so his strike
 

1637
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,910
say uh administrative now so his strike
is coming up right

1638
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
is coming up right
 

1639
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,990
is coming up right
and um

1640
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,000
and um
 

1641
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,109
and um
i am

1642
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:11,119
i am
 

1643
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,990
i am
having this this energy his inertia is

1644
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
having this this energy his inertia is
 

1645
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,870
having this this energy his inertia is
going that way and i use that energy to

1646
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
going that way and i use that energy to
 

1647
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,950
going that way and i use that energy to
create the friction that goes around me

1648
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
create the friction that goes around me
 

1649
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,310
create the friction that goes around me
do you see that

1650
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,320
do you see that
 

1651
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,150
do you see that
that is

1652
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
that is
 

1653
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,870
that is
ikey it's a communion between my hand

1654
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
ikey it's a communion between my hand
 

1655
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,190
ikey it's a communion between my hand
and his hand do you see and that energy

1656
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
and his hand do you see and that energy
 

1657
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,829
and his hand do you see and that energy
is going around me you got it but if you

1658
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:29,839
is going around me you got it but if you
 

1659
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,270
is going around me you got it but if you
if you

1660
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,280
if you
 

1661
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,550
if you
um

1662
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560
um
 

1663
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,670
um
dissected that movement

1664
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
dissected that movement
 

1665
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,030
dissected that movement
do you get what i'm saying i'm gonna i'm

1666
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
do you get what i'm saying i'm gonna i'm
 

1667
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,870
do you get what i'm saying i'm gonna i'm
not gonna look anymore at the solid

1668
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
not gonna look anymore at the solid
 

1669
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,510
not gonna look anymore at the solid
curve and the communion okay the

1670
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
curve and the communion okay the
 

1671
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,270
curve and the communion okay the
communion itself is it has within it an

1672
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280
communion itself is it has within it an
 

1673
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,750
communion itself is it has within it an
eye key and you can see it i'm not sorry

1674
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:47,760
eye key and you can see it i'm not sorry
 

1675
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,030
eye key and you can see it i'm not sorry
a coq as you slice the radius up into

1676
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
a coq as you slice the radius up into
 

1677
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,790
a coq as you slice the radius up into
its little micro vectors okay so uh for

1678
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
its little micro vectors okay so uh for
 

1679
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,990
its little micro vectors okay so uh for
example

1680
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
example
 

1681
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,710
example
uh let's move him out of the way

1682
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
uh let's move him out of the way
 

1683
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,870
uh let's move him out of the way
and he's going to check a vector by

1684
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
and he's going to check a vector by
 

1685
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,069
and he's going to check a vector by
pushing into it do you see you get it

1686
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:04,079
pushing into it do you see you get it
 

1687
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,069
pushing into it do you see you get it
and he's going he's pushing and

1688
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:08,079
and he's going he's pushing and
 

1689
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,349
and he's going he's pushing and
is that ikey this is called q do you see

1690
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359
is that ikey this is called q do you see
 

1691
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,069
is that ikey this is called q do you see
so the q is in the i key and that is

1692
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
so the q is in the i key and that is
 

1693
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,150
so the q is in the i key and that is
different for example what you guys

1694
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
different for example what you guys
 

1695
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,589
different for example what you guys
might be doing

1696
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
might be doing
 

1697
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,030
might be doing
is you're doing an external

1698
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
is you're doing an external
 

1699
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,270
is you're doing an external
so it's coming and you're just kind of

1700
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
so it's coming and you're just kind of
 

1701
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,510
so it's coming and you're just kind of
yielding and getting it out of the way

1702
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
yielding and getting it out of the way
 

1703
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,470
yielding and getting it out of the way
you see

1704
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
you see
 

1705
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,589
you see
so he's going and you're going here

1706
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
so he's going and you're going here
 

1707
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,750
so he's going and you're going here
do you see

1708
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,760
do you see
 

1709
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,230
do you see
oh you're just moving out of the way

1710
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
oh you're just moving out of the way
 

1711
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,230
oh you're just moving out of the way
okay so i'm going to do that lazy

1712
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,240
okay so i'm going to do that lazy
 

1713
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,270
okay so i'm going to do that lazy
movement and he's going to cut a vector

1714
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
movement and he's going to cut a vector
 

1715
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,270
movement and he's going to cut a vector
across that radius so

1716
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
across that radius so
 

1717
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,069
across that radius so
i here i was going to move it that way

1718
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
i here i was going to move it that way
 

1719
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,150
i here i was going to move it that way
you see okay now he's going to push on

1720
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
you see okay now he's going to push on
 

1721
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,390
you see okay now he's going to push on
that vector you see it over here and

1722
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
that vector you see it over here and
 

1723
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,990
that vector you see it over here and
it's like no no no it's going to

1724
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
it's like no no no it's going to
 

1725
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,150
it's like no no no it's going to
compromise itself do you get it do you

1726
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
compromise itself do you get it do you
 

1727
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,510
compromise itself do you get it do you
understand okay so within the iq there's

1728
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
understand okay so within the iq there's
 

1729
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,670
understand okay so within the iq there's
here and if i'm touching him within the

1730
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680
here and if i'm touching him within the
 

1731
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,230
here and if i'm touching him within the
call q there's an i key okay so we're

1732
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,240
call q there's an i key okay so we're
 

1733
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,829
call q there's an i key okay so we're
down to the pin which is where your

1734
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
down to the pin which is where your
 

1735
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,589
down to the pin which is where your
question came up

1736
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
question came up
 

1737
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,109
question came up
is the transition from the i key

1738
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
is the transition from the i key
 

1739
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,390
is the transition from the i key
a transition to weight well no because

1740
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
a transition to weight well no because
 

1741
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,390
a transition to weight well no because
this is weight this is weight and that's

1742
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
this is weight this is weight and that's
 

1743
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,950
this is weight this is weight and that's
not what i did and nor is it true that i

1744
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
not what i did and nor is it true that i
 

1745
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,069
not what i did and nor is it true that i
didn't have a heaviness in the on the

1746
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
didn't have a heaviness in the on the
 

1747
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,790
didn't have a heaviness in the on the
elbow control throughout the entire time

1748
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
elbow control throughout the entire time
 

1749
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,349
elbow control throughout the entire time
in that last version because there was

1750
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
in that last version because there was
 

1751
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,990
in that last version because there was
no coq in the ikea that's why there's no

1752
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
no coq in the ikea that's why there's no
 

1753
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,950
no coq in the ikea that's why there's no
sense of positional integrity got it

1754
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
sense of positional integrity got it
 

1755
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,349
sense of positional integrity got it
which he would experience as weight as

1756
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359
which he would experience as weight as
 

1757
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,430
which he would experience as weight as
mass as forced you do you get it like i

1758
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
mass as forced you do you get it like i
 

1759
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,589
mass as forced you do you get it like i
can't push on that damn thing and i keep

1760
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
can't push on that damn thing and i keep
 

1761
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,109
can't push on that damn thing and i keep
going around it nonetheless okay so it's

1762
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
going around it nonetheless okay so it's
 

1763
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,750
going around it nonetheless okay so it's
not so much and again this is just a

1764
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:41,760
not so much and again this is just a
 

1765
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,030
not so much and again this is just a
poem too

1766
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
poem too
 

1767
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,190
poem too
it's not so much

1768
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
it's not so much
 

1769
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,790
it's not so much
that

1770
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:46,800
that
 

1771
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,430
that
i stopped the i key but

1772
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
i stopped the i key but
 

1773
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,790
i stopped the i key but
a singular vector has come up do you get

1774
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
a singular vector has come up do you get
 

1775
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,150
a singular vector has come up do you get
it so

1776
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
it so
 

1777
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,589
it so
all he's looking for is he's cutting the

1778
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
all he's looking for is he's cutting the
 

1779
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,190
all he's looking for is he's cutting the
ikey radius with the linear vector and

1780
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
ikey radius with the linear vector and
 

1781
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,109
ikey radius with the linear vector and
he's just like he did in that last

1782
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
he's just like he did in that last
 

1783
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,990
he's just like he did in that last
demonstration right so he's pushing up

1784
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
demonstration right so he's pushing up
 

1785
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,470
demonstration right so he's pushing up
and he should feel that i can't push in

1786
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
and he should feel that i can't push in
 

1787
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,030
and he should feel that i can't push in
on that okay it's not that i'm pinning

1788
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
on that okay it's not that i'm pinning
 

1789
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,030
on that okay it's not that i'm pinning
his elbow down because i'm not

1790
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
his elbow down because i'm not
 

1791
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,950
his elbow down because i'm not
interested in pinning because this is

1792
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
interested in pinning because this is
 

1793
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,829
interested in pinning because this is
not how you pin somebody in a fight okay

1794
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
not how you pin somebody in a fight okay
 

1795
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,630
not how you pin somebody in a fight okay
i'm just checking myself internally so

1796
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
i'm just checking myself internally so
 

1797
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,309
i'm just checking myself internally so
he's trying to push up

1798
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
he's trying to push up
 

1799
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,950
he's trying to push up
and i have the same thing okay but as

1800
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:24,960
and i have the same thing okay but as
 

1801
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,990
and i have the same thing okay but as
you saw

1802
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
you saw
 

1803
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,390
you saw
as he started to move in the in the

1804
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
as he started to move in the in the
 

1805
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,990
as he started to move in the in the
other demonstration

1806
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
other demonstration
 

1807
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,230
other demonstration
it has the eye key

1808
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
it has the eye key
 

1809
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,710
it has the eye key
to it do you see it's not that

1810
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720
to it do you see it's not that
 

1811
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,670
to it do you see it's not that
i'm sitting here and he pulls it out and

1812
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
i'm sitting here and he pulls it out and
 

1813
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,190
i'm sitting here and he pulls it out and
i'm like

1814
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200
i'm like
 

1815
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,309
i'm like
got it so this is how to understand it

1816
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
got it so this is how to understand it
 

1817
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,309
got it so this is how to understand it
okay

1818
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319

 

1819
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,349

when you do keemon kihon is not gu kimon

1820

when you do keemon kihon is not gu kimon
 

1821
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,710
when you do keemon kihon is not gu kimon
is not play

1822
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
is not play
 

1823
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,670
is not play
right

1824
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
right
 

1825
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,430
right
you can do ki hon

1826
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
you can do ki hon
 

1827
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,990
you can do ki hon
you can do kimon like that

1828
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
you can do kimon like that
 

1829
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,510
you can do kimon like that
as nage

1830
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
as nage
 

1831
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,550
as nage
which means i'm i'm in his center i make

1832
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,560
which means i'm i'm in his center i make
 

1833
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,030
which means i'm i'm in his center i make
sure i'm in his center okay

1834
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,040
sure i'm in his center okay
 

1835
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,109
sure i'm in his center okay
but that's not key one

1836
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119
but that's not key one
 

1837
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,990
but that's not key one
if i'm if i'm the nage and i make sure

1838
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,000
if i'm if i'm the nage and i make sure
 

1839
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,430
if i'm if i'm the nage and i make sure
i'm in his center

1840
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
i'm in his center
 

1841
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,990
i'm in his center
regardless if he's in my center

1842
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
regardless if he's in my center
 

1843
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,470
regardless if he's in my center
that's not keyhon okay

1844
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480
that's not keyhon okay
 

1845
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,910
that's not keyhon okay
kihon is i getting his center from a

1846
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920
kihon is i getting his center from a
 

1847
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,670
kihon is i getting his center from a
young perspective

1848
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
young perspective
 

1849
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,390
young perspective
and he gets in my center from a yin

1850
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
and he gets in my center from a yin
 

1851
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,950
and he gets in my center from a yin
perspective and it leads to an entirely

1852
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
perspective and it leads to an entirely
 

1853
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,309
perspective and it leads to an entirely
different looking enchantment okay

1854
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319

i do have the additional element there
 

1863
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,790
i do have the additional element there
because there is a

he passively address it meaning he's
doing the technique with

1876
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
doing the technique with
 

1877
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,950
doing the technique with
the consciousness of multiple attackers

1878
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
the consciousness of multiple attackers
 

1879
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,190
the consciousness of multiple attackers
i am doing the technique with the

1880
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
i am doing the technique with the
 

1881
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,150
i am doing the technique with the
presence of multiple attackers an

1882
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
presence of multiple attackers an
 

1883
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,630

two different

1886
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
two different
 

1887
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,109
two different
uh energy sources

1888
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119
uh energy sources
 

1889
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,950
uh energy sources
one is him

1890
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
one is him
 

1891
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,510
one is him
and the second one is the mat

1892
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
and the second one is the mat
 

1893
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,550
and the second one is the mat
okay

1894
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
okay
 

1895
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,589
okay
so as i go into the technique i have to

1896
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
so as i go into the technique i have to
 

1897
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,030
so as i go into the technique i have to
not only reconcile his energy yin and

1898
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
not only reconcile his energy yin and
 

1899
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,230
not only reconcile his energy yin and
yang non-contestation i can't cook you

1900
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
yang non-contestation i can't cook you
 

1901
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,190
yang non-contestation i can't cook you
but i have to do the same to the mat do

1902
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
but i have to do the same to the mat do
 

1903
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,670
but i have to do the same to the mat do
you understand so i don't fall to the

1904
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,680
you understand so i don't fall to the
 

1905
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,309
you understand so i don't fall to the
mat in some near last way and that has

1906
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
mat in some near last way and that has
 

1907
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,750
mat in some near last way and that has
to be represented okay so as i go into

1908
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:37,760
to be represented okay so as i go into
 

1909
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,950
to be represented okay so as i go into
this technique i'm in his center as much

1910
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
this technique i'm in his center as much
 

1911
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,390
this technique i'm in his center as much
as he's in mine and he wasn't totally in

1912
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
as he's in mine and he wasn't totally in
 

1913
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,870
as he's in mine and he wasn't totally in
my center and you saw the energy leak

1914
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:46,880
my center and you saw the energy leak
 

1915
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,710
my center and you saw the energy leak
out okay so

1916
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
out okay so
 

1917
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,309
out okay so
there is as i felt that technique you're

1918
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:52,319
there is as i felt that technique you're
 

1919
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,870
there is as i felt that technique you're
not in enough i i don't know if you did

1920
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
not in enough i i don't know if you did
 

1921
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,349
not in enough i i don't know if you did
or not but it felt like your energy was

1922
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359
or not but it felt like your energy was
 

1923
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,309
or not but it felt like your energy was
out here instead of in here we'll watch

1924
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:00,319
out here instead of in here we'll watch
 

1925
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,109
out here instead of in here we'll watch
the video to see what happens so you and

1926
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
the video to see what happens so you and
 

1927
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:21,270
the video to see what happens so you and
there you go now he's in me

1928
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280

 

1929
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:34,470

this is different

1936
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319

 

1937
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,870

1949
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,710

you guys see that

00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720

 

1951
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,030

map but getting down to them that seems
 

1963
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,190
map but getting down to them that seems
so soft

1964
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
so soft
 

1965
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,430
so soft
and

1966
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440

how
 

1971
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,710

what is the
mindset there

mindset there
 

1975
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,349
mindset there
i think um

1976
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359

 

1977
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,190

like i said

1978
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,200
like i said
 

1979
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,589
like i said
it's another

1980
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
it's another
 

1981
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,790
it's another
energy and i don't push on that energy

1982
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
energy and i don't push on that energy
 

1983
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,430
energy and i don't push on that energy
do you got it but

1984
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,440
do you got it but
 

1985
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,670
do you got it but
i can't

1986
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
i can't
 

1987
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,230
i can't
have a weakness

1988
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
have a weakness
 

1989
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,870
have a weakness
on the on any vector

1990
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
on the on any vector
 

1991
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,390
on the on any vector
of the rotation

1992
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
of the rotation
 

1993
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:36,470
of the rotation
do you understand

1994
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480

 

1995
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,750

so when we talk about a curve

1996
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760

 

1997
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,390

and what i'm talking about now

1998
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
and what i'm talking about now
 

1999
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,710
and what i'm talking about now
is the radius and all these various

2000
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
is the radius and all these various
 

2001
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,990
is the radius and all these various
points

2002
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
points
 

2003
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,710
points
are like spokes of a wheel

2004
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
are like spokes of a wheel
 

2005
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,510
are like spokes of a wheel
they will not collapse

2006
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
they will not collapse
 

2007
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,190
they will not collapse
do you get it

2008
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,200
do you get it
 

2009
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,109
do you get it
the energy

2010
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
the energy
 

2011
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,950
the energy
that keeps

2012
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
that keeps
 

2013
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,750
that keeps
the integrity of the radius

2014
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
the integrity of the radius
 

2015
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,950
the integrity of the radius
the curve is dependent upon

2016
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
the curve is dependent upon
 

2017
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,470
the curve is dependent upon
the integrity

2018
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:06,480
the integrity
 

2019
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,990
the integrity
of the linear

2020
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
of the linear
 

2021
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,150
of the linear
energy that creates the possibility of

00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
energy that creates the possibility of
 

2023
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,589

2024
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:15,599
the curve okay so the radii cannot be
 

2025
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,750
the curve okay so the radii cannot be
these soft gooey things

2026

00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
pressure or force
 

2031
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,430
pressure or force
right that you're going to negate

2032
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,440
right that you're going to negate
 

2033
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,109
right that you're going to negate
by trying to say i'm going to go around

2034
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
by trying to say i'm going to go around
 

2035
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,470
by trying to say i'm going to go around
it i'm going to go around it you see

2036
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
it i'm going to go around it you see
 

2037
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,710
it i'm going to go around it you see
um

2038
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
um
 

2039
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,750
um
so when you're coming down

2040
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
so when you're coming down
 

2041
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,510
so when you're coming down
onto the mat

2042
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520

 

2043
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,510

by doing my technique

2044
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
by doing my technique
 

2045
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,750
by doing my technique
i'm not going to go boom

2046
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
i'm not going to go boom
 

2047
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,470
i'm not going to go boom
you see

2048
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480

 

2049
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,430

that is a strong radius but no curve

2050
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440

 

2051
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,510

nor am i going to go

2052
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
nor am i going to go
 

2053
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,510
nor am i going to go
curve

2054
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:55,520
curve
 

2055
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,230
curve
because it's actually not that smooth a

2056
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,240
because it's actually not that smooth a
 

2057
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,109
because it's actually not that smooth a
wheel

2058
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
wheel
 

2059
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,430
wheel
you see you can hear it

2060
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,440
you see you can hear it
 

2061
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,270
you see you can hear it
okay

2062
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,280
okay
 

2063
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,549
okay
so

2064
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:04,559
so
 

2065
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,549
so
i am in him now so i'll show you you see

2066
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:10,559

 

2067
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,589

i mean him as much as he's in me

2068
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
i mean him as much as he's in me
 

2069
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,349
i mean him as much as he's in me
so as we go here right uh i'm in one

2070
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
so as we go here right uh i'm in one
 

2071
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,030
so as we go here right uh i'm in one
foot

2072
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
foot
 

2073
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,069
foot
do you see no different than

2074
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
do you see no different than
 

2075
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,910
do you see no different than
when he was pushing

2076
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:23,920
when he was pushing
 

2077
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,910
when he was pushing
now it's not one foot

2078
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
now it's not one foot
 

2079
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,990
now it's not one foot
we come here

2080
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
we come here
 

2081
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,870
we come here
and go ahead get your base got your base

2082
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
and go ahead get your base got your base
 

2083
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,750
and go ahead get your base got your base
okay and i'm on one foot

2084
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:33,760
okay and i'm on one foot
 

2085
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,630
okay and i'm on one foot
so

2086
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:34,640
so
 

2087
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,430
so
he tries to push

2088
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
he tries to push
 

2089
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,309
he tries to push
push

2090
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:38,319
push
 

2091
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,390
push
it's the ground vector

2092
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
it's the ground vector
 

2093
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,790
it's the ground vector
do you see well i'm in him as much as

2094
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:42,800
do you see well i'm in him as much as
 

2095
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,630
do you see well i'm in him as much as
he's in me

2096
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
he's in me
 

2097
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,589
he's in me
then

2098
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
then
 

2099
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,829
then
he's going

2100
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:46,839
he's going
 

2101
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,790
he's going
to do the ik adhesion around his person

2102
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
to do the ik adhesion around his person
 

2103
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,390
to do the ik adhesion around his person
and all i do

2104
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
and all i do
 

2105
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,829

is blend
 

2107
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,510
is blend
with that energy

2108
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520

 

2109
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,829

blending

2110
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:00,839
blending
 

2111
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,309
blending
means harmonizing yin and yang

2112
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
means harmonizing yin and yang
 

2113
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,790
means harmonizing yin and yang
but harmonizing yin and yang

2114

well as i said though
there's two things i gotta pay attention

2142
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
there's two things i gotta pay attention
 

2143
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,430
there's two things i gotta pay attention
to which is him

2144
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,440
to which is him
 

2145
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,670
to which is him
and eventually the match

2146
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
and eventually the match
 

2147
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,630
and eventually the match
so

2148
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
so
 

2149
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,510
so
when i touch the mat

2150
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
when i touch the mat
 

2151
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,549
when i touch the mat
instead of

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,670
it simultaneously gives rise to
dichotomy to dichotomous thought

2306
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
dichotomy to dichotomous thought
 

2307
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,270

dichotomous living
 

2309
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,069
dichotomous living
right

2310
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
right
 

2311
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,230
right
um which in turn

2312
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
um which in turn
 

2313
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,710
um which in turn
uh you can have them be quiet

2314
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
uh you can have them be quiet
 

2315

um
 

2317
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,510
um
you which in turn starts a

2318
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
you which in turn starts a

um
 

2325
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,829
um
avoidance and attraction you see

2326
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:12,839
avoidance and attraction you see
 

2327
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,390
avoidance and attraction you see
um

2328
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
um
 

2329
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,710
um
it comes to us through the to the

2330
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
it comes to us through the to the
 

2331
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,270
it comes to us through the to the
simultaneously arising what we call the

2332
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
simultaneously arising what we call the
 

2333

three diseases fear pride and ignorance
 

2335
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,990
three diseases fear pride and ignorance
so if you look at um

2336
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
so if you look at um
 

2337
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,270
so if you look at um
most of aikido

2338
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
most of aikido
 

2339
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,990
most of aikido
that today that's what you see so why do

2340
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
that today that's what you see so why do
 

2341
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,309
that today that's what you see so why do
you block the arm why do you stop the

2342
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
you block the arm why do you stop the
 

2343
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,910
you block the arm why do you stop the
arm why do you take away the conflict

2344
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
arm why do you take away the conflict
 

2345
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,790
arm why do you take away the conflict
because you cannot reconcile it do you

2346
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
because you cannot reconcile it do you
 

2347
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,430
because you cannot reconcile it do you
see because you have dichotomous so

2348
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440

 

2349
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,349

artificially

2350
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
artificially

2353
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,349
taking away
the dichotomy such as ukid does not

the dichotomy such as ukid does not
 

2355
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,349
the dichotomy such as ukid does not
actually attack with shomuchi i am

all they kind of just stick their arm
 

2363
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,910
all they kind of just stick their arm
out there this is an artificial removal

2364
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
out there this is an artificial removal
 

2365
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,150
out there this is an artificial removal
of the dichotomy

2366
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
of the dichotomy
 

2367
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,309
of the dichotomy
the reason you have to do that is

2368
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:06,319
the reason you have to do that is
 

2369
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,829
the reason you have to do that is
because you cannot reconcile the

2370
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
because you cannot reconcile the
