1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,270

some basic beginner details on this okay

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
some basic beginner details on this okay
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,470
some basic beginner details on this okay
so he has to see he has to see at a

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
so he has to see he has to see at a
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,710
so he has to see he has to see at a
range where he would actually do it

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
range where he would actually do it
 

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,350
range where he would actually do it
so uh where he'd actually do damage okay

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
so uh where he'd actually do damage okay
 

9
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,070
so uh where he'd actually do damage okay
so

10
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
so
 

11
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,070
so
kissing the surface of me is going to

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
kissing the surface of me is going to
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,150
kissing the surface of me is going to
change the my of the form that will

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
change the my of the form that will
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,990
change the my of the form that will
change the logic of the form it will

16
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
change the logic of the form it will
 

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,990
change the logic of the form it will
eventually be illogical

18
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
eventually be illogical
 

19
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,310
eventually be illogical
okay but i can't start here either so

20
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
okay but i can't start here either so
 

21
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,349
okay but i can't start here either so
that he gets ski

22
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
that he gets ski
 

23
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,830
that he gets ski
because that's the wrong my for starting

24
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
because that's the wrong my for starting
 

25
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,950
because that's the wrong my for starting
too

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
too
 

27
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,870
too
so you have to figure out where you need

28
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
so you have to figure out where you need
 

29
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,030
so you have to figure out where you need
to be uh

30
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
to be uh
 

31
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,750
to be uh
and how he needs to ski so he's gonna do

32
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
and how he needs to ski so he's gonna do
 

33
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,870
and how he needs to ski so he's gonna do
his thing

34
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
his thing
 

35
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,229
his thing
and he has to get through the target

36
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
and he has to get through the target
 

37
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,270
and he has to get through the target
okay

38
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
okay
 

39
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,910
okay
sometimes your beginner partner is way

40
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
sometimes your beginner partner is way

out there
 

43
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,869
out there
and they ski and they're nowhere near

44
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
and they ski and they're nowhere near
 

45
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,830
and they ski and they're nowhere near
doing it okay or sometimes they start

46
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
doing it okay or sometimes they start
 

47
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,229
doing it okay or sometimes they start
close

48
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
close
 

49
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,709
close
because their footwork sucks and you

50
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
because their footwork sucks and you
 

51
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,549

that would be the wrong my two
 

53
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,830
that would be the wrong my two
okay so you just uh to learn it correct

okay second point

110
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120

 

111
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,830

this is going to already be in prep for

112
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
this is going to already be in prep for
 

113
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,990
this is going to already be in prep for
my other hand to go on

114
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
my other hand to go on
 

115
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,190
my other hand to go on
don't transfer hands in the middle

116
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
don't transfer hands in the middle
 

117
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,910
don't transfer hands in the middle
of moving it like this you won't have

118
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
of moving it like this you won't have
 

119
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,509
of moving it like this you won't have
the power hand

120
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
the power hand
 

121
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,190
the power hand
so it's not needed for the block here

122
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
so it's not needed for the block here
 

123
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,790
so it's not needed for the block here
then the power head can go on and you

124
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
then the power head can go on and you
 

125
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,470
then the power head can go on and you
get a full stroke

126
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
get a full stroke
 

127
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,589
get a full stroke
what would be different is your hair

128
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
what would be different is your hair
 

129
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,589

you'll catch it somewhere around here

132
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
you'll catch it somewhere around here
 

133
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,949
you'll catch it somewhere around here
that's not much of a power hand stroke

134
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
that's not much of a power hand stroke
 

135
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,830
that's not much of a power hand stroke
so set it up once

136
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840

 

137
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,509

hit when you hit you're going to turn

138
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519

aikido's overall
 

345
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,829
aikido's overall
pattern is spiral and this is not a

346
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
pattern is spiral and this is not a
 

347
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,310
pattern is spiral and this is not a
spiral

348
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
spiral
 

349
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,590
spiral
so the fight overall is going to rotate

350
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
so the fight overall is going to rotate
 

351
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,750
so the fight overall is going to rotate
so as i go in the fight is rotating

352
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
so as i go in the fight is rotating
 

353
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,030
so as i go in the fight is rotating
we're starting to spin okay

354
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
we're starting to spin okay
 

355
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,710
we're starting to spin okay
so i want that overall spin and i don't

356
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
so i want that overall spin and i don't
 

357
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,870
so i want that overall spin and i don't
want to have to stop by motion or

358
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
want to have to stop by motion or
 

359
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,790
want to have to stop by motion or
half-past my penetration

360
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
half-past my penetration
 

361
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,430
half-past my penetration
so when i go in i can move here

362
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
so when i go in i can move here
 

363
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,910
so when i go in i can move here
and it'll be very hard athletically to

364
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
and it'll be very hard athletically to
 

365
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,790
and it'll be very hard athletically to
fully commit

366
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
fully commit
 

367
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,230
fully commit
and then come back up

368
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240

 

369
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,670

i also don't want to have a yin opening

370
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
i also don't want to have a yin opening
 

371
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,710
i also don't want to have a yin opening
so i'm not going

372
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720

 

373
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,190

yet even if i could do it i don't want

374
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
yet even if i could do it i don't want
 

375
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,710
yet even if i could do it i don't want
to do it i don't want to lose the

376
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
to do it i don't want to lose the
 

377
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,750
to do it i don't want to lose the
initiative

378
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
initiative
 

379
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,990
initiative
which is why you use the spiraling

380
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
which is why you use the spiraling
 

381
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,590
which is why you use the spiraling
pattern okay

382
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
pattern okay
 

383
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,230
pattern okay
so as i go i'm going this way

384
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
so as i go i'm going this way
 

385
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,910
so as i go i'm going this way
okay this way then i'm in range

386
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
okay this way then i'm in range
 

387
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,949
okay this way then i'm in range
for everything i need to do

388
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959

 

389
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,470

now too close

390
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480

 

391
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,350

too close happens when you're moving

392
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
too close happens when you're moving
 

393
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,509
too close happens when you're moving
across the radius

394
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
across the radius
 

395
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,470
across the radius
instead of around the radius so instead

396
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
instead of around the radius so instead
 

397
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,069
instead of around the radius so instead
of moving

398
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
of moving
 

399
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,750
of moving
around the technique you cut through the

400
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
around the technique you cut through the
 

401
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,269
around the technique you cut through the
middle

402
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
middle
 

403
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,790
middle
you see that you're going to get too

404
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
you see that you're going to get too
 

405
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,590
you see that you're going to get too
close and then he's going to grapple

406
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600

 

407
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,030

so here

408
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
so here
 

409
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,310
so here
move up the radius of the radius

410
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320

 

411
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,230

don't cut across the radius

412
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
don't cut across the radius
 

413
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,470
don't cut across the radius
okay now let's try to get orientation

414
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
okay now let's try to get orientation
 

415
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,150
okay now let's try to get orientation
uh so when i go i don't wanna

416
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
uh so when i go i don't wanna
 

417
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,389
uh so when i go i don't wanna
this isn't where the fight is the

418
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
this isn't where the fight is the
 

419
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,150
this isn't where the fight is the
fight's over here

420
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
fight's over here
 

421
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,910
fight's over here
so foot's pointing at him okay and

422
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
so foot's pointing at him okay and
 

423
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,470
so foot's pointing at him okay and
you're going to do the technique

424
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
you're going to do the technique
 

425
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,750
you're going to do the technique
embryonically

426
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
embryonically
 

427
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,990
embryonically
so this is not my cancer it's just

428
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
so this is not my cancer it's just
 

429
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,590
so this is not my cancer it's just
drilling

430
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
drilling
 

431
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,269
drilling
uh don't move his weapon

432
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279

 

433
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,509

you go around his weapon straight down

434
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
you go around his weapon straight down
 

435
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,949
you go around his weapon straight down
boom

436
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959

 

437
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,389

so no here

438
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
so no here
 

439
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:42,870
so no here
then don't move his weapon straight down

440
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
then don't move his weapon straight down
 

441
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,030
then don't move his weapon straight down
ski right here

442
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
ski right here
 

443
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,829
ski right here
oriented this way your sunshine

444
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
oriented this way your sunshine
 

445
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,509
oriented this way your sunshine
everything is this way

446
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
everything is this way
 

447
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,269
everything is this way
and your feet are under your hips

448
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
and your feet are under your hips
 

449
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,550
and your feet are under your hips
just like in on me okay

450
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560

 

451
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,030

if you don't have that and you go like

452
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
if you don't have that and you go like
 

453
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,310
if you don't have that and you go like
this

454
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
this
 

455
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,790
this
you see it's usually because you cut

456
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
you see it's usually because you cut
 

457
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,389
you see it's usually because you cut
across the radius

458
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
across the radius
 

459
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,310
across the radius
you violated the mind you'd be in

460
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
you violated the mind you'd be in
 

461
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,069
you violated the mind you'd be in
grappling or

462
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
grappling or
 

463
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,110
grappling or
sidekick i would

464
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
sidekick i would
 

465
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,389
sidekick i would
use the front foot but okay all right so

466
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
use the front foot but okay all right so
 

467
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,590
use the front foot but okay all right so
uh boom feet

468
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
uh boom feet
 

469
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,910
uh boom feet
under you there's also something else to

470
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
under you there's also something else to
 

471
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,870
under you there's also something else to
consider

472
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
consider
 

473
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,389
consider
the deeper your stance is here not only

474
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
the deeper your stance is here not only
 

475
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,750
the deeper your stance is here not only
are you closer now to

476
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
are you closer now to
 

477
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,550
are you closer now to
his body weapons but your ski

478
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
his body weapons but your ski
 

479
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,389
his body weapons but your ski
penetration is decreased

480
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
penetration is decreased
 

481
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,509
penetration is decreased
okay because you're already

482
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
okay because you're already
 

483
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,310
okay because you're already
shot your thrust and you want your foot

484
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
shot your thrust and you want your foot
 

485
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,269
shot your thrust and you want your foot
back here

486
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
back here
 

487
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,870
back here
and then you can move much further

488
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880

 

489
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,150

so boom here don't move his weapon

490
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
so boom here don't move his weapon
 

491
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,949
so boom here don't move his weapon
go around his weapon here oriented

492
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
go around his weapon here oriented
 

493
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,150
go around his weapon here oriented
forward

494
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160

 

495
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,990

okay let's go okay because

496
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
okay let's go okay because
 

497
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,430
okay let's go okay because
in essence i double penetrated okay so

498
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
in essence i double penetrated okay so
 

499
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,829
in essence i double penetrated okay so
i'm going and i came forward again

500
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
i'm going and i came forward again
 

501
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,030
i'm going and i came forward again
right and then forward again the fight

502
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
right and then forward again the fight
 

503
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,990
right and then forward again the fight
got close

504
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
got close
 

505
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,629
got close
you see and that that's what you want is

506
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
you see and that that's what you want is
 

507
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,190
you see and that that's what you want is
that

508
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
that
 

509
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,750
that
not only do i have a rotating geometry

510
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
not only do i have a rotating geometry
 

511
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,110
not only do i have a rotating geometry
but i have a pulsing geometry

512
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
but i have a pulsing geometry
 

513
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,389
but i have a pulsing geometry
okay uh so the fight's going to get in

514
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
okay uh so the fight's going to get in
 

515
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,790
okay uh so the fight's going to get in
