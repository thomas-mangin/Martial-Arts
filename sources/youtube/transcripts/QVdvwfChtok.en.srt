of the two minds that that would be
 

193
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,050
of the two minds that that would be
crazy no one would ever conceive of that

but when you look at

but when you look at
 

237
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,270
but when you look at
it is that ritual

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
it is that ritual
 

239
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,390
it is that ritual
not a self-defense or a sparring

240
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
not a self-defense or a sparring

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,770
not a self-defense or a sparring
environment

environment
 

243
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,590

you have to pull that out

244
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600

 

245
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,350

so in that sense

246
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
so in that sense
 

247
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,370
so in that sense
you're not necessarily working on here's

248
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
you're not necessarily working on here's
 

249
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,370
you're not necessarily working on here's
what you do when somebody uh tries to

250
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,380
what you do when somebody uh tries to
 

251
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,290
what you do when somebody uh tries to
cut your head

252
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,300
cut your head
 

253
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,450
cut your head
and then you start arguing over who

254
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,460
and then you start arguing over who
 

255
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,610
and then you start arguing over who
would cut your head like that

256
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
would cut your head like that
 

257
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,550
would cut your head like that
do you understand

258
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560

 

259
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,050

the beginning point is totally arbitrary

260
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
the beginning point is totally arbitrary
 

261
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,350
the beginning point is totally arbitrary
because the sole goal is

262
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
because the sole goal is
 

263
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,570
because the sole goal is
this integration

264
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:20,580
this integration
 

265
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,710
this integration
of the goeth mind and the god mind

266
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
of the goeth mind and the god mind
 

267
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,129
of the goeth mind and the god mind
that's what you're after

268
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:28,139

 

269
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,950

so

270
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960

 

271
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,770

what Aikido has done over the course of

272
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
what Aikido has done over the course of
 

273
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,589
what Aikido has done over the course of
very relatively short time

274
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
very relatively short time
 

275
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,710
very relatively short time
is that has been lost why because

276
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
is that has been lost why because
 

277
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,089
is that has been lost why because
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the

278
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:44,099
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the
 

279
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,230
culturally oh Sensei was at the end the
tail end of an age

280
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240

 

281
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,350

where secular materialism and the

282
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
where secular materialism and the
 

283
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,230
where secular materialism and the
scientific epistemy established its

284
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
scientific epistemy established its
 

285
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,490
scientific epistemy established its
economic dominance

286
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500

 

287
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,249

and the resultant of that is that the

288
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:01,259
and the resultant of that is that the
 

289
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,809
and the resultant of that is that the
art is understood materialistically

290
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,819

 

291
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,290

not metaphysically

292
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,300

 

293
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,110

and that's how you you get into the

294
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,120
and that's how you you get into the
 

295
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,809
and that's how you you get into the
little debate that is going on in the

296
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:14,819
little debate that is going on in the
 

297
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,510
little debate that is going on in the
Aikido world oh Aikido needs to be

298
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
Aikido world oh Aikido needs to be
 

299
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,230
Aikido world oh Aikido needs to be
martial Aikido is nothing about fighting

300
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
martial Aikido is nothing about fighting
 

301
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,029
martial Aikido is nothing about fighting
and you can see

302
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
and you can see
 

303
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,450
and you can see
do you get that

304
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,460

 

305
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,670

but no one can do what the founder did

306
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680

 

307
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,709

so yesterday I did a video with you and

308
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
so yesterday I did a video with you and
 

309
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,810
so yesterday I did a video with you and
you are working

310
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:38,820
you are working
 

311
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,829
you are working
uh on something that the general Aikido

312
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
uh on something that the general Aikido
 

313
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,670
uh on something that the general Aikido
rule does not understand what

314
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:46,680

 

315
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,050

so

316
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,060
so
 

317
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,990
so
why don't they understand what and how

318
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
why don't they understand what and how
 

319
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,110
why don't they understand what and how
would you understand better what Kehoe

320
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
would you understand better what Kehoe
 

321
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,290
would you understand better what Kehoe

326
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580
these were ritualistic manifestations
 

327
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,370
these were ritualistic manifestations
of the doubt of Yin and Yang

would understand that as the momentum
 

521
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,069
would understand that as the momentum
and the inertia increases there would be

522
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
and the inertia increases there would be
 

523
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,150
and the inertia increases there would be
more uh resistance to radical changes in

speed down
 

531
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,009
speed down
and forward it would be harder for her

532
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:25,019
and forward it would be harder for her
 

533
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,610
and forward it would be harder for her
to change to go rearward or to turn this

the way there's no effort in it at all
 

633
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,810
the way there's no effort in it at all
in the middle

pull do you understand
okay go

656
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:30,540

 

657
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,650

so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm

658
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:33,660
so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm
 

659
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,250
so what am I doing I'm grounding I'm
grounding over here so I'm not holding

660
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,260
grounding over here so I'm not holding
 

661
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,610
grounding over here so I'm not holding
here like this again this is the

662
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:40,620
here like this again this is the
 

663
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,570
here like this again this is the
internal stuff you cannot see

664
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:44,580

 

665
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,270

this is supposed to be impossible right

666
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
this is supposed to be impossible right
 

667
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,850
this is supposed to be impossible right
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm

668
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:49,860
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm
 

669
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,890
in other words if she pulls the arm I'm
supposed to go like this

670
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:51,900
supposed to go like this
 

671
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,990
supposed to go like this
but here I'm just gonna grab

672
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,000

 

673
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,730

you see

674
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:01,740

 

675
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,810

that's it

676
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:02,820
that's it
 

677
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,029
that's it
then

678
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
then
 

679
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,930
then
again all impossible

680
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:08,940

 

681
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,330

because there's no internal skills that

682
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,340
because there's no internal skills that
 

683
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,010
because there's no internal skills that
are visible

684
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,020
are visible
 

685
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,070
are visible
there's no

686
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,080
there's no
 

687
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,510
there's no
experience in the internal

688
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
experience in the internal
 

689
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,250
experience in the internal
so yesterday when your knees were

690
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,260
so yesterday when your knees were
 

691
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,890
so yesterday when your knees were
hurting that would be not internal

692
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:24,900

 

693
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,770

so again at full speed that would be

694
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:27,780
so again at full speed that would be
 

695
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,390
so again at full speed that would be
very hard because she's supposed to cut

696
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
very hard because she's supposed to cut
 

697
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,450
very hard because she's supposed to cut
down remember but it's not like your

698
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,460
down remember but it's not like your
 

699
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,010
down remember but it's not like your
arm's gonna go there

700
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,020
arm's gonna go there
 

701
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,210
arm's gonna go there
because there's an internal movement

702
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,220
because there's an internal movement
 

703
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,250
because there's an internal movement
that is happening

704
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,260
that is happening
 

705
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,430
that is happening
that's inside the centrifugal energy

706
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
that's inside the centrifugal energy
 

707
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,010
that's inside the centrifugal energy
that everyone knows and sees do you see

708
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,020
that everyone knows and sees do you see
 

709
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,510
that everyone knows and sees do you see
that and as in your body

710
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
that and as in your body
 

711
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,029
that and as in your body
there is enough resistance in the

712
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
there is enough resistance in the
 

713
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,310
there is enough resistance in the
movement of your mass

714
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,320
movement of your mass
 

715
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,130
movement of your mass
that that's what's actually making you

716
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,140
that that's what's actually making you
 

717
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,330
that that's what's actually making you
come around

718
00:18:59,330 --> 00:18:59,340
come around
 

719
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,770
come around
okay so for example uh don't add any

720
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:03,780
okay so for example uh don't add any
 

721
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,990
okay so for example uh don't add any
energy I'll bring you around

722
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,000

 

723
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,150

add the energy that way

724
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

 

725
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,150

because her energy is generating more

726
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,160
because her energy is generating more
 

727
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,190
because her energy is generating more
Force at the point of contact

728
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
Force at the point of contact
 

729
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,430
Force at the point of contact
so I do that with your mass

730
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,440
so I do that with your mass
 

731
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,529
so I do that with your mass
here's your mask I'm going to move your

732
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:24,539
here's your mask I'm going to move your
 

733
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,010
here's your mask I'm going to move your
mass I ground your mass

734
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,020
mass I ground your mass
 

735
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,930
mass I ground your mass
and it brings the body around

736
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:29,940
and it brings the body around
 

737
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,909
and it brings the body around
but not by me

738
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
but not by me
 

739
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,490
but not by me
doing a mad amount of strength on your

740
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:34,500
doing a mad amount of strength on your
 

741
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,250
doing a mad amount of strength on your
joint

742
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,260

 

743
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,850

back

744
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:40,860

 

745
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,049

so if we go slow again

746
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:45,059
so if we go slow again
 

747
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,990
so if we go slow again
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't

748
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't
 

749
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,930
she has to finish the cut but it doesn't
matter you can pull you can pull it's

750
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
matter you can pull you can pull it's
 

751
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,789
matter you can pull you can pull it's
still going to come around this way as I

752
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
still going to come around this way as I
 

753
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,850
still going to come around this way as I
ground

754
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860

 

755
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,590

okay now actually in Nico

756
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
okay now actually in Nico
 

757
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,289
okay now actually in Nico
she resists that's what she's supposed

758
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:03,299
she resists that's what she's supposed
 

759
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,830
she resists that's what she's supposed
to do in the keyhon per prescription she

760
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:06,840
to do in the keyhon per prescription she
 

761
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,590
to do in the keyhon per prescription she
resists

762
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600

 

763
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,310

um

764
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
um
 

765
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,190
um
I could use those same skills

766
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
I could use those same skills
 

767
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,870
I could use those same skills
do you see

768
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
do you see
 

769
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,169
do you see
uh I'll just focus on this hat

770
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
uh I'll just focus on this hat
 

771
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,049
uh I'll just focus on this hat
okay so imagine I have this I have this

772
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:21,059
okay so imagine I have this I have this
 

773
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,529
okay so imagine I have this I have this
joint lock to keep her hand from posting

774
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:24,539
joint lock to keep her hand from posting
 

775
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,190
joint lock to keep her hand from posting
okay I'll take off the joint lock

776
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,200
okay I'll take off the joint lock
 

777
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,810
okay I'll take off the joint lock
and again

778
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:29,820
and again
 

779
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,270
and again
as she tries to stand up

780
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,280
as she tries to stand up
 

781
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,549
as she tries to stand up
that's internalized and you see all it

782
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
that's internalized and you see all it
 

783
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,070
that's internalized and you see all it
does is make her go off balance so you

784
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
does is make her go off balance so you
 

785
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,630
does is make her go off balance so you
want to try to get up

786
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
want to try to get up
 

787
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,570
want to try to get up
get up all the way

788
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,580
get up all the way
 

789
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:49,789
get up all the way
go

790
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:49,799

 

791
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,830

okay so what I do in the technique

792
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
okay so what I do in the technique
 

793
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,130
okay so what I do in the technique
though is when I feel her resistance to

794
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,140
though is when I feel her resistance to
 

795
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,850
though is when I feel her resistance to
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down

796
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:58,860
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down
 

797
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,090
the Eco Ura instead of shoving it down
I go one more Tank on

798
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,100
I go one more Tank on
 

799
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,750
I go one more Tank on
and this Push Pull again so if you if

800
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
and this Push Pull again so if you if
 

801
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,570
and this Push Pull again so if you if
the push pull let's do that so she's

802
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:08,580
the push pull let's do that so she's
 

803
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,830
the push pull let's do that so she's
here

804
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
here
 

805
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,230
here
it's the same thing here's an internal

806
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
it's the same thing here's an internal
 

807
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,390
it's the same thing here's an internal
pulling like you had on the first one

808
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
pulling like you had on the first one
 

809
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,330
pulling like you had on the first one
and uh internal

810
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,340
and uh internal
 

811
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:27,650
and uh internal
pushing so you're gonna push your hand

812
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:27,660

 

813
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,930

same thing

814
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:29,940
same thing
 

815
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,930
same thing
it just moves the center okay it's not

816
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:32,940
it just moves the center okay it's not
 

817
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,930
it just moves the center okay it's not
here in the joint it's in the body

818
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:35,940
here in the joint it's in the body
 

819
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,669
here in the joint it's in the body
but what I'm going to do instead is

820
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
but what I'm going to do instead is
 

821
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,350
but what I'm going to do instead is
leave it there

822
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
leave it there
 

823
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,870
leave it there
and come around to here

824
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
and come around to here
 

825
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,909
and come around to here
that's it

826
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
that's it
 

827
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,330
that's it
then I attack with rokio

828
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,340
then I attack with rokio
 

829
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,250
then I attack with rokio
but she's gonna counter another

830
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,260
but she's gonna counter another
 

831
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,909
but she's gonna counter another
prescription in Nico so stay there if

832
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
prescription in Nico so stay there if
 

833
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,250
prescription in Nico so stay there if
she doesn't counter a hover

834
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,260
she doesn't counter a hover
 

835
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,730
she doesn't counter a hover
broke you

836
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:58,740

 

837
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,310

she's going to counter rokio

838
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,320
she's going to counter rokio
 

839
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,770
she's going to counter rokio
by dipping her elbow under

840
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:03,780
by dipping her elbow under
 

841
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,310
by dipping her elbow under
and that walks her into Nico again go

842
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,320
and that walks her into Nico again go
 

843
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,169
and that walks her into Nico again go
back

844
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,179
back
 

845
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,770
back
just like I don't she posts there I

846
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:12,780
just like I don't she posts there I
 

847
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,130
just like I don't she posts there I
would not want to do the ritual like

848
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,140
would not want to do the ritual like
 

849
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,070
would not want to do the ritual like
this

850
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080

 

851
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,830

instead as she posts there trying to

852
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
instead as she posts there trying to
 

853
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,570
instead as she posts there trying to
shove her down with the Gilbert I come

around
instead of trying to shove her down with

858
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,340
instead of trying to shove her down with
 

859
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,430
instead of trying to shove her down with
rokio as she comes around and counters I

860
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
rokio as she comes around and counters I
 

861
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,870

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:53,820
relax and extended got it got it feel my
 

1035
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,909
relax and extended got it got it feel my
Center

1036
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919
Center
 

1037
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,490
Center
there's no that's I would never do that

1038
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:58,500
there's no that's I would never do that
 

1039
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,649
there's no that's I would never do that
I might try once and then go no that's

1040
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:00,659
I might try once and then go no that's
 

1041
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,549
I might try once and then go no that's
not gonna work you stronger than me

1042
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559

 

1043
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,430

instead I go around the contention point

1044
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
instead I go around the contention point
 

1045
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,710
instead I go around the contention point
the neutral point it's over here you see

1046
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:11,720
the neutral point it's over here you see
 

1047
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,169
the neutral point it's over here you see
and then the elbow is available there's

1048
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:15,179
and then the elbow is available there's
 

1049
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,549
and then the elbow is available there's
no support

1050
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
no support
 

1051
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,169
no support
do you see

1052
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:18,179
do you see
 

1053
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,330
do you see
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle

1054
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:20,340
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle
 

1055
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,250
and I'm going to make a smaller Circle
so that arm helps me okay so if I do eat

1056
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,260
so that arm helps me okay so if I do eat
 

1057
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,870
so that arm helps me okay so if I do eat
Kyoto again

1058
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
Kyoto again
 

1059
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,590
Kyoto again
it won't we'll do all that again but my

1060
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,600
it won't we'll do all that again but my
 

1061
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,289
it won't we'll do all that again but my
smaller circle is going to go this way

1062
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:36,299

 

1063
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,029

and again

1064
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:38,039
and again
 

1065
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,850
and again
uh you land

1066
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:40,860
uh you land
 

1067
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,029
uh you land
in the technique do you see that yeah

1068
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:44,039
in the technique do you see that yeah
 

1069
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,470
in the technique do you see that yeah
it's not here

1070
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,480
it's not here
 

1071
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,409
it's not here
and then I go here so let's go back

1072
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:51,419

 

1073
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,549

your counter here right we're back here

1074
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:55,559
your counter here right we're back here
 

1075
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,529
your counter here right we're back here
your counter here

1076
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:57,539
your counter here
 

1077
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,930
your counter here
allows me to go around it

1078
00:27:59,930 --> 00:27:59,940
allows me to go around it
 

1079
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,289
allows me to go around it
and we're going to do the same thing

1080
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:03,299
and we're going to do the same thing
 

1081
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,850
and we're going to do the same thing
okay so we'll do uh

1082
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:07,860
okay so we'll do uh
 

1083
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,669
okay so we'll do uh
pull your arm out

1084
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679

 

1085
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,750

okay take that energy pull your arm out

1086
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:20,760

 

1087
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,450

and then what do you do what do you

1088
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,460
and then what do you do what do you
 

1089
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,029
and then what do you do what do you
notice now about the final pin it's

1090
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:26,039
notice now about the final pin it's
 

1091
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,029
notice now about the final pin it's
tighter it's tighter okay it all got

1092
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
tighter it's tighter okay it all got
 

1093
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,350
tighter it's tighter okay it all got
tighter so you land immediately in the

1094
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
tighter so you land immediately in the
 

1095
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,570
tighter so you land immediately in the
dislocation

1096
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:35,580
dislocation
 

1097
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,149
dislocation
okay

1098
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:41,159

 

1099
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,830

to beat

1100
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
to beat
 

1101
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,289
to beat
and

1102
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:44,299
and
 

1103
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,450
and
co-participate in

1104
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:47,460
co-participate in
 

1105
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,510
co-participate in
this egoic God mind integration

1106
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:52,520
this egoic God mind integration
 

1107
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,490
this egoic God mind integration
concentrically is

1108
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,500
concentrically is
 

1109
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,169
concentrically is
that pressurized hata

1110
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:00,179
that pressurized hata
 

1111
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,769
that pressurized hata
is conjoined with my pressurized heart

1112
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:03,779
is conjoined with my pressurized heart
 

1113
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,090
is conjoined with my pressurized heart
okay and what you notice is

1114
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,100
okay and what you notice is
 

1115
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,390
okay and what you notice is
while I can't go anywhere

1116
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,400
while I can't go anywhere
 

1117
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,029
while I can't go anywhere
the technique does not hurt

1118
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:14,039
the technique does not hurt
 

1119
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,049
the technique does not hurt
okay so imagine for any number of

1120
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:18,059
okay so imagine for any number of
 

1121
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,370
okay so imagine for any number of
reasons

1122
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,380
reasons
 

1123
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,610
reasons
you tried to go up or out or in you see

1124
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,620
you tried to go up or out or in you see
 

1125
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,370
you tried to go up or out or in you see
that it just hurts right

1126
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,380
that it just hurts right
 

1127
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,269
that it just hurts right
um and you're gonna go anyways okay

1128
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
um and you're gonna go anyways okay
 

1129
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,610
um and you're gonna go anyways okay
here's the thing

1130
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:31,620
here's the thing
 

1131
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,169
here's the thing
when

1132
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:33,179
when
 

1133
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,010
when
the egoic mind and the god mind are not

1134
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,020
the egoic mind and the god mind are not
 

1135
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,529
the egoic mind and the god mind are not
integrated the center is not Unified

1136
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:42,539
integrated the center is not Unified
 

1137
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:47,870
integrated the center is not Unified
my own nor mine to yours okay and that

1138
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:47,880
my own nor mine to yours okay and that
 

1139
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,669
my own nor mine to yours okay and that
will always lead

1140
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
will always lead
 

1141
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,130
will always lead
to all those things

1142
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,140
to all those things
 

1143
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,169
to all those things
uh that generate pain or crashing on

1144
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:57,179
uh that generate pain or crashing on
 

1145
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,549
uh that generate pain or crashing on
your end

1146
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
your end
 

1147
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,909
your end
you're still gonna go excuse me but how

1148
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
you're still gonna go excuse me but how
 

1149
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,110
you're still gonna go excuse me but how
you experience the nagawaza as ooket is

1150
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,120
you experience the nagawaza as ooket is
 

1151
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,590
you experience the nagawaza as ooket is
entirely different as different as a

human being who experiences work

1154
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:12,899
human being who experiences work
 

1155
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,610
human being who experiences work
solely from the egoic mind that's one

1156
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:16,620
solely from the egoic mind that's one
 

1157
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,990
solely from the egoic mind that's one
day at work

1158
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
day at work
 

1159
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,049
day at work
and another person in the same job doing

1160
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:21,059
and another person in the same job doing
 

1161
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,409
and another person in the same job doing
the same exact thing can integrate the

1162
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
the same exact thing can integrate the
 

1163
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,810
the same exact thing can integrate the
god mind and the egoic mind they have an

1164
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:26,820
god mind and the egoic mind they have an
 

1165
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,029
god mind and the egoic mind they have an
entirely different experience at work

1166
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
entirely different experience at work
 

1167
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,269
entirely different experience at work
okay so when we go what I am feeling for

1168
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:34,279
okay so when we go what I am feeling for
 

1169
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,049
okay so when we go what I am feeling for
and in yesterday's class is

1170
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:39,059
and in yesterday's class is
 

1171
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,149
and in yesterday's class is
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel

1172
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel
 

1173
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,049
that egoic mind okay what how can I feel
it I feel your Center separating from

1174
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:48,059
it I feel your Center separating from
 

1175
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,810
it I feel your Center separating from
mine do you see that oh I feel

1176
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:53,820

 

1177
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,510

that the center to Center connection is

1178
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
that the center to Center connection is
 

1179
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,190
that the center to Center connection is
one way my way to you okay so uh for

1180
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
one way my way to you okay so uh for
 

1181
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,810
one way my way to you okay so uh for
example we're back on yesterday's

1182
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:02,820
example we're back on yesterday's
 

1183
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,350
example we're back on yesterday's
training okay and there was a time

1184
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,360
training okay and there was a time
 

1185
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,430
training okay and there was a time
when you came in this way do you see

1186
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,440
when you came in this way do you see
 

1187
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,870
when you came in this way do you see
that that is a disconnect from the arm

1188
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
that that is a disconnect from the arm
 

1189
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,409
that that is a disconnect from the arm
so I told you you would not be able to

1190
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:18,419
so I told you you would not be able to
 

1191
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,350
so I told you you would not be able to
come that way because the arm cutting

1192
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
come that way because the arm cutting
 

1193
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,330
come that way because the arm cutting
down

1194
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,340
down
 

1195
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,630
down
Center never gets near me okay

1196
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
Center never gets near me okay
 

1197
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,590
Center never gets near me okay
so you fell out of the ritual right so

1198
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:30,600
so you fell out of the ritual right so
 

1199
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,389
so you fell out of the ritual right so

you can intend all you want those are
 

1363
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,310
you can intend all you want those are
all intellectual processes they are all

1364
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:49,320
all intellectual processes they are all
 

1365
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,589
all intellectual processes they are all
part of the egoic mine and they will

1366
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
part of the egoic mine and they will
 

1367
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,530
part of the egoic mine and they will
keep you your ego with mind functioning

1368
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:54,540
keep you your ego with mind functioning
 

1369
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,470
keep you your ego with mind functioning
and they will not be able thereby to

1370
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:57,480
and they will not be able thereby to
 

1371
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,589
and they will not be able thereby to
manifest the god mind and therefore you

1372
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:00,599
manifest the god mind and therefore you
 

1373
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,290
manifest the god mind and therefore you
do not have the original communion and

do not have the original communion and
so you do not have the subsequent

1376
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
so you do not have the subsequent
 

1377
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,210
so you do not have the subsequent
concentric communions do you understand

1378
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:08,220
concentric communions do you understand
 

1379

we're here and I came around and you put
 

1463
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,370
we're here and I came around and you put
your hand in the technique do you see

1464
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:19,380
your hand in the technique do you see
 

1465
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,870
your hand in the technique do you see
that

1466
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
that
 

1467
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,089
that
um why

1468
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:25,099

 

1469
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:29,990

no no it's an egoic tendency you want

1470
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
no no it's an egoic tendency you want
 

1471
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,910
no no it's an egoic tendency you want
your control

1472
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:31,920
your control
 

1473
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,210
your control
and the scary part

1474
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,220
and the scary part
 

1475
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,569
and the scary part
of having your centers from is you're

1476
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:38,579
of having your centers from is you're
 

1477
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,170
of having your centers from is you're
not in control you're not in control and

1478
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,180
not in control you're not in control and
 

1479
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,530
not in control you're not in control and
so your egoic mind will start to

1480
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,540
so your egoic mind will start to
 

1481
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,710
so your egoic mind will start to
function it will not cease that God mind

1482
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
function it will not cease that God mind
 

1483
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,650
function it will not cease that God mind
will not be integrated and you will lose

1484
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:51,660
will not be integrated and you will lose
 

1485
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,810
will not be integrated and you will lose
your Center that's that's what happens

1486
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:53,820
your Center that's that's what happens
 

1487
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,589
your Center that's that's what happens
okay so there is a relationship between

1488
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
okay so there is a relationship between
 

1489
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,170
okay so there is a relationship between
the communion of the first mind and the

1490
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,180
the communion of the first mind and the
 

1491
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,109
the communion of the first mind and the
second mind the egoic mind and the god

1492
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
second mind the egoic mind and the god
 

1493
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,450
second mind the egoic mind and the god
of mind

1494
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:04,460
of mind
 

1495
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,690
of mind
if with the cessation and the

1496
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,700
if with the cessation and the
 

1497
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,630
if with the cessation and the
reconciliation and the absence of fear

1498
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:11,640
reconciliation and the absence of fear
 

1499
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,670
reconciliation and the absence of fear
okay

1500
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,680
okay
 

1501
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,069
okay
um which is why as you increase the

1502
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
um which is why as you increase the
 

1503
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,950
um which is why as you increase the
intensity the quality of the communion

1504
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
intensity the quality of the communion
 

1505
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,609
intensity the quality of the communion
of the two bias is increased because

1506
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:21,619
of the two bias is increased because
 

1507
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:25,069
of the two bias is increased because
increased intensity has a propensity to

1508
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:25,079
increased intensity has a propensity to
 

1509
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,890
increased intensity has a propensity to
generate more self-preservation more

1510
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:27,900
generate more self-preservation more
 

1511
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,470
generate more self-preservation more
fear Okay so

1512
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
fear Okay so
 

1513
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,030
fear Okay so
if you paid attention when you did all

1514
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
if you paid attention when you did all
 

1515
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,210
if you paid attention when you did all
of your uh self-control there's a hell

1516
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,220
of your uh self-control there's a hell
 

1517
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,490
of your uh self-control there's a hell
of a lot of tension in your arm do you

1518
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:40,500
of a lot of tension in your arm do you
 

1519
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,530
of a lot of tension in your arm do you
get do you get that you you used a lot

1520
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:42,540
get do you get that you you used a lot
 

1521
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,450
get do you get that you you used a lot
of guarding uh to help you feel safe by

1522
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:47,460
of guarding uh to help you feel safe by
 

1523
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,510
of guarding uh to help you feel safe by
