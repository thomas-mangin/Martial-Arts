00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
all right so as I said in the post I

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,230
all right so as I said in the post I
don't have to eill a m but you have to

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:09,240
don't have to eill a m but you have to
 

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,030
don't have to eill a m but you have to
remember that the technique is supposed

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
remember that the technique is supposed
 

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,350
remember that the technique is supposed
to be operating more energetically than

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
to be operating more energetically than
 

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,630
to be operating more energetically than
it is

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
it is
 

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,509
it is
physically and as a

12
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,519
physically and as a
 

13
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,870
physically and as a
result external movements can be greatly

14
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880
result external movements can be greatly
 

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,310
result external movements can be greatly
reduced okay and um because my ultimate

16
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
reduced okay and um because my ultimate
 

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,310
reduced okay and um because my ultimate
goal our ultimate goal is the

18
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
goal our ultimate goal is the
 

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,069
goal our ultimate goal is the
reconciliation of the two

20
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:33,079
reconciliation of the two
 

21
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,470
reconciliation of the two
minds that skill of what that feels like

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
minds that skill of what that feels like
 

23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,549
minds that skill of what that feels like
and what that is is actually determining

24
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:39,559
and what that is is actually determining
 

25
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,590
and what that is is actually determining
what how much of a angle or an external

26
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:42,600
what how much of a angle or an external
 

27
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,549
what how much of a angle or an external
movement you do or don't do once you

28
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
movement you do or don't do once you
 

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,790
movement you do or don't do once you
feel the two minds reconcil you don't

30
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
feel the two minds reconcil you don't
 

31
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,910
feel the two minds reconcil you don't
want to keep doing gross external

32
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:48,920
want to keep doing gross external
 

33
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,670
want to keep doing gross external
movements also martially so going from

34
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
movements also martially so going from
 

35
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,110
movements also martially so going from
the physical component perspective

36
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,120
the physical component perspective
 

37
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,630
the physical component perspective
martially the bigger your movements are

38
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
martially the bigger your movements are
 

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,349
martially the bigger your movements are
the less Marshal they're going to be

40
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:58,359
the less Marshal they're going to be
 

41
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,950
the less Marshal they're going to be
they have to be small because time and

42
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
they have to be small because time and
 

43
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,270
they have to be small because time and
space is a luxury in human behuman

44
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
space is a luxury in human behuman
 

45
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,950

violence okay so a lot of times when I'm

46
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:05,960
violence okay so a lot of times when I'm
 

47
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,950
violence okay so a lot of times when I'm
left to my own self uh there's very

48
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
left to my own self uh there's very
 

49
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,469
left to my own self uh there's very
little movement that an observer can see

50
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
little movement that an observer can see
 

51
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,270
little movement that an observer can see
but yet the reaction is exactly the same

52
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
but yet the reaction is exactly the same
 

53
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,270
but yet the reaction is exactly the same
in the UK's body and that's why okay so

54
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
in the UK's body and that's why okay so
 

55
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,630
in the UK's body and that's why okay so
it looked to some that there's one

56
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:21,640
it looked to some that there's one
 

57
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,149
it looked to some that there's one
version where I grossly bring his elbow

58
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
version where I grossly bring his elbow
 

59
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,870
version where I grossly bring his elbow
in and then come

60
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
in and then come
 

61
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,390
in and then come
around I'll do it one more time

62
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
around I'll do it one more time
 

63
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,590
around I'll do it one more time
to some it look like there's a version a

64
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
to some it look like there's a version a
 

65
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,870
to some it look like there's a version a
I go to the right he goes to the left

66
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880
I go to the right he goes to the left
 

67
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,870
I go to the right he goes to the left
the elbow comes in it passes me and then

68
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:39,880
the elbow comes in it passes me and then
 

69
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,149
the elbow comes in it passes me and then
I seek the fire spiral

70
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:45,159

 

71
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,789

okay all I need to understand is not

72
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
okay all I need to understand is not
 

73
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,030
okay all I need to understand is not
that angle deviation looks with a a

74
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
that angle deviation looks with a a
 

75
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,230
that angle deviation looks with a a
right knee over here followed by my left

76
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
right knee over here followed by my left
 

77
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,429
right knee over here followed by my left
leg adjusting I don't want to understand

78
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
leg adjusting I don't want to understand
 

79
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,870
leg adjusting I don't want to understand
angles def flexion as always the elbow

80
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
angles def flexion as always the elbow
 

81
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,830
angles def flexion as always the elbow
in like that angle of deviation means

82
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
in like that angle of deviation means
 

83
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,350
in like that angle of deviation means
that I've cleared the line that's all it

84
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
that I've cleared the line that's all it
 

85
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,990
that I've cleared the line that's all it
means I've cleared the line of attack so

86
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
means I've cleared the line of attack so
 

87
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,110
means I've cleared the line of attack so
as in the video if I take the back leg

88
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,120
as in the video if I take the back leg
 

89
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,430
as in the video if I take the back leg
and step I've cleared the line so he's

90
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
and step I've cleared the line so he's
 

91
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,470
and step I've cleared the line so he's
here here's his linear line of attack

92
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:23,480
here here's his linear line of attack
 

93
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,710
here here's his linear line of attack
and as it's coming straight at me if I

94
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:25,720
and as it's coming straight at me if I
 

95
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,869
and as it's coming straight at me if I
deviate the back leg and I have done

96
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:27,879
deviate the back leg and I have done
 

97
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,589
deviate the back leg and I have done
angle deviation

98
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:30,599
angle deviation
 

99
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,070
angle deviation
I don't need to

100
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
I don't need to
 

101
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,190
I don't need to
go one two I don't need to do that so

102
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
go one two I don't need to do that so
 

103
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,990
go one two I don't need to do that so
often times I don't

104
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
often times I don't
 

105
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,070
often times I don't
sometimes as he's coming in and that was

106
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,080
sometimes as he's coming in and that was
 

107
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,270
sometimes as he's coming in and that was
all I did I didn't move at all but I did

108
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
all I did I didn't move at all but I did
 

109
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,070
all I did I didn't move at all but I did
use angle deviation that's even higher

110
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
use angle deviation that's even higher
 

111
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,070
use angle deviation that's even higher
level so same way here angle deflection

112
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,080
level so same way here angle deflection
 

113
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,470
level so same way here angle deflection
is not the gross

114
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
is not the gross
 

115
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,830
is not the gross
movement as it manifested angle of

116
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840
movement as it manifested angle of
 

117
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,470
movement as it manifested angle of
deflection is

118
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
deflection is
 

119
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,070
deflection is
he cannot come back the other way that's

120
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
he cannot come back the other way that's
 

121
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,990
he cannot come back the other way that's
what I'm trying to

122
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
what I'm trying to
 

123
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,949
what I'm trying to
do so it can be bring the elbow

124
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
do so it can be bring the elbow
 

125
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,430
do so it can be bring the elbow
in but I can make it so for example uh

126
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
in but I can make it so for example uh
 

127
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,110
in but I can make it so for example uh
go to the right if you want you see that

128
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
go to the right if you want you see that
 

129
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,070
go to the right if you want you see that
would be the

130
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,080
would be the
 

131
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,430
would be the
iupi this way he can go to the

132
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
iupi this way he can go to the
 

133
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,710
iupi this way he can go to the
right okay and as he pushes and I locked

134
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:27,720
right okay and as he pushes and I locked
 

135
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,190
right okay and as he pushes and I locked
his elbow out

136
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,200
his elbow out
 

137
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,470
his elbow out
he can't go to the

138
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480

 

139
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,190

right so he pushes and I lock the elbow

140
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,200
right so he pushes and I lock the elbow
 

141
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,990
right so he pushes and I lock the elbow
up it's very

142
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
up it's very
 

143
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,229
up it's very
subtle boom that's it you can't go to

144
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:41,239
subtle boom that's it you can't go to
 

145
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,509
subtle boom that's it you can't go to
the right now can't go to the

146
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
the right now can't go to the
 

147
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,390
the right now can't go to the
right so it looks like this is one

148
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400

 

149
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,670

version and this is the other version

150
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
version and this is the other version
 

151
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,750
version and this is the other version
but it's not it's not he still can't go

152
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
but it's not it's not he still can't go
 

153
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,270
but it's not it's not he still can't go
to the right do you guys see that okay

154
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,280
to the right do you guys see that okay
 

155
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,789
to the right do you guys see that okay
so a lot of times

156
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
so a lot of times
 

157
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,830
so a lot of times
I go ahead and take

158
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:02,840
I go ahead and take
 

159
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,630
I go ahead and take
advantage of this

160
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:05,640
advantage of this
 

161
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,710
advantage of this
smaller angle of cancellation and angle

162
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:09,720
smaller angle of cancellation and angle
 

163
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,470
smaller angle of cancellation and angle
of

164
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,480
of
 

165
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,589
of

and then the assumption is that the
 

305
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,350
and then the assumption is that the
hands uh move the Y cheat the the hands

306
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
hands uh move the Y cheat the the hands
 

307

hands uh move the Y cheat the the hands
circulate the Yang and Yin okay uh and

circulate the Yang and Yin okay uh and
 

309
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,309
circulate the Yang and Yin okay uh and
so you do do these kind of gross

310
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
so you do do these kind of gross
 

311
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,469
so you do do these kind of gross
movements but if as you're working from

332
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
uh a knife edge down fingers down okay
 

333
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,790
uh a knife edge down fingers down okay
and I hold this

334
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
and I hold this
 

335
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,030
and I hold this
on so his hand can't slide around okay

336
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
on so his hand can't slide around okay
 

337
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,110
on so his hand can't slide around okay
the full

338
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,120
the full
 

339
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,230
the full
movement and if you come around you can

340
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,240
movement and if you come around you can
 

341
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,350
movement and if you come around you can
see that it makes his elbow drop

342
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
see that it makes his elbow drop
 

343
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,949
see that it makes his elbow drop
okay

344
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
okay
 

345
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,509
okay
so the architecture the full

346
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
so the architecture the full
 

347
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,470
so the architecture the full
architecture itself if he lifts his

348
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
architecture itself if he lifts his
 

349
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,949
architecture itself if he lifts his
elbow as he would if he had to stand up

350
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:19,959
elbow as he would if he had to stand up
 

351
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,990
elbow as he would if he had to stand up
makes the pain happen you see that so

352
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,000
makes the pain happen you see that so
 

353
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,190
makes the pain happen you see that so
that's an

354
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,200
that's an
 

355
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,030
that's an
external

356
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,040
external
 

357
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,230
external
uh manipulation of how much movement in

358
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,240
uh manipulation of how much movement in
 

359
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,310
uh manipulation of how much movement in
That Elbow okay but as you come around

360
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,320
That Elbow okay but as you come around
 

361
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,750
That Elbow okay but as you come around
here is nowhere near the movement do you

362
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:36,760
here is nowhere near the movement do you
 

363
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,670
here is nowhere near the movement do you
see no nowhere near the movement and try

364
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
see no nowhere near the movement and try
 

365
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,590
see no nowhere near the movement and try
to lift your

366
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600

 

367
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,710

elbow okay so what's happening is is

368
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
elbow okay so what's happening is is
 

369
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,190
elbow okay so what's happening is is
usually on the external version people

370
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
usually on the external version people
 

371
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,990
usually on the external version people
just send inertia momentum into the

372
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
just send inertia momentum into the
 

373
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,190
just send inertia momentum into the
parts they're

374
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
parts they're
 

375
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,750
parts they're
touching but even on on the full

376
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
touching but even on on the full
 

377
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,630
touching but even on on the full
movement of the kihon waza so feel that

378
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:03,640
movement of the kihon waza so feel that
 

379
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,430
movement of the kihon waza so feel that
and now feel this you see so the energy

380
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,440
and now feel this you see so the energy
 

381
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,430
and now feel this you see so the energy
is going up the arm and taking away the

382
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
is going up the arm and taking away the
 

383
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,110
is going up the arm and taking away the
ability for things to move so if I'm

384
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,120
ability for things to move so if I'm
 

385
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,509
ability for things to move so if I'm
here you kind of roll your shoulder

386
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
here you kind of roll your shoulder
 

387
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,790
here you kind of roll your shoulder
around you see I send the energy up your

388
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
around you see I send the energy up your
 

389
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,910
around you see I send the energy up your
arm do you see gets a little harder a

390
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
arm do you see gets a little harder a
 

391
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,710
arm do you see gets a little harder a
little harder you can start lightening

392
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:19,720
little harder you can start lightening
 

393
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,829
little harder you can start lightening
it up a little harder and I'm just in

394
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
it up a little harder and I'm just in
 

395
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,910
it up a little harder and I'm just in
that body now okay and that's how I send

396
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
that body now okay and that's how I send
 

397
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,790
that body now okay and that's how I send
energy from wherever I'm touching and I

398
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:27,800
energy from wherever I'm touching and I
 

399
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,350
energy from wherever I'm touching and I
send it into the center

400
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360

 

401
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,110

so energy has to be able to to Traverse

402
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
so energy has to be able to to Traverse
 

403
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,710
so energy has to be able to to Traverse
the the human body okay and you can

404
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:37,720
the the human body okay and you can
 

405
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,949
the the human body okay and you can
achieve the same thing I can't move my

406
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
achieve the same thing I can't move my
 

407
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,910
achieve the same thing I can't move my
elbow I can't rotate a full un impinged

408
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
elbow I can't rotate a full un impinged
 

409
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,990
elbow I can't rotate a full un impinged
360° of the shoulder without actually

410
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,000
360° of the shoulder without actually
 

411
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,829
360° of the shoulder without actually
having to stop the shoulder do you do

412
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:48,839
having to stop the shoulder do you do
 

413
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,069
having to stop the shoulder do you do
you get it and that's what you're

414
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:51,079
you get it and that's what you're
 

415
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,150
you get it and that's what you're
doing in this one so it looks like I'm

416
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,160
doing in this one so it looks like I'm
 

417
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,750
doing in this one so it looks like I'm
doing Cha's version this way but I'm

418
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
doing Cha's version this way but I'm
 

419
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,949
doing Cha's version this way but I'm
not because even as I'm moving and even

420
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
not because even as I'm moving and even
 

421
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,750
not because even as I'm moving and even
if this as this hand is coming this way

422
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
if this as this hand is coming this way
 

423
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,269
if this as this hand is coming this way
the energy is you can I'll demonstrate

424
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:08,279
the energy is you can I'll demonstrate
 

425
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,790
the energy is you can I'll demonstrate
what I'm doing grossly it's going like

426
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
what I'm doing grossly it's going like
 

427
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,190
what I'm doing grossly it's going like
this you see there's a turn there that

428
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
this you see there's a turn there that
 

429
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,949
this you see there's a turn there that
makes That Elbow come in and so he's

430
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
makes That Elbow come in and so he's
 

431
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,310
makes That Elbow come in and so he's
going to let me get to the outside of

432
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
going to let me get to the outside of
 

433
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,790
going to let me get to the outside of
him and then I let him get past me and

434
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
him and then I let him get past me and
 

435
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,069
him and then I let him get past me and
then I do the

436
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079

 

437
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,590

technique so if you look it looks like

438
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
technique so if you look it looks like
 

439
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,990
technique so if you look it looks like
his arm is like that but there's an

440
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
his arm is like that but there's an
 

441
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,550
his arm is like that but there's an
energy that's spiraling up his arm that

442
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,560
energy that's spiraling up his arm that
 

443
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,949
energy that's spiraling up his arm that
without moving it like this prevents him

444
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
without moving it like this prevents him
 

445
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,509
without moving it like this prevents him
from turning it this way which is

446
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
from turning it this way which is
 

447
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,069
from turning it this way which is
exactly what you do in the gross

448
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:43,079
exactly what you do in the gross
 

449
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,150
exactly what you do in the gross
movement where you make the elbow come

450
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,160
movement where you make the elbow come
 

451
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,470
movement where you make the elbow come
in okay all

452
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
in okay all
 

453
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,120
in okay all
right thank you very much thank you
