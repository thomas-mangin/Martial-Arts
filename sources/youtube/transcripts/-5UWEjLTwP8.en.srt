what i'm touching

102
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280

 

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,309

okay so when he grabs and he's pushing

104
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
okay so when he grabs and he's pushing
 

105
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,909
okay so when he grabs and he's pushing
and he

106

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,590
and he
i ground vector

108
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
i ground vector
 

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,870
i ground vector
basically

110
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
basically
 

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,830
basically
he is feeling my ground vector

112
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
he is feeling my ground vector
 

113
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,749
he is feeling my ground vector
okay if in order for me to put his

114
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
okay if in order for me to put his
 

115
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,670
okay if in order for me to put his
energy on the ground vector

116
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
energy on the ground vector
 

117
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,830
energy on the ground vector
he can feel the ground vector he can

118
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
he can feel the ground vector he can
 

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,909
he can feel the ground vector he can
feel the ground vector okay

120
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
feel the ground vector okay
 

121
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,790
feel the ground vector okay
so if you push this here he feels the

122
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
so if you push this here he feels the
 

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,870
so if you push this here he feels the
ground back right you feel the ground

124
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
ground back right you feel the ground
 

125
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,469
ground back right you feel the ground
pressure okay

126
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
pressure okay
 

127
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,510
pressure okay
uh

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
uh
 

129
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,870
uh
now

130
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880

 

131
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,790

push on the hand and feel the ground

132
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
push on the hand and feel the ground
 

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,950
push on the hand and feel the ground
vector you feel it okay

134
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
vector you feel it okay
 

135
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,110
vector you feel it okay
push off the hand and feel the problem

136
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
push off the hand and feel the problem
 

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,430
push off the hand and feel the problem
here's the ground factor you see that

138
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
here's the ground factor you see that
 

139
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,110
here's the ground factor you see that
okay so push on the ground vector good

140
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
okay so push on the ground vector good
 

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,350
okay so push on the ground vector good
and lift one of your legs up

142
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
and lift one of your legs up
 

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,950
and lift one of your legs up
and keep pushing on the ground to see

144
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
and keep pushing on the ground to see
 

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,950
and keep pushing on the ground to see
how you took off the groundwork feel the

146
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
how you took off the groundwork feel the
 

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,510
how you took off the groundwork feel the
ground vector lift one of your legs up

148
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
ground vector lift one of your legs up
 

149
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,870
ground vector lift one of your legs up
and you're gonna see your balance

150
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
and you're gonna see your balance
 

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,230
and you're gonna see your balance
stabilizes if you see that push into it

152
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
stabilizes if you see that push into it
 

153
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,150
stabilizes if you see that push into it
there you go okay

154
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
there you go okay
 

155
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,990
there you go okay
and that will happen no matter where i

156
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
and that will happen no matter where i
 

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,710
and that will happen no matter where i
touch i'm like a rail to you push into

158
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
touch i'm like a rail to you push into
 

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,230
touch i'm like a rail to you push into
the ground vector

160
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
the ground vector
 

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,309
the ground vector
you see

162
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
you see
 

163
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,070
you see
there you go picture that you have your

164
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
there you go picture that you have your
 

165
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,909
there you go picture that you have your
leg up he's

166
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
leg up he's
 

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,749
leg up he's
he's not really balancing he's ground

168
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
he's not really balancing he's ground
 

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,830
he's not really balancing he's ground
vectoring himself

170
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

171
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,510

okay so

172
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
okay so
 

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,749
okay so
it doesn't change

174
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
it doesn't change
 

175
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,830
it doesn't change
when i'm here he should feel the ground

176
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
when i'm here he should feel the ground
 

177
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,990

180
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
well he should feel the ground vector
 

181
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,309
well he should feel the ground vector
so as i come around

182
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
so as i come around
 

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,110
so as i come around

239
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,149

the ground vector by not disengaging

240
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
the ground vector by not disengaging
 

241
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,269
the ground vector by not disengaging
from them but by using them for his own

242
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
from them but by using them for his own

try it again

246
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
try it again
 

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,070
try it again
okay so uh

248
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
okay so uh
 

249
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,350
okay so uh
when he

250
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
when he
 

251
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,389
when he
if we were going fast

252
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
if we were going fast
 

253
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,710
if we were going fast
this would be locked out by just her raw

254
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
this would be locked out by just her raw
 

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,509
this would be locked out by just her raw
aggression okay but people can counter

256
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
aggression okay but people can counter
 

257
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,630
aggression okay but people can counter
things okay and it'll feel

258
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
things okay and it'll feel
 

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,350
things okay and it'll feel
just like the disconnected uk okay uh

260
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
just like the disconnected uk okay uh
 

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,230
just like the disconnected uk okay uh
so

262
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
so
 

263
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,190
so
uh she's she's balancing herself now you

264
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
uh she's she's balancing herself now you
 

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,550
uh she's she's balancing herself now you
see so you know she she disengaged from

266
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
see so you know she she disengaged from
 

267
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,430
see so you know she she disengaged from
the ground vector because uh engage your

268
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
the ground vector because uh engage your
 

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,470
the ground vector because uh engage your
center and watch what happened you see

270
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
center and watch what happened you see
 

271
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,190
center and watch what happened you see
so

272
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
so
 

273
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,470
so
disengage

274
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
disengage
 

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,870
disengage
and then you're just on your own okay so

276
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
and then you're just on your own okay so
 

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,670
and then you're just on your own okay so
you'll feel a bunch of yin energy

278
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
you'll feel a bunch of yin energy
 

279
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,389
you'll feel a bunch of yin energy
you see and so you take the yin take

280
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399

 

281
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,310

so we'll do that one first

282
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
so we'll do that one first
 

283
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,550
so we'll do that one first
person is coming in and usually it can

284
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
person is coming in and usually it can
 

285
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,870
person is coming in and usually it can
happen but someone can counter also

286
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
happen but someone can counter also
 

287
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790
happen but someone can counter also
someone can realize oh i stepped

288
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
someone can realize oh i stepped
 

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,630
someone can realize oh i stepped
into a whole bunch of and they go

290
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
into a whole bunch of and they go
 

291
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,670
into a whole bunch of and they go
defensive you'll disengage then you'll

292
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
defensive you'll disengage then you'll
 

293
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,630
defensive you'll disengage then you'll
go right into it

294
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640

 

295
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,790

you understand

296
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
you understand
 

297
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,110
you understand
you're coming in you'll feel you feel

298
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
you're coming in you'll feel you feel
 

299
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,870
you're coming in you'll feel you feel
that her body is locked in the

300
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
that her body is locked in the
 

301
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,430
that her body is locked in the
aggression you'll feel it disengaged

302
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
aggression you'll feel it disengaged
 

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,710
aggression you'll feel it disengaged
and you come right in when it disengages

304
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720

 

305
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,870

so he has the original thing see there

306
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
so he has the original thing see there
 

307
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,430
so he has the original thing see there
it is right there

308
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
it is right there
 

309
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,269
it is right there
okay you see how it times perfectly you

310
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
okay you see how it times perfectly you
 

311
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,430
okay you see how it times perfectly you
see when her body goes relaxed there's

312
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
see when her body goes relaxed there's
 

313
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,030
see when her body goes relaxed there's
no gap

314
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
no gap
 

315
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,509
no gap
with no she disengages

316
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
with no she disengages
 

317
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,069
with no she disengages
that's not going to work okay

318
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
that's not going to work okay
 

319
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,550
that's not going to work okay
right when you feel the in space you

320
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
right when you feel the in space you
 

321
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,750
right when you feel the in space you
just follow the hidden space in

322
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
just follow the hidden space in
 

323
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,150
just follow the hidden space in
okay let's try

324
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
okay let's try
 

325
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,269
okay let's try
okay so again in kihon the prescription

326
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
okay so again in kihon the prescription
 

327
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,910
okay so again in kihon the prescription
is an assaultive behavior

328
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
is an assaultive behavior
 

329
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
is an assaultive behavior
but the

330
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
but the
 

331
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,550
but the
beginner kid the bad new kid they're

332
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
beginner kid the bad new kid they're
 

333
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,790
beginner kid the bad new kid they're
gonna disconnect but it's good to know

334
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
gonna disconnect but it's good to know
 

335
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,190
gonna disconnect but it's good to know
what that feels like because good

336
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
what that feels like because good
 

337
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,710
what that feels like because good
fighters can disconnect you they can

338
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
fighters can disconnect you they can
 

339
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,670
fighters can disconnect you they can
disengage right or people can find their

340
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
disengage right or people can find their
 

341
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,670
disengage right or people can find their
cowardice in the midst of their attack

342
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
cowardice in the midst of their attack
 

343
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,430
cowardice in the midst of their attack
and they disengage it's going to feel

344
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
and they disengage it's going to feel
 

345
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,590
and they disengage it's going to feel
yin energy okay so you should take

346
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
yin energy okay so you should take
 

347
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,910
yin energy okay so you should take
advantage of the yin energy okay

348
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
advantage of the yin energy okay
 

349
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,509
advantage of the yin energy okay
so uh

350
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
so uh
 

351
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,310
so uh
again this one is not really impossible
