okay deal you all felt that when I get

196
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,300

about here all these there's a lot of

198
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:40,730
about here all these there's a lot of
 

199
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,430
about here all these there's a lot of
weight on there okay

200
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,440
weight on there okay
 

201
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,430
weight on there okay
so what we did is we continued to move

202
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
so what we did is we continued to move
 

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,130
so what we did is we continued to move
him into that hidden space but this time

204
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,140
him into that hidden space but this time
 

205
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,680
him into that hidden space but this time
we're going to move myself into the in

206
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:50,690
we're going to move myself into the in
 

207
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,090
we're going to move myself into the in
space at the back one

208
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,100
space at the back one
 

209
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,160
space at the back one
so rather than moving him into that in

210
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,170
so rather than moving him into that in
 

211
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:02,080
so rather than moving him into that in
space I with myself into when do I do it

212
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,090
