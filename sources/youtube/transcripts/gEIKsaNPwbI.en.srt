00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
in a very difficult position to get me
 

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,019
in a very difficult position to get me
and then that it's possible if that

18
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:30,029
and then that it's possible if that
 

19
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,400
and then that it's possible if that
distance breaks down and what are we

20
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,410
distance breaks down and what are we
 

21
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,600
distance breaks down and what are we
going to do when that distance breaks

22
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:32,610
going to do when that distance breaks
 

23
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,610
going to do when that distance breaks
down now the second the distance breaks

24
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,620
down now the second the distance breaks
 

25
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,200
down now the second the distance breaks
down I want to bury the line we call

around the elbow so I'm at the hand his

56
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,010
around the elbow so I'm at the hand his
 

57
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,399
around the elbow so I'm at the hand his
hand moves too fast it's hard for me to

58
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:07,409
hand moves too fast it's hard for me to
 

59
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,620
hand moves too fast it's hard for me to
keep track of if I'm at his shoulder the

60
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,630
keep track of if I'm at his shoulder the
 

61
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,929
keep track of if I'm at his shoulder the
shoulder moves very slow but it's easy

62
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:11,939
shoulder moves very slow but it's easy
 

63
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,460
shoulder moves very slow but it's easy
for him to move his armor and a lot of

64
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,470
for him to move his armor and a lot of
 

65
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,230
for him to move his armor and a lot of
mobility to move his arm around if I

66
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
mobility to move his arm around if I
 

67
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,480
mobility to move his arm around if I
hold it at the elbow his elbow moves

68
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,490
hold it at the elbow his elbow moves
 

69
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,370
hold it at the elbow his elbow moves
slow enough that I can usually track it

70
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,380
slow enough that I can usually track it
 

71
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,649
slow enough that I can usually track it
and I can control almost all the motion

72
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
and I can control almost all the motion
 

73
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,480
and I can control almost all the motion
of the arm so it's very hard for him to

74
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:23,490
of the arm so it's very hard for him to
 

75
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,820
of the arm so it's very hard for him to
grab me or do anything to me cut me so

76
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
grab me or do anything to me cut me so
 

77
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,490
grab me or do anything to me cut me so

now that we're in here I'm presented

162
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:57,500
now that we're in here I'm presented
 

163
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,440
now that we're in here I'm presented
with a dangerous situation and I need to

164
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,450
with a dangerous situation and I need to
 

165

171
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,680
a weapon caught me or hurt me with the
weapon so this eco is our basic line of

172
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:08,690
weapon so this eco is our basic line of
 

173
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,510
weapon so this eco is our basic line of
connection to him when were in distance

174
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,520
connection to him when were in distance
 

175
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,670
connection to him when were in distance
now I would always like to get out to

176
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:12,680
now I would always like to get out to
 

177
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,770
now I would always like to get out to
distance so if I can move him away or

178
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:14,780
distance so if I can move him away or
 

179
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,259
distance so if I can move him away or
move myself for example with Akio Oda I

180
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:17,269
move myself for example with Akio Oda I
 

181
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,420
move myself for example with Akio Oda I
could move myself around the back side

182
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,430
could move myself around the back side
 

183
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,490
could move myself around the back side
of him that would be ideal for me and

184
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:21,500
of him that would be ideal for me and
 

185
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,080
of him that would be ideal for me and
what I would really like to do so

186
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,090
what I would really like to do so
 

187

understand I feel techniques are not

188
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,070
understand I feel techniques are not
 

189
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,440
understand I feel techniques are not
coming up because that's the way I'm

190
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,450
coming up because that's the way I'm
 

191
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,060
coming up because that's the way I'm
gonna get him I don't want to get him

gonna get him I don't want to get him
 

193
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,039
gonna get him I don't want to get him
that's not my goal what the why they're

194
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,049
that's not my goal what the why they're
 

195
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,900
that's not my goal what the why they're
coming up is because he's provided a

196
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:31,910
coming up is because he's provided a
 

197
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,970
coming up is because he's provided a
situation that's so difficult for me to

198
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:33,980
situation that's so difficult for me to
 

199
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,710
situation that's so difficult for me to
answer that I need to use these

200
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
answer that I need to use these
 

201
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,539
answer that I need to use these
techniques all of the Aikido techniques

202
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:37,549
techniques all of the Aikido techniques
 

203
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,970
techniques all of the Aikido techniques
work in exactly this way and they work

204
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:39,980
work in exactly this way and they work
 

205
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,220
work in exactly this way and they work
on putting me in a good position and him

206
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,230
on putting me in a good position and him
 

207
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,979
on putting me in a good position and him
in a bad position very consistently so

208
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:44,989
in a bad position very consistently so
 

209
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:46,539
in a bad position very consistently so
this is a rough idea of why these

210
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:46,549
this is a rough idea of why these
 

211
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,539
this is a rough idea of why these
techniques would arise in Aikido next

212
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:49,549
techniques would arise in Aikido next
 

213
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:50,890
techniques would arise in Aikido next
