1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,829

we're going to come down the level in

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
we're going to come down the level in
 

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,429
we're going to come down the level in
our live training environment we're

4
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
our live training environment we're
 

5
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:03,990
our live training environment we're
going to

6
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
going to
 

7
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,470
going to
put more controls in so that we have a

8
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
put more controls in so that we have a
 

9
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,549
put more controls in so that we have a
higher chance of actually cultivating

10
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
higher chance of actually cultivating
 

11
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,750
higher chance of actually cultivating
something okay

12
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
something okay
 

13
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,910
something okay
so rather than true gu where he does

14
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
so rather than true gu where he does
 

15
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,070
so rather than true gu where he does
whatever i do whatever he counters all

16
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
whatever i do whatever he counters all
 

17
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,110
whatever i do whatever he counters all
the way and i

18
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
the way and i
 

19
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,390
the way and i
address all his campaigns etc um

20
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
address all his campaigns etc um
 

21
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,950
address all his campaigns etc um
we're now going to add some control so

22
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
we're now going to add some control so
 

23
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,310
we're now going to add some control so
the first control

24
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
the first control
 

25
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
the first control
is you're not going to require the

26
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
is you're not going to require the
 

27
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,670
is you're not going to require the
immaterial connection because we're

28
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
immaterial connection because we're
 

29
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,109
immaterial connection because we're
going to start from the tactile

30
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
going to start from the tactile
 

31
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,990
going to start from the tactile
connection

32
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
connection
 

33
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,950
connection
okay um and then i'm going to focus in

34
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
okay um and then i'm going to focus in
 

35
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,030
okay um and then i'm going to focus in
on reconciling yin and yang

36
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
on reconciling yin and yang
 

37
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,470
on reconciling yin and yang
non-contestation of course work on your

38
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
non-contestation of course work on your
 

39
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,110
non-contestation of course work on your
ip and coke you

40
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
ip and coke you
 

41
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,029
ip and coke you
and so it's not very easy to figure out

42
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
and so it's not very easy to figure out
 

43
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,069
and so it's not very easy to figure out
how to do this kind of drill with these

44
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
how to do this kind of drill with these
 

45
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,750
how to do this kind of drill with these
control devices

46
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
control devices
 

47
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,869
control devices
such that i could actually do that full

48
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
such that i could actually do that full
 

49
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,869
such that i could actually do that full
live training environment of the other

50
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
live training environment of the other
 

51
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,470
live training environment of the other
day all right so

52
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
day all right so
 

53
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,709
day all right so
we start from the tactile thing and he

54
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
we start from the tactile thing and he
 

55
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,349
we start from the tactile thing and he
has a push you see

56
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
has a push you see
 

57
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,230
has a push you see
the way that he came in he had the push

58
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
the way that he came in he had the push
 

59
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,469
the way that he came in he had the push
so that's the thing i reconciled

60
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
so that's the thing i reconciled
 

61
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,030
so that's the thing i reconciled
there's there's his weight right there

62
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
there's there's his weight right there
 

63
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,990
there's there's his weight right there
you see

64
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
you see
 

65
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,830
you see
the way i did this this is where he

66
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
the way i did this this is where he
 

67
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,070
the way i did this this is where he
wants to fall so that's where i

68
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
wants to fall so that's where i
 

69
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,590
wants to fall so that's where i
play so we'll do the same thing it'll be

70
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
play so we'll do the same thing it'll be
 

71
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,470
play so we'll do the same thing it'll be
a little quicker

72
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:22,480

 

73
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,149

[Music]

74
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
[Music]
 

75
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,789
[Music]
and you'll see everything is still a

76
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
and you'll see everything is still a
 

77
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,749
and you'll see everything is still a
matter of deconstructing so i'm not

78
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
matter of deconstructing so i'm not
 

79
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,270
matter of deconstructing so i'm not
making him bend over i'm just going to

80
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
making him bend over i'm just going to
 

81
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,310
making him bend over i'm just going to
tilt him

82
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
tilt him
 

83
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,230
tilt him
take out his face

84
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240

 

85
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,670

so uh tristan you guys will go

86
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680

 

87
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,710

in anywhere i don't reconcile you

88
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
in anywhere i don't reconcile you
 

89
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,230
in anywhere i don't reconcile you
anywhere i can test anywhere i'm doing

90
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
anywhere i can test anywhere i'm doing
 

91
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,590
anywhere i can test anywhere i'm doing
something that will not

92
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
something that will not
 

93
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,710
something that will not
translate into yesterday's drill

94
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
translate into yesterday's drill
 

95
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,270
translate into yesterday's drill
where it's not partially sound this is

96
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
where it's not partially sound this is
 

97
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,230
where it's not partially sound this is
now

98
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
now
 

99
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,550
now
the drill's not working okay so here we

100
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
the drill's not working okay so here we
 

101
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,749
the drill's not working okay so here we
go

102
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759

 

103
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,950

okay so you pick that ahead of time and

104
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
okay so you pick that ahead of time and
 

105
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,790
okay so you pick that ahead of time and
you can't pick ahead of time

106
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
you can't pick ahead of time
 

107
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,710
you can't pick ahead of time
okay so i'll show you show you what you

108
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
okay so i'll show you show you what you
 

109
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,190
okay so i'll show you show you what you
did the guy came in and you're already

110
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
did the guy came in and you're already
 

111
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,790
did the guy came in and you're already
how do i how do i know you ditch out

112
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
how do i how do i know you ditch out
 

113
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,110
how do i how do i know you ditch out
wash my hands watch my hands you see how

114
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
wash my hands watch my hands you see how
 

115
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,110
wash my hands watch my hands you see how
they moved already

116
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
they moved already
 

117
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,070
they moved already
can't work i need to use his energy

118
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
can't work i need to use his energy
 

119
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,390
can't work i need to use his energy
it's his energy he's pushing you see how

120
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
it's his energy he's pushing you see how
 

121
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,550
it's his energy he's pushing you see how
he pushes he's pushing down

122
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
he pushes he's pushing down
 

123
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,150
he pushes he's pushing down
so i used to push down you push then

124
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
so i used to push down you push then
 

125
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,630
so i used to push down you push then
get him done not here this is predicting

126
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
get him done not here this is predicting
 

127
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,350
get him done not here this is predicting
and i can't predict into you wasn't

128
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
and i can't predict into you wasn't
 

129
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,150
and i can't predict into you wasn't
try it again

130
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160

 

131
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,309

okay so mechanically yes but you're

132
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
okay so mechanically yes but you're
 

133
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,150
okay so mechanically yes but you're
still choosing that technique

134
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
still choosing that technique
 

135
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,949
still choosing that technique
let his energy decide go

136
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959

 

137
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,070

good a little behind you i'm not sure

138
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
good a little behind you i'm not sure
 

139
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,670
good a little behind you i'm not sure
that would have worked

140
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
that would have worked
 

141
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,949
that would have worked
so watch the uh other one

142
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
so watch the uh other one
 

143
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,750
so watch the uh other one
he's going to get behind me dizzy go

144
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
he's going to get behind me dizzy go
 

145
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,509
he's going to get behind me dizzy go
back

146
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
back
 

147
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,110
back
so i have a couple choices he gets

148
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
so i have a couple choices he gets
 

149
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,949
so i have a couple choices he gets
behind me up

150
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
behind me up
 

151
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,470
behind me up
you see i went up or

152
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
you see i went up or
 

153
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,149
you see i went up or
he got behind me only because i stayed

154
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
he got behind me only because i stayed
 

155
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,309
he got behind me only because i stayed
there

156
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
there
 

157
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,110
there
you see that it's only because i stayed

158
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
you see that it's only because i stayed
 

159
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,550
you see that it's only because i stayed
come back

160
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560

 

161
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,630

so let's say i'm gonna predict i'm gonna

162
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
so let's say i'm gonna predict i'm gonna
 

163
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,070
so let's say i'm gonna predict i'm gonna
do that technique you'll see that it

164
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
do that technique you'll see that it
 

165
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,589
do that technique you'll see that it
doesn't look like he got behind me at

166
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
doesn't look like he got behind me at
 

167
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,990
doesn't look like he got behind me at
all

168
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000

 

169
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,630

so it's only behind because you stopped

170
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
so it's only behind because you stopped
 

171
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,229
so it's only behind because you stopped
and because you wanted to do that other

172
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
and because you wanted to do that other
 

173
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,229
and because you wanted to do that other
technique

174
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
technique
 

175
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,830
technique
instead just keep working with the

176
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
instead just keep working with the
 

177
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,670
instead just keep working with the
energy pull

178
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
energy pull
 

179
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,789
energy pull
okay try it again

180
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799

 

181
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,589

so i can't predict and i can't be

182
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
so i can't predict and i can't be
 

183
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,570
so i can't predict and i can't be
attached to the technique okay

184
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,580
attached to the technique okay
 

185
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,030
attached to the technique okay

there was a
 

243
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,510
there was a
micro moment where you had to process

244
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
micro moment where you had to process
 

245
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,150
micro moment where you had to process
that

246

that
and in that micro moment that guy won't

248
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
and in that micro moment that guy won't
 

249
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,270
and in that micro moment that guy won't
be there in a full live environment

250
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
be there in a full live environment
 

251
