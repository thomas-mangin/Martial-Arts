to we're just working on this
 

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,910
to we're just working on this
connection okay let's go so it it is

52
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
connection okay let's go so it it is
 

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,149
connection okay let's go so it it is
important that he is uh establishing the

54
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:49,159
important that he is uh establishing the
 

55
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,350
important that he is uh establishing the
initial conflict okay but what happens

56
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,360
initial conflict okay but what happens
 

57
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,030
initial conflict okay but what happens
sometimes is you're just going here and

58
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
sometimes is you're just going here and
 

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,830
sometimes is you're just going here and

62
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
okay so for example uh I go like this
 

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,670
okay so for example uh I go like this
you see that space there okay I don't

64
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
you see that space there okay I don't
 

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,550
you see that space there okay I don't

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,830

so in here is my I inhesion that's what

80
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
so in here is my I inhesion that's what
 

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,710
so in here is my I inhesion that's what
I'm using that I

82
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm using that I
 

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm using that I
in okay so to demonstrate that more uh

84
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
in okay so to demonstrate that more uh
 

85
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,350
in okay so to demonstrate that more uh
we'll have him pull okay he's pulling

86
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,360
we'll have him pull okay he's pulling
 

87
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,229
we'll have him pull okay he's pulling
okay and he's ping the whole time and I

88
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:49,239
okay and he's ping the whole time and I
 

89
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,030
okay and he's ping the whole time and I
should be able to use that

90
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040

 

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,309

adhes doesn't change the technique okay

92
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
adhes doesn't change the technique okay
 

93
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,949
adhes doesn't change the technique okay
so but it will if you're not doing it

94

okay so I've in this
 

97
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,680
okay so I've in this
