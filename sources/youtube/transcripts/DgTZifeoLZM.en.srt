okay what what i'm going to do is start
this

8
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
this
 

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:24,070
this
fine rotate rotate

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080

 

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,509

so when i'm here like this it'll look

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
so when i'm here like this it'll look
 

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,150
so when i'm here like this it'll look
like this

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
like this
 

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,790
like this
i have x y i'm going to do something a

16
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800

i have x y i'm going to do something a
little different you're going to try one

18
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
little different you're going to try one
 

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,990
little different you're going to try one
and you see how i came into this

20
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
and you see how i came into this
 

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,510
and you see how i came into this
position

22
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
position
 

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,150
position
and he went straight and now he's

24
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160

line

46
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680

 

47
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,230

it's that sweet spot

48
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240

 

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,429

his intention to try to get me starts
the geometry

52
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
the geometry
 

53
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,590
the geometry
it's not me burning him

54
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600

so there's no effort on my part
 

59
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,250
so there's no effort on my part
there's this timing

60
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,260

 

61
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,830

[Music]

62
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

63
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,910

i don't have to do this

64
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920

 

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,350

timing

66
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360

 

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,350

so always deviate before you trap

68
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,910

so

74
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920

 

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,309

then when i do it
