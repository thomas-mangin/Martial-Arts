and that's why I think the greatest
 

109
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,840
and that's why I think the greatest
function of sube is quite honestly one

110
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:08,850

now strike high mid or low with almost

114
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:14,940
now strike high mid or low with almost
 

115
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,760
now strike high mid or low with almost
no change and if he's just focusing on

difference between that and that right
 

121
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,690
difference between that and that right
so very very deceptive I also can mess

122
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:23,700
so very very deceptive I also can mess
 

123
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,730
so very very deceptive I also can mess
with the timing of my strikes when I

124
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:25,740
with the timing of my strikes when I
 

125
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,830
with the timing of my strikes when I
strike with two hands on very directly

126
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
strike with two hands on very directly
 

127
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,400
strike with two hands on very directly
like this

128
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,410
like this
 

129
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,470
like this
the weapons either going forward or not

130
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
the weapons either going forward or not
 

131
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,900
the weapons either going forward or not
going forward however when I Sabet I can

132
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:32,910
going forward however when I Sabet I can
 

133
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,729
going forward however when I Sabet I can
now mess with him so it's a feint right

134
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:34,739
now mess with him so it's a feint right
 

135
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,010
now mess with him so it's a feint right
I've set him up to mess with his timing

136
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,020
I've set him up to mess with his timing
 

137
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,479
I've set him up to mess with his timing
so he doesn't know what's going on and

138
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:38,489
so he doesn't know what's going on and
 

139
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,510
so he doesn't know what's going on and
the last the most useful deception so

140
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:41,520
the last the most useful deception so
 

141
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,979
the last the most useful deception so
that is to change the length of the

142
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:42,989
that is to change the length of the
 

143
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,380
that is to change the length of the
weapon so I can come in here and say

144
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,390
weapon so I can come in here and say
 

145
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,120
weapon so I can come in here and say
with again and gosh use the sub X to

146
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,130
with again and gosh use the sub X to
 

147
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,120
with again and gosh use the sub X to
change the length of my weapon almost

148
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,130
change the length of my weapon almost
 

149
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,130
change the length of my weapon almost
instantaneously so this action of Sabet

150
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,140
instantaneously so this action of Sabet
 

151
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,440
instantaneously so this action of Sabet
is super useful not because it makes

152
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,450
is super useful not because it makes
 

153
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,479
is super useful not because it makes
some kind of mythical magical power or

154
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,489
some kind of mythical magical power or
 

155
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,100
some kind of mythical magical power or
