he wants to punch me
his maximum power

230
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
his maximum power
 

231
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,710
his maximum power
is when he gets his weight into it

232
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
is when he gets his weight into it
 

233
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,230
is when he gets his weight into it
that's not up there

he puts his weight
 

237
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,950
he puts his weight
do you see and he's gonna

238
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
do you see and he's gonna
 

239
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,749
do you see and he's gonna
have that cant in his torso

240
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
have that cant in his torso
 

241
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,629
have that cant in his torso
the same one you use in all your

okay

246
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
okay
 

247
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,990
okay
so look where it is

248
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
so look where it is
 

249
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,990
so look where it is
drive dude like you want to knock me out

250
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
drive dude like you want to knock me out
 

251
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,510
drive dude like you want to knock me out
there you go you see that difference

252
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
there you go you see that difference
 

253
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,430
there you go you see that difference
stay there

254
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
stay there
 

255
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,189

look at the cat

256
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
look at the cat
 

257
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,110
look at the cat
in his body

258
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120

 

259
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,990

you're doing an angle of

260
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
you're doing an angle of
 

261
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,350
you're doing an angle of
deflection

262
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
deflection
 

263
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,430
deflection
and an angle of deviation

264
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440

00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
like you always do
 

269
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,790
like you always do
so

270
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
so
 

271
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,029
so
here's his line of attack

272
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
here's his line of attack
 

273
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,430
here's his line of attack
there's my angle of deviation

274
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
there's my angle of deviation
 

275
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,110
there's my angle of deviation
then my angle of reflection

276
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
then my angle of reflection
 

277
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,870
then my angle of reflection
he throws a strike

278
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
he throws a strike
 

279
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,390
he throws a strike
boom

280
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
boom
 

281
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,749
boom
same thing

282
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
same thing
 

283
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,430
same thing
angle of deflection

284
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
angle of deflection
 

285
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,110
angle of deflection
my head movement

286
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
my head movement
 

287
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,950
my head movement
angle deviation

288
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960

 

289
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,150

so i'm not just throwing him

290
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
so i'm not just throwing him
 

291
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,589
so i'm not just throwing him
over while i keep my head here so he

292
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
over while i keep my head here so he
 

293
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,309
over while i keep my head here so he
goes to strike

294
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
goes to strike
 

295
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,230
goes to strike
i'm not just doing that because you'll

296
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
i'm not just doing that because you'll
 

297
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,749
i'm not just doing that because you'll
still get tagged

298
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
still get tagged
 

299
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,670
still get tagged
is his weight

300
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
is his weight
 

301
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,710
is his weight
on the fist line no it's a little ahead

302
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
on the fist line no it's a little ahead
 

303
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,110
on the fist line no it's a little ahead
we'll go slower so you can see

304
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120

 

305
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,350

it's a little ahead

306
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
it's a little ahead
 

307
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,950
it's a little ahead
so i have to get my head

308
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
so i have to get my head
 

309
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,390
so i have to get my head
not here where it's comfortable my head

310
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
not here where it's comfortable my head
 

311
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,070
not here where it's comfortable my head
has to go

312
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
has to go
 

313
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,629
has to go
in the opposite direction

314
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
in the opposite direction
 

315
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,469
in the opposite direction
of the angle of deflection so he goes

316
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
of the angle of deflection so he goes
 

317
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,869
of the angle of deflection so he goes
i can't stay here because he's gonna get

318
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
i can't stay here because he's gonna get
 

319
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,670
i can't stay here because he's gonna get
just enough so go back where you feel

320
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
just enough so go back where you feel
 

321
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,469
just enough so go back where you feel
there that's where his power line is but

322
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
there that's where his power line is but
 

323
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,430
there that's where his power line is but
i had it going a little forward

324
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
i had it going a little forward
 

325
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,190
i had it going a little forward
so i have to go

326
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
so i have to go
 

327
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,790
so i have to go
in of that line he goes to punch

328
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
in of that line he goes to punch
 

329
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,469
in of that line he goes to punch
and i'm back here

330
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
and i'm back here
 

331
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,029
and i'm back here
when this happens okay this is not

332
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
when this happens okay this is not
 

333
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,709
when this happens okay this is not
comfortable for me

334
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
comfortable for me
 

335
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,630
comfortable for me
this is comfortable

336
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
this is comfortable
 

337
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,509
this is comfortable
but you know what's more uncomfortable

338
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
but you know what's more uncomfortable
 

339
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,710
but you know what's more uncomfortable
that

340
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
that
