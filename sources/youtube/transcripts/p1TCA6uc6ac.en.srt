1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,535
I'm Okawada from the Tokyo Aikidokai.

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:07,558
I'm presiding over the "Aikido and Japan Martial Arts Summer Festival".

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:08,702
As you can see,

4
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:12,741
many people are enjoying the Aikido training.

5
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:18,393
Before that, they were also able to watch some budo demonstrations.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:27,427
During such events, if Aikido or only one type of martial art is being practiced

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:31,307
I feel that it leads to a narrower view of the world.

8
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:36,040
Thanks to an event like this, I hope many people will feel the spread of martial arts.

9
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:42,329
I also wanted to hold this kind of event

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,693
so that people could expand their own practice and their world.

11
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:52,629
I hope we can continue to have the opportunity to mix with many people in this way.

12
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,600
Thank you very much.
