if you ever feel that foot in the
backx you don't do coo that throws being

176
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
backx you don't do coo that throws being
 

177
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,309
backx you don't do coo that throws being
counter

178
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:25,319

 

179
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,110

okay okay so if you're pushing you're

180
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,120
okay okay so if you're pushing you're
 

181
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,469
okay okay so if you're pushing you're
pushing push boom push boom okay and uh

182
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:33,479
pushing push boom push boom okay and uh
 

183
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,390
pushing push boom push boom okay and uh
so your energy is coming in and bouncing

184
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
so your energy is coming in and bouncing
 

185
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,510
so your energy is coming in and bouncing
off see okay when you pull it's going to

186
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
off see okay when you pull it's going to
 

187
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,590
off see okay when you pull it's going to
be the same thing so I'm not sitting

188
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
be the same thing so I'm not sitting
 

189
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,230
be the same thing so I'm not sitting
here going like that okay so you pull

190
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
here going like that okay so you pull
 

191
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,990
here going like that okay so you pull
pull pull me that way come on get me the

192
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,000
pull pull me that way come on get me the
 

193
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,870
pull pull me that way come on get me the
wall me to okay so the same thing you're

194
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
wall me to okay so the same thing you're
 

195
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,469
wall me to okay so the same thing you're
going to bounce this time off the top B

196
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:55,479
going to bounce this time off the top B
 

197
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,510
going to bounce this time off the top B
and it's going to make you move you see

198
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,520
and it's going to make you move you see
 

199
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,350
and it's going to make you move you see
B makes you move

200
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
B makes you move
 

201
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,510
B makes you move
and then I just keep that incrementally

202
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
and then I just keep that incrementally
 

203
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,070
and then I just keep that incrementally
going so you pull it's going to make you

204
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
going so you pull it's going to make you
 

205
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,350
going so you pull it's going to make you
move boom boom up make you move

206
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360

 

207
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,870

up here we're doing the same thing

208
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
up here we're doing the same thing
 

209
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,710
up here we're doing the same thing
you're pulling makes you

210
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720

 

211
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,589

move

212
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:27,599

 

213
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,510

verion keep it on you your lightweight

214
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520
verion keep it on you your lightweight
 

215
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:43,749
verion keep it on you your lightweight
feels way heavier

216
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759

 

217
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:52,189

on

218
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:52,199

 

219
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,390

heut so when you get here don't try to

220
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,400
heut so when you get here don't try to
 

221
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,670
heut so when you get here don't try to
pick him up bring him around in that

222
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
pick him up bring him around in that
 

223
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,589
pick him up bring him around in that
same resistance

224
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:00,599
same resistance
 

225
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,510
same resistance
boom

226
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
boom
 

227
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,070

boom same thing I just keep
 

231
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,589
boom same thing I just keep
incrementally using

232
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:08,599
incrementally using
 

233
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,230
incrementally using
that till I get

234
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,240
that till I get
 

235
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,230
that till I get
your Center over that's what's making my

236
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
your Center over that's what's making my
 

237
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,390
your Center over that's what's making my
arm go up you see not me lifting

238
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
arm go up you see not me lifting
 

239
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,990
arm go up you see not me lifting
it

240
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
it
 

241
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,390
it
boom boom just lifting it boom boom

242
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
boom boom just lifting it boom boom
 

243
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,309
boom boom just lifting it boom boom
there's

244
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
there's
 

245
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:37,710
there's
leg I'm just

246
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,720

 

247
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,149

exaggerating you're pulling

248
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:43,159

 

249
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,749

good

250
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
good
 

251
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,430
good
ground move into the in space you

252
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,440
ground move into the in space you
 

253
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:58,309
ground move into the in space you
created do it

254
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

255
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,749

again and then I start working this

256
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759

 

257
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,189

one when my arm gets high enough is when

258
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:06,199
one when my arm gets high enough is when
 

259
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,790
one when my arm gets high enough is when
his leg Center gets for forward enough

260
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:09,800
his leg Center gets for forward enough
 

261
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,270
his leg Center gets for forward enough
then I can start working this

262
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,280
then I can start working this
 

263
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,149
then I can start working this
one when I'm

264
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,159

 

265
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,270

ready

266
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,280

 

267
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,990

right that little turn is what brings

268
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,000
right that little turn is what brings
 

269
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,629
right that little turn is what brings
that leg up not

270
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:27,639

 

271
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,790

this here I did KNE to Center about

272
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:31,800
this here I did KNE to Center about
 

273
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,230
this here I did KNE to Center about
there then this shoulder

274
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,240
there then this shoulder
 

275
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,790
there then this shoulder
continues leg

276
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
continues leg
 

277
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,550
continues leg
up

278
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560

 

279
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,110

okay he so not only is it less uh

280
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,120
okay he so not only is it less uh
 

281
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,350
okay he so not only is it less uh
straining on me but because I don't have

282
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,360
straining on me but because I don't have
 

283
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,030
straining on me but because I don't have
to overcome that foot and because he's

284
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
to overcome that foot and because he's
 

285
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,389
to overcome that foot and because he's
already falling by the time I enter I

286
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:53,399
already falling by the time I enter I
 

287
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,230
already falling by the time I enter I
can use my stance now not just for

288
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,240
can use my stance now not just for
 

289
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:16,060
can use my stance now not just for
propulsion I can use my stance for

290
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,070

 

291
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,220

place
 

297
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,870
place
okay you see how I'm taking out his base

298
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
okay you see how I'm taking out his base
 

299
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,750
okay you see how I'm taking out his base
so even the most athletic person cannot

300
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:38,760
so even the most athletic person cannot
 

301
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,230
so even the most athletic person cannot
reposition their faes supp back under

302
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
reposition their faes supp back under
 

303
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:58,110
reposition their faes supp back under
their line of gravity

304
