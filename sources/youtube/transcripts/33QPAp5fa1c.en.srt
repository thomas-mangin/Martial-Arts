00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840

 

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,110

um I think everyone here that's trying

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
um I think everyone here that's trying
 

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,590
um I think everyone here that's trying
to get to the next level uh you you need

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:18,600
to get to the next level uh you you need
 

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,429
to get to the next level uh you you need
this and then Ivan I think you need this

8
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
this and then Ivan I think you need this
 

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,109
this and then Ivan I think you need this
too okay so

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,119
too okay so
 

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,429
too okay so
remember at the

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:26,439
remember at the
 

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,950
remember at the
beginning I think it's

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
beginning I think it's
 

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,589
beginning I think it's
fine even if it's

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
fine even if it's
 

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,549
fine even if it's
external to learn how to push on

18
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:35,559
external to learn how to push on
 

19
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,470
external to learn how to push on
someone's Center like where is that spot

20
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
someone's Center like where is that spot
 

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,029
someone's Center like where is that spot
on their body as opposed to like you're

22
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,039
on their body as opposed to like you're
 

23
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,950
on their body as opposed to like you're
pushing around or you're like oh That's

24
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
pushing around or you're like oh That's
 

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,790
pushing around or you're like oh That's
too great and I'm I can't push it at

26
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
too great and I'm I can't push it at
 

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,029
too great and I'm I can't push it at
all and as you all in the patreon group

28
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
all and as you all in the patreon group
 

29
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,709
all and as you all in the patreon group
have tackled the cook you said I think

30
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
have tackled the cook you said I think
 

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,830
have tackled the cook you said I think
that is uh where a lot of you are and

32
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:58,840
that is uh where a lot of you are and
 

33
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,229
that is uh where a lot of you are and
that's fine for where your ey okay um I

34
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
that's fine for where your ey okay um I
 

35
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,670
that's fine for where your ey okay um I
say keep working it so Rio for example

36
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:06,680
say keep working it so Rio for example
 

37
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,030
say keep working it so Rio for example
you you did a lot of improvement since

38
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
you you did a lot of improvement since
 

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,950
you you did a lot of improvement since
the first video uh in terms of where's

40
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:11,960
the first video uh in terms of where's
 

41
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,630
the first video uh in terms of where's
your balance to be able to push that so

42
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
your balance to be able to push that so
 

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,510
your balance to be able to push that so
if you task yourself with just being

44
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,520
if you task yourself with just being
 

45
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,350
if you task yourself with just being
able to push that you're going to start

46
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
able to push that you're going to start
 

47
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,870
able to push that you're going to start
correcting a lot of the other things

48
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
correcting a lot of the other things
 

49
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,870
correcting a lot of the other things
like the structural Integrity of the qua

50
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
like the structural Integrity of the qua
 

51
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,469
like the structural Integrity of the qua
uh where's midfoot right where's your

52
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
uh where's midfoot right where's your
 

53
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,350
uh where's midfoot right where's your
line of gravity and all that is

54
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,360
line of gravity and all that is
 

55
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,230
line of gravity and all that is
necessary okay

56
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
necessary okay
 

57
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,990
necessary okay
um but once you get to a certain level

58
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,000
um but once you get to a certain level
 

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,030
um but once you get to a certain level
you have to realize a negative

60
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040
you have to realize a negative
 

61
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,630
you have to realize a negative
consequence of that uh just pushing on

62
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
consequence of that uh just pushing on
 

63
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,550
consequence of that uh just pushing on
the center and that is that you're

64
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
the center and that is that you're
 

65
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,069
the center and that is that you're
really using skeletal alignment and the

66
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
really using skeletal alignment and the
 

67
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,630
really using skeletal alignment and the
problem with that is skeletal alignment

68
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
problem with that is skeletal alignment
 

69
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,830
problem with that is skeletal alignment
can only go in the 180 degree uh

70
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
can only go in the 180 degree uh
 

71
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,990
can only go in the 180 degree uh
opposite Vector to the push okay so if

72
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,000
opposite Vector to the push okay so if
 

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,789
opposite Vector to the push okay so if
you pay attention

74
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
you pay attention
 

75
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,069
you pay attention
as we're here you can only push back on

76
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:05,079
as we're here you can only push back on
 

77
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,950
as we're here you can only push back on
the line that he's actually pushing you

78
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:07,960
the line that he's actually pushing you
 

79
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,750
the line that he's actually pushing you
on okay um and so what that what usually

80
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:12,760
on okay um and so what that what usually
 

81
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,110
on okay um and so what that what usually
happens is you're just in their

82
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
happens is you're just in their
 

83
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,309
happens is you're just in their
shoulders you just push in their

84
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:17,319
shoulders you just push in their
 

85
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,910
shoulders you just push in their
shoulders like that that's what happens

86
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
shoulders like that that's what happens
 

87
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,270
shoulders like that that's what happens
okay and we don't want to push in the

88
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
okay and we don't want to push in the
 

89
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,110
okay and we don't want to push in the
shoulders uh because it doesn't generate

90
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
shoulders uh because it doesn't generate
 

91
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,430
shoulders uh because it doesn't generate
the center

92
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440
the center
 

93
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,830
the center
seizure and ultimately it won't be as

94
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
seizure and ultimately it won't be as
 

95
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,550
seizure and ultimately it won't be as
reliable in generating kazushi and then

96
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
reliable in generating kazushi and then
 

97
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,630
reliable in generating kazushi and then
it won't generate the Dilemma the

98
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
it won't generate the Dilemma the
 

99
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,910
it won't generate the Dilemma the
Marshal dilemma where they either don't

100
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
Marshal dilemma where they either don't
 

101
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,390
Marshal dilemma where they either don't
free their Center then you're going to

102
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,400
free their Center then you're going to
 

103
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,229
free their Center then you're going to
throw them or they now have to stop

104
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
throw them or they now have to stop
 

105
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,589
throw them or they now have to stop
their attack lose initiative in order to

106
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
their attack lose initiative in order to
 

107
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,430
their attack lose initiative in order to
free their Center okay that's the

108
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
free their Center okay that's the
 

109
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,190
free their Center okay that's the
Dilemma you want so when you're just in

110
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
Dilemma you want so when you're just in
 

111
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,030
Dilemma you want so when you're just in
the shoulders uh you won't get any of

112
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,040
the shoulders uh you won't get any of
 

113
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,030
the shoulders uh you won't get any of
that okay and uh what it is if I think

114
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
that okay and uh what it is if I think
 

115
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,630
that okay and uh what it is if I think
about it is actually let me have my

116
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
about it is actually let me have my
 

117
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,869
about it is actually let me have my
people try that and so here's the first

118
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
people try that and so here's the first
 

119
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,350
people try that and so here's the first
discovery learning is whatever drill you

120
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
discovery learning is whatever drill you
 

121
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,309
discovery learning is whatever drill you
want to don't care if it's external or

122
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:09,319
want to don't care if it's external or
 

123
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,509
want to don't care if it's external or
not but kind of pay attention maybe you

124
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:12,519
not but kind of pay attention maybe you
 

125
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,430
not but kind of pay attention maybe you
even need this person to say where they

126
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
even need this person to say where they
 

127
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,190
even need this person to say where they
where they feel it okay uh I'm sure if

128
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
where they feel it okay uh I'm sure if
 

129
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,630
where they feel it okay uh I'm sure if
you w if you slow this film down and I

130
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,640
you w if you slow this film down and I
 

131
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,990
you w if you slow this film down and I
might slow it down for you you'll start

132
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
might slow it down for you you'll start
 

133
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,990
might slow it down for you you'll start
to see that his his shoulders are moving

134
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
to see that his his shoulders are moving
 

135
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,789
to see that his his shoulders are moving
before anything else right maybe he can

136
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:29,799
before anything else right maybe he can
 

137
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,270
before anything else right maybe he can
feel the weight coming off his left foot

138
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,280
feel the weight coming off his left foot
 

139
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,550
feel the weight coming off his left foot
do you see and it's starting to move

140
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
do you see and it's starting to move
 

141
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,869
do you see and it's starting to move
those shoulders back is what's happening

142
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
those shoulders back is what's happening
 

143
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,190
those shoulders back is what's happening
okay so you might need your UK to tell

144
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
okay so you might need your UK to tell
 

145
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,149
okay so you might need your UK to tell
you where they feel it but I think that

146
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
you where they feel it but I think that
 

147
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,869
you where they feel it but I think that
you can feel it too that the the energy

148
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:45,879
you can feel it too that the the energy
 

149
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,949
you can feel it too that the the energy
is just going straight out from the

150
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:47,959
is just going straight out from the
 

151
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,670
is just going straight out from the
angle that my arms are going okay so

152
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
angle that my arms are going okay so
 

153
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,789
angle that my arms are going okay so
let's we're going to try that

154
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
let's we're going to try that
 

155
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,110
let's we're going to try that
okay

156
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,120

 

157
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,309

so now

158
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
so now
 

159
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,869
so now
the rebounding force that we're sending

160
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:03,879
the rebounding force that we're sending
 

161
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,589
the rebounding force that we're sending
out um again what is it where how does

162
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:08,599
out um again what is it where how does
 

163
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,630
out um again what is it where how does
it

164
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:09,640
it
 

165
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,990
it
actually uh manifest how does it act

166
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,000
actually uh manifest how does it act
 

167
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,749
actually uh manifest how does it act
what are its properties okay and um

168
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
what are its properties okay and um
 

169
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,509
what are its properties okay and um
let's ask the question can can it be

170
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519
let's ask the question can can it be
 

171
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,270
let's ask the question can can it be
curved through space or does it always

172
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
curved through space or does it always
 

173
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,110
curved through space or does it always
have to go on a straight line and I'm

174
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,120
have to go on a straight line and I'm
 

175
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,270
have to go on a straight line and I'm
going to say it always has to go on a

176
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,280
going to say it always has to go on a
 

177
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,150
going to say it always has to go on a
straight line okay if it'll it'll follow

178
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,160
straight line okay if it'll it'll follow
 

179
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,150
straight line okay if it'll it'll follow
the path that it's on until it acts on

180
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
the path that it's on until it acts on
 

181
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,469
the path that it's on until it acts on
something else okay so it's not that I'm

182
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:37,479
something else okay so it's not that I'm
 

183
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,070
something else okay so it's not that I'm
going to take my my

184
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
going to take my my
 

185
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,430
going to take my my
electromagnetism right all that and and

186
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
electromagnetism right all that and and
 

187
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,029
electromagnetism right all that and and
and and take control of his fascia and

188
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:47,039
and and take control of his fascia and
 

189
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,270
and and take control of his fascia and
and confuse his mind and you know now

190
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,280
and confuse his mind and you know now
 

191
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,510
and confuse his mind and you know now
the for the rebounding energy is curving

192
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,520
the for the rebounding energy is curving
 

193
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,950
the for the rebounding energy is curving
through space and so that it curves

194
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
through space and so that it curves
 

195
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,430
through space and so that it curves
through his body and then that's how you

196
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
through his body and then that's how you
 

197
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,270
through his body and then that's how you
hit the center and not the shoulders

198
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
hit the center and not the shoulders
 

199
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,270
hit the center and not the shoulders
that ass okay that's just not

200
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
that ass okay that's just not
 

201
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,310
that ass okay that's just not
true

202
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
true
 

203

true
okay so I'm going to give you a gross

okay so I'm going to give you a gross
 

205
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,350
okay so I'm going to give you a gross
example first so here here he is pushing

206
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
example first so here here he is pushing
 

207
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,510
example first so here here he is pushing
okay and what I'm going to do is instead

208
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
okay and what I'm going to do is instead
 

209
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,870
okay and what I'm going to do is instead
of just pushing and keeping the

210
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
of just pushing and keeping the
 

211
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,469
of just pushing and keeping the
relationship between our hands I'm just

212
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:19,479
relationship between our hands I'm just
 

213
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,629
relationship between our hands I'm just
going to change change that change that

physically and he'll feel the
force that I came lower where it was

230
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
force that I came lower where it was
 

231
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,029

camera and then you show us what you
 

329
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,150
camera and then you show us what you
mean my come out

330
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160

 

331
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,790

what what cuz she's she's not the

332
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:03,800
what what cuz she's she's not the
 

333
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,710
what what cuz she's she's not the
N so her push is doing what no that when

334
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
N so her push is doing what no that when
 

335
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,630

Sean was go even though he was low she

336
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
Sean was go even though he was low she
 

337
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,509
Sean was go even though he was low she
would still look like she would go up

338
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:14,519
would still look like she would go up
 

339
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,670
would still look like she would go up
and yes that that was Andre's point he

340
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
and yes that that was Andre's point he
 

341
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,350
and yes that that was Andre's point he
still in the shoulders okay um Can

342
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,360
still in the shoulders okay um Can
 

343
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,590
still in the shoulders okay um Can
anyone notice what was different between

344
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:24,600
anyone notice what was different between
 

345
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,870
anyone notice what was different between
their two cuz it's not magic the force

346
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:27,880
their two cuz it's not magic the force
 

347
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,069
their two cuz it's not magic the force

the shoulders or at least higher than

354
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
the shoulders or at least higher than
 

355
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,150
the shoulders or at least higher than
Virginia's Virginia is lower not in the

356
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,160
Virginia's Virginia is lower not in the
 

357
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,629
Virginia's Virginia is lower not in the
shoulders okay and and the line goes

358
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:42,639
shoulders okay and and the line goes
 

359
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,230
shoulders okay and and the line goes
straight the force line goes straight so

360
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
straight the force line goes straight so
 

361
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,750
straight the force line goes straight so
what is it what's

362
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:52,760

 

363
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,990

different Sean picks his foot up and

364
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,000
different Sean picks his foot up and
 

365
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,949
different Sean picks his foot up and
it's more of a step and I don't think it

366
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
it's more of a step and I don't think it
 

367
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,949
it's more of a step and I don't think it
has anything to do with the foot does it

368
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
has anything to do with the foot does it
 

369
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,069
has anything to do with the foot does it
it has has to do where it whether it's

370
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:01,079
it has has to do where it whether it's
 

371
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,269
it has has to do where it whether it's
external internal it has nothing to do

372
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:04,279
external internal it has nothing to do
 

373
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,389
external internal it has nothing to do
where is the force Vector is the

374
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
where is the force Vector is the
 

375
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,509
where is the force Vector is the
question you you could do whatever the

376
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
question you you could do whatever the
 

377
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,470
question you you could do whatever the
freak you want with everything is where

378
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
freak you want with everything is where
 

379
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,550
freak you want with everything is where
is the force Vector is it up here or is

380
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,560
is the force Vector is it up here or is
 

381
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,110
is the force Vector is it up here or is
it down here so sh has an upwards angle

382
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
it down here so sh has an upwards angle
 

383
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,150
it down here so sh has an upwards angle
going that way J has a more flat

384
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
going that way J has a more flat
 

385
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,990
going that way J has a more flat
trajectory going straight across well we

386
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
trajectory going straight across well we
 

387
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,069
trajectory going straight across well we
know it we know that it went higher I

388
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
know it we know that it went higher I
 

389
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,629
know it we know that it went higher I
wouldn't say it was exactly in her

390
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:25,639
wouldn't say it was exactly in her
 

391
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,150
wouldn't say it was exactly in her
shoulders it's a little lower okay that

392
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
shoulders it's a little lower okay that
 

393
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,550
shoulders it's a little lower okay that
that's like the third or fourth time

394
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:29,560
that's like the third or fourth time
 

395
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,910
that's like the third or fourth time
that I said that it is higher than

396
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
that I said that it is higher than
 

397
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,509
that I said that it is higher than
Virginia's it's not in the midsection

398
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
Virginia's it's not in the midsection
 

399
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,509
Virginia's it's not in the midsection
but it's not exactly in the shoulders

400
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
but it's not exactly in the shoulders
 

401
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,190
but it's not exactly in the shoulders
okay um but we did see it eventually get

402
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
okay um but we did see it eventually get
 

403
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,670
okay um but we did see it eventually get
to her shoulders okay where you saw her

404
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
to her shoulders okay where you saw her
 

405
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,550
to her shoulders okay where you saw her
shoulders move

406
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
shoulders move
 

407
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,470
shoulders move
okay so I know the reaction already so

408
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
okay so I know the reaction already so
 

409
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,590
okay so I know the reaction already so
now it's what did they do different do

410
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
now it's what did they do different do
 

411
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,590
now it's what did they do different do
you get it not not more what what how

412
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:56,600
you get it not not more what what how
 

413
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,509
you get it not not more what what how
did UK we already got that what what

414
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
did UK we already got that what what
 

415
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,990
did UK we already got that what what
they had to do something and we already

416
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
they had to do something and we already
 

417
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,470
they had to do something and we already
know that their Force line is at

418
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
know that their Force line is at
 

419
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,670
know that their Force line is at
different heights okay so what happen

420
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
different heights okay so what happen
 

421
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,150
different heights okay so what happen
and don't tell me Sean's taller than

422
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
and don't tell me Sean's taller than
 

423
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,550
and don't tell me Sean's taller than
Virginia okay it doesn't matter the

424
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
Virginia okay it doesn't matter the
 

425
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,310
Virginia okay it doesn't matter the
height they're they're

426
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
height they're they're
 

427
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,750
height they're they're
vectoring at different places on the

428
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:16,760
vectoring at different places on the
 

429
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,310
vectoring at different places on the
body

430
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
body
 

431
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,389
body
how that's the

432
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399

 

433
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,350

question okay we're going to watch it

434
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,360
question okay we're going to watch it
 

435
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,189
question okay we're going to watch it
again so we'll just use the same food

436
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,199
again so we'll just use the same food
 

437
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,110
again so we'll just use the same food
game we're going to watch him again

438
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120

 

439
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,829

watching

440
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:38,839

 

441
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:55,030

here and then we're going to watch

442
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040

 

443
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:03,670

her okay what was different

444
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680

 

445
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,910

well you see this is this is where you

446
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:06,920
well you see this is this is where you
 

447
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,710
well you see this is this is where you
you're only going to get as good as

448
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
you're only going to get as good as
 

449
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,710
you're only going to get as good as
you're observing okay if you don't if

450
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:11,720
you're observing okay if you don't if
 

451
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,949
you're observing okay if you don't if
you can't observe your deviations you're

452
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:13,959
you can't observe your deviations you're
 

453
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,949
you can't observe your deviations you're
going to just be deviating all the time

454
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
going to just be deviating all the time
 

455
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,310
going to just be deviating all the time
okay so I would tell

456
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320

 

457
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,389

you obviously I don't think this is a

458
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
you obviously I don't think this is a
 

459
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,870
you obviously I don't think this is a
slide on Sean he is where he is she is

460
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
slide on Sean he is where he is she is
 

461
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,790
slide on Sean he is where he is she is
where she is but you know this one gets

462
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,800
where she is but you know this one gets
 

463
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,910
where she is but you know this one gets
really close to me on my skill on my

464
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
really close to me on my skill on my
 

465
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,389
really close to me on my skill on my
skill right I told you that not very

466
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
skill right I told you that not very
 

467
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,750
skill right I told you that not very
long ago on that last thing that one

468
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:38,760
long ago on that last thing that one
 

469
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,629
long ago on that last thing that one
evening okay and we know that oh you

470
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:41,639
evening okay and we know that oh you
 

471
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,670
evening okay and we know that oh you
keep doing a lot of tension and things

472
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
keep doing a lot of tension and things
 

473
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,990
keep doing a lot of tension and things
like that okay

474
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
like that okay
 

475
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,990
like that okay
so but we're not exactly aware of what

476
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,000
so but we're not exactly aware of what
 

477
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,230
so but we're not exactly aware of what
we're doing okay so if you pay

478
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
we're doing okay so if you pay
 

479
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,030
we're doing okay so if you pay
attention when you push in the

480
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
attention when you push in the
 

481
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,189
attention when you push in the
shoulders you take this this grip here

482
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
shoulders you take this this grip here
 

483
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,230
shoulders you take this this grip here
and you push on the

484
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
and you push on the
 

485
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,550
and you push on the
grip you see that and what she did was

486
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
grip you see that and what she did was
 

487
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,870
grip you see that and what she did was
she's not

488
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
she's not
 

489
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,870
she's not
pushing with the part that's being

490
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:13,880
