or you could defend against that or all
kinds of stuff but

330
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
kinds of stuff but
 

331
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,749
kinds of stuff but
that getting to this closed position and

that getting to this closed position and
 

333
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,029
that getting to this closed position and
then working to the hand

334
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
then working to the hand
 

335
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,390
then working to the hand
and then trying to dump him with the

and then trying to dump him with the
 

337
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,469
and then trying to dump him with the
hand is way more difficult than going

00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
hand is way more difficult than going
 

339
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:20,950
hand is way more difficult than going
here

340
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
here
 

341
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,270

343
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,710
picking him up and dumping him right way
simpler which is something we might see

infinitely better than trying to throw

356
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
infinitely better than trying to throw
 

357
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,590
infinitely better than trying to throw
someone by their wrist

358

now that might be true if he was real

382
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
now that might be true if he was real
 

383
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,150
now that might be true if he was real
scared of getting his wrist hurt or

384
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
scared of getting his wrist hurt or
 

385
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,990
scared of getting his wrist hurt or
something he might choose to jump over

386
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
something he might choose to jump over
 

387
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,590
something he might choose to jump over
but if he's a serious guy i could

388
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
but if he's a serious guy i could
 

389
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,110
but if he's a serious guy i could
probably break his wrist and he's still

390
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
probably break his wrist and he's still
 

391
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,469
probably break his wrist and he's still
going to pound me with the other hand

392
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
going to pound me with the other hand
 

393
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,830
going to pound me with the other hand
right he's got a broken wrist but he

394
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
right he's got a broken wrist but he
 

395
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,670
right he's got a broken wrist but he
still smashed me to death with that hand

396
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
still smashed me to death with that hand
 

397
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,749
still smashed me to death with that hand
and so why would i try to throw someone

398
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
and so why would i try to throw someone
 

399
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,230
and so why would i try to throw someone
here if i had a full body clinch like

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,950
here if i had a full body clinch like
this

402
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
this
 

403
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,270
this
now he can't hit me with his other hands

404
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
now he can't hit me with his other hands
 

405
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,950
now he can't hit me with his other hands
can't kick me can't do anything

406
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
can't kick me can't do anything
 

407
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,870
can't kick me can't do anything
and i can dump him right so that's a way

408
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
and i can dump him right so that's a way
 

409
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,150
and i can dump him right so that's a way
better way so something we learn in

410

greco-roman or something
 

413
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,749
greco-roman or something

473
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,270
him with his wrist
so so that's what my answers to all

474
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
so so that's what my answers to all
 

475
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,710
so so that's what my answers to all
those things would be okay

476
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
those things would be okay

boxing jab
i'm either making distance right so if

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
i'm either making distance right so if
 

503
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,710
i'm either making distance right so if

guy getting close to me or
 

507
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,390
guy getting close to me or
if we're in mma style situation and this

508
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
if we're in mma style situation and this
 

509
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,070
if we're in mma style situation and this
guy wants to clinch with me

510
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
guy wants to clinch with me
 

511
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,830
guy wants to clinch with me
i'm going to use that to push him back

512
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
i'm going to use that to push him back
 

513
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,029
i'm going to use that to push him back
so this is what i'm doing i'm pushing

514
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
so this is what i'm doing i'm pushing
 

515
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,230
so this is what i'm doing i'm pushing
him back with my jab right

516
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
him back with my jab right
 

517
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,869
him back with my jab right
so i'm keeping the distance i want okay

518
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
so i'm keeping the distance i want okay
 

519
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,390
so i'm keeping the distance i want okay
so that's one of the primary things i'm

520
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
so that's one of the primary things i'm
 

521
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,110
so that's one of the primary things i'm
doing so

522
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
doing so
 

523
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,110
doing so
if a boxer if you're ever facing a boxer

524
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
if a boxer if you're ever facing a boxer
 

525
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,150
if a boxer if you're ever facing a boxer
and they're using a jab

526
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
and they're using a jab
 

527
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,510
and they're using a jab
one of the reasons they might be using a

528
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
one of the reasons they might be using a
 

529
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,270
one of the reasons they might be using a
jab is because they're trying to make

530
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
jab is because they're trying to make
 

531
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,670
jab is because they're trying to make
some distance for themselves and set

532
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
some distance for themselves and set
 

533
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,189
some distance for themselves and set
their ideal distance right

534
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
their ideal distance right
 

535
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,029
their ideal distance right
i.e to box you right so if i'm a

536
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
i.e to box you right so if i'm a
 

537
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,869
i.e to box you right so if i'm a
long-armed boxer particularly

538
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
long-armed boxer particularly
 

539
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,029
long-armed boxer particularly
i want this guy just i want this guy

540
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
i want this guy just i want this guy
 

541
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,230
i want this guy just i want this guy
just about this range

542
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
just about this range
 

543
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,230
just about this range
now when i'm getting him at this range

544
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
now when i'm getting him at this range
 

545
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,990
now when i'm getting him at this range
that means if i'm a long-armed boxer

546
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
that means if i'm a long-armed boxer
 

547
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,270
that means if i'm a long-armed boxer
he's not getting me back

548
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
he's not getting me back
 

549
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,029
he's not getting me back
it means if he's a grappler and i'm not

550
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
it means if he's a grappler and i'm not
 

551
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,710
it means if he's a grappler and i'm not
a grappler he can't grapple me because

552
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
a grappler he can't grapple me because
 

553
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,430
a grappler he can't grapple me because
from here

554
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
from here
 

555
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,350
from here
you see hard for him to reach reach out

556
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
you see hard for him to reach reach out
 

557
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,790
you see hard for him to reach reach out
as far as you can look at that very hard

558
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
as far as you can look at that very hard
 

559
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,909
as far as you can look at that very hard
for him to reach and get me

560
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
for him to reach and get me
 

561
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,510
for him to reach and get me
so that might be a reason i'm using my

562
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
so that might be a reason i'm using my
 

563
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,029
so that might be a reason i'm using my
jab is because i'm trying to set

564
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
jab is because i'm trying to set
 

565
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,230
jab is because i'm trying to set
distance okay

566
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
distance okay
 

567
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,149
distance okay
another reason i'm going to use my jab

568
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
another reason i'm going to use my jab
 

569
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,750
another reason i'm going to use my jab
is because i'm trying to feel

570
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
is because i'm trying to feel
 

571
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,670
is because i'm trying to feel
distance out that means i'm trying to

572
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
distance out that means i'm trying to
 

573
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,269
distance out that means i'm trying to
set up multiple shots

574
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
set up multiple shots
 

575
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,350
set up multiple shots
so what i might start doing is firing my

576
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
so what i might start doing is firing my
 

577
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,029
so what i might start doing is firing my
jab out not with the intent to super

578
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
jab out not with the intent to super
 

579
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,230
jab out not with the intent to super
hurt him and for her and that'd be great

580
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
hurt him and for her and that'd be great
 

581
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,150
hurt him and for her and that'd be great
but my intent is a quick jab

582
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
but my intent is a quick jab
 

583
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,630
but my intent is a quick jab
so i touch him and i get i get i'm

584
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
so i touch him and i get i get i'm
 

585
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,670
so i touch him and i get i get i'm
getting right there right so i'm getting

586
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
getting right there right so i'm getting
 

587
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,030
getting right there right so i'm getting
right there okay and that's what i want

588
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
right there okay and that's what i want
 

589
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,110
right there okay and that's what i want
and then i use that to follow up with

590
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
and then i use that to follow up with
 

591
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,230
and then i use that to follow up with
combination shots

592
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
combination shots
 

593
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,310
combination shots
so once i know i can tap him with my jab

594
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
so once i know i can tap him with my jab
 

595
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,990
so once i know i can tap him with my jab
i know a cross and a hook might set up

596
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
i know a cross and a hook might set up
 

597
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,430
i know a cross and a hook might set up
immediately after right so

598
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
immediately after right so
 

599
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,590
immediately after right so
i'm here and i go bang bang bang and

600
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
i'm here and i go bang bang bang and
 

601
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,509
i'm here and i go bang bang bang and
it's hard to do all this on camera but

602
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
it's hard to do all this on camera but
 

603
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,470
it's hard to do all this on camera but
that's what i'm trying to do is i'm

604
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
that's what i'm trying to do is i'm
 

605
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,990
that's what i'm trying to do is i'm
using it to feel out distance i'm

606
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
using it to feel out distance i'm
 

607
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,070
using it to feel out distance i'm
setting a distance for myself so i can

608
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
setting a distance for myself so i can
 

609
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,509
setting a distance for myself so i can
continue boxing so

610
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
continue boxing so
 

611
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,389
continue boxing so
number one make distance number two set

612
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
number one make distance number two set
 

613
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,150
number one make distance number two set
distance and feel out distance that's

614
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
distance and feel out distance that's
 

615
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,750
distance and feel out distance that's
the second reason i might use a jab

616
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
the second reason i might use a jab
 

617
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,509
the second reason i might use a jab
third reason i would use a jab is to

618
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
third reason i would use a jab is to
 

619
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,509
third reason i would use a jab is to
fluster and frustrate my opponent right

620
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
fluster and frustrate my opponent right
 

621
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:19,910
fluster and frustrate my opponent right
so

622
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
so
 

623
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,350
so
that way they start making stupid

624
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
that way they start making stupid
 

625
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,350
that way they start making stupid
mistakes and i can get them exactly in

626
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
mistakes and i can get them exactly in
 

627
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,550
mistakes and i can get them exactly in
the way i want them right so i'm just

628
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
the way i want them right so i'm just
 

629
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,949
the way i want them right so i'm just
kind of

630
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
kind of
 

631
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,550
kind of
popping him around a lot so he starts

632
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
popping him around a lot so he starts
 

633
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,070
popping him around a lot so he starts
making bad choices and starts getting

634
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
making bad choices and starts getting
 

635
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,790
making bad choices and starts getting
frustrated

636
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
frustrated
 

637
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,030
frustrated
and that might be why i use a jab okay

638
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
and that might be why i use a jab okay
 

639
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,389
and that might be why i use a jab okay

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,710
it's not doing their three objectives

right
 

703
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,310
right
so he doesn't need to make this i

704
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
so he doesn't need to make this i
 

705
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,509
so he doesn't need to make this i
wouldn't need to make distance with my

706
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
wouldn't need to make distance with my
 

707
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,110
wouldn't need to make distance with my
jab because he's already far away so i'm

708
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
jab because he's already far away so i'm
 

709
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,550
jab because he's already far away so i'm
not going to use it for that

710
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
not going to use it for that
 

711
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,030
not going to use it for that
i'm not going to use it to set distance

712
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
i'm not going to use it to set distance
 

713
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,550
i'm not going to use it to set distance
because it's not setting i'm not

714
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
because it's not setting i'm not
 

715
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,269
because it's not setting i'm not
touching him

716
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
touching him
 

717
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,949
touching him
so i might try to keep creeping up on

718
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
so i might try to keep creeping up on
 

719
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,069
so i might try to keep creeping up on
him but he's going to keep creeping out

720
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
him but he's going to keep creeping out
 

721
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,870
him but he's going to keep creeping out
i'm going to creep in he's going to

722
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
i'm going to creep in he's going to
 

723
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,910
i'm going to creep in he's going to
creep out and it's going to go on for a

724
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
creep out and it's going to go on for a
 

725
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,470
creep out and it's going to go on for a
long time

726
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
long time
 

727
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,470
long time
so that would be bad to use my jab to

728
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
so that would be bad to use my jab to
 

729
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,310
so that would be bad to use my jab to
set that distance that's bad and i'm not

730
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
set that distance that's bad and i'm not
 

731
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,430
set that distance that's bad and i'm not
going to fluster him with it because

732
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
going to fluster him with it because
 

733
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,110
going to fluster him with it because
he's not trying to come in to get me

734
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
he's not trying to come in to get me
 

735
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,550
he's not trying to come in to get me
he's not trying to set up his own shot

736
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
he's not trying to set up his own shot
 

737
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,150
he's not trying to set up his own shot
so i can't fluster and bother him with

738
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
so i can't fluster and bother him with
 

739
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,190
so i can't fluster and bother him with
my jab so

00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
i'm just probably as a boxer not going
 

743
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,790
i'm just probably as a boxer not going

00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
if i'm flustered and we'll go mega slow
 

767
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,230
if i'm flustered and we'll go mega slow
so we can stay in frame

768
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
so we can stay in frame
 

769
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,990
so we can stay in frame
but if i'm flustered and i can't get a

773
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,150
jab i'm going to start to run at this
guy

774
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
guy
 

775
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,910
guy
to throw big shots at him that's what

776
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
to throw big shots at him that's what
 

777
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,190
to throw big shots at him that's what
i'm going to do because he won't stand

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
i'm going to do because he won't stand
 

779
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,069

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
so the jab is not really something in
 

787
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,710
so the jab is not really something in

815

1138
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
but even if he doesn't what's happening
 

1139
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,590
but even if he doesn't what's happening
is i get a huge power advantage by

1140
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
is i get a huge power advantage by
 

1141
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,030
is i get a huge power advantage by
having both of my hands

1142
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
having both of my hands
 

1143
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,749
having both of my hands
on the weapon and turning the entire

1144
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
on the weapon and turning the entire
 

1145
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,230
on the weapon and turning the entire
entirety of my body around the weapon

1146
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
entirety of my body around the weapon
 

1147
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,389
entirety of my body around the weapon
and wrenching the weapon out of his hand

1148
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
and wrenching the weapon out of his hand
 

1149
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,350
and wrenching the weapon out of his hand
okay so

1150
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
okay so
 

1151
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,269
okay so
it's not really to try to throw his

1152
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
it's not really to try to throw his
 

1153
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,350
it's not really to try to throw his
whole body with this little wrist

1154
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
whole body with this little wrist
 

1155
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,350
whole body with this little wrist
it's to use the power of my whole body

1156
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
it's to use the power of my whole body
 

1157
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,430
it's to use the power of my whole body
to wrench the weapon out of his hand

1158
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
to wrench the weapon out of his hand
 

1159
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,749
to wrench the weapon out of his hand
and now we see kudagash has a really

1160
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
and now we see kudagash has a really
 

1161
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,270
and now we see kudagash has a really
good purpose

1162
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
good purpose
 

1163
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,230
good purpose
now catching it out of the air is still

1164
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
now catching it out of the air is still
 

1165
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,590
now catching it out of the air is still
going to be really challenging

1166
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
going to be really challenging
 

1167
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,949
going to be really challenging
but essentially following that knife in

1168
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
but essentially following that knife in
 

1169
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,710
but essentially following that knife in
and then being able to get a hold of it

1170
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
and then being able to get a hold of it
 

1171
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,390
and then being able to get a hold of it
or just like you would in mma

1172
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
or just like you would in mma
 

1173
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,549
or just like you would in mma
establish a basic clinch position and

1174
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
establish a basic clinch position and
 

1175
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,630
establish a basic clinch position and
then get to that knife hand from there

1176
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
then get to that knife hand from there
 

1177
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,949
then get to that knife hand from there
is what we would want to do so that's

1178
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
is what we would want to do so that's
 

1179
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,549
is what we would want to do so that's
why you would need coda guys

1180
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
why you would need coda guys
 

1181
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,230
why you would need coda guys
other ikea techniques will work the same

1182
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
other ikea techniques will work the same
 

1183
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,990
other ikea techniques will work the same
way right sankyo if we got in this

1184
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
way right sankyo if we got in this
 

1185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,549
way right sankyo if we got in this
position

1186
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
position
 

1187
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,150
position
sankyo can work the same way right so i

1188
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
sankyo can work the same way right so i
 

1189
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,070
sankyo can work the same way right so i
can use tons and tons and tons of aikido

1190
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
can use tons and tons and tons of aikido
 

1191
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,710
can use tons and tons and tons of aikido
techniques

1192
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
techniques
 

1193
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,710
techniques
in that same way why would i need to do

1194
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
in that same way why would i need to do
 

1195
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,909
in that same way why would i need to do
them because there's something

1196
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
them because there's something
 

1197
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,750
them because there's something
of a priority in this hand right so

1198
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
of a priority in this hand right so
 

1199
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,789
of a priority in this hand right so
something that's going to kill me if i

1200
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
something that's going to kill me if i
 

1201
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,830
something that's going to kill me if i
don't take it out of this hand

1202
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
don't take it out of this hand
 

1203
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,190
don't take it out of this hand
so that's why i would do those kind of

1204
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
so that's why i would do those kind of
 

1205
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,230
so that's why i would do those kind of
techniques and that's where those

1206
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
techniques and that's where those
 

1207
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,110
techniques and that's where those
techniques come from

1208
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
techniques come from
 

1209
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,470
techniques come from
old school jiu jitsu which wasn't

1210
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
old school jiu jitsu which wasn't
 

1211
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,830
old school jiu jitsu which wasn't
worried about unarmed stuff it was

1212
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
worried about unarmed stuff it was
 

1213
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,350
worried about unarmed stuff it was
worried about armed stuff weapons so i

1214
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
worried about armed stuff weapons so i
 

1215
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,029
worried about armed stuff weapons so i
need to be able to control that weapon

1216
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
need to be able to control that weapon
 

1217
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,830
need to be able to control that weapon
so that's a whole picture of why you

1218
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
so that's a whole picture of why you
 

1219
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,029
so that's a whole picture of why you
really should stop trying to do

1220
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
really should stop trying to do
 

1221
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,470
really should stop trying to do
kodagaishi off a jab right

1222

kodagaishi off a jab right
 

1223
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,630
kodagaishi off a jab right

1224
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
it's it's just it's a silly idea that we
 

1225
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,510
it's it's just it's a silly idea that we
don't need to have

1226
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
don't need to have
 

1227
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,950
don't need to have
now if we did it it would be so cool

1228
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960

 

1229
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:10,789

but come on does anyone really care

1230
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799

 

1231
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,950

no one really cares right so let's talk

1232
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
no one really cares right so let's talk
 

1233
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,630
no one really cares right so let's talk
about aikido in a practical sense and if

1234
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
about aikido in a practical sense and if
 

1235
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,990
about aikido in a practical sense and if
you want to be particularly marshall

1236
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
you want to be particularly marshall
 

1237
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,669
you want to be particularly marshall
right your iq is very marshall

1238
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
right your iq is very marshall
 

1239
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,029
right your iq is very marshall
then don't worry about trying to do it

1240
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
then don't worry about trying to do it
 

1241
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,190
then don't worry about trying to do it
off of a jab worry about how aikido fits

1242
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
off of a jab worry about how aikido fits
 

1243
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,270
off of a jab worry about how aikido fits
naturally in its own context

1244
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
naturally in its own context
 

1245
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:33,430
naturally in its own context
