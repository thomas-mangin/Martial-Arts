and they're going to attack you. There
 

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,430
and they're going to attack you. There

going to give you all the information
 

17
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,390
going to give you all the information
that I have about this stuff. Uh, and

18
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
that I have about this stuff. Uh, and
 

19
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,230
that I have about this stuff. Uh, and
that comes from a long time of playing

20
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
that comes from a long time of playing
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,550
that comes from a long time of playing
with exactly this scenario and what I've

22
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
with exactly this scenario and what I've
 

23
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,630
with exactly this scenario and what I've
discovered in it. So, uh, real simple.

24
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
discovered in it. So, uh, real simple.
 

25
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,669
discovered in it. So, uh, real simple.
I'm going to call Josh out here. We're

26
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
I'm going to call Josh out here. We're
 

27
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,470
I'm going to call Josh out here. We're
going to go to work,

28
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480

 

29
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,470

Josh. All right, we're ready to go. Uh,

30
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
Josh. All right, we're ready to go. Uh,
 

31
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,110
Josh. All right, we're ready to go. Uh,
okay. So, let's talk about what you do

32
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
okay. So, let's talk about what you do
 

33
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,510
okay. So, let's talk about what you do
when they have a knife and you don't.

34
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
when they have a knife and you don't.
 

35
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,270
when they have a knife and you don't.
So, first thing you've got to understand

36
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
So, first thing you've got to understand
 

37
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,790
So, first thing you've got to understand
is no amount of skill on earth can

38
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:47,800
is no amount of skill on earth can
 

39
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,350
is no amount of skill on earth can
compensate for the advantages they have

40
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
compensate for the advantages they have
 

41
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,389
compensate for the advantages they have
when they have a knife. Right? So look,

42
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
when they have a knife. Right? So look,
 

43
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,790
when they have a knife. Right? So look,
you could be a real buff yolked like

44
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
you could be a real buff yolked like
 

45
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,310
you could be a real buff yolked like
military trained, have been in a

46
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
military trained, have been in a
 

47
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,150
military trained, have been in a
thousand engagements, right? And and

48
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
thousand engagements, right? And and
 

49
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,750
thousand engagements, right? And and
fought for your life a million times.

50
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
fought for your life a million times.
 

51
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,590
fought for your life a million times.
And so you will be more prepared than a

52
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
And so you will be more prepared than a
 

53
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,950
And so you will be more prepared than a
grandma who came at you with a kitchen

54
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
grandma who came at you with a kitchen
 

55
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,870
grandma who came at you with a kitchen
knife. That's that's absolutely true.

56
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
knife. That's that's absolutely true.
 

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,350
knife. That's that's absolutely true.
But if you guys are even approaching

58
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
But if you guys are even approaching
 

59
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,149
But if you guys are even approaching
equal, the knife makes the other person

60
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
equal, the knife makes the other person
 

61
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,149
equal, the knife makes the other person
in a huge advantage. And I know when I

62
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
in a huge advantage. And I know when I
 

63
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,310
in a huge advantage. And I know when I
say that people go, "Well, duh." But the

64
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
say that people go, "Well, duh." But the
 

65
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,830
say that people go, "Well, duh." But the
truth is people in their heads have some

66
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
truth is people in their heads have some
 

67
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,910
truth is people in their heads have some
kind of crazy idea that like if I'm

68
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
kind of crazy idea that like if I'm
 

69
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,030
kind of crazy idea that like if I'm
trained in the arts of a screa or kie or

70
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
trained in the arts of a screa or kie or
 

71
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,270
trained in the arts of a screa or kie or
kravagga or some martial art where we

72
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
kravagga or some martial art where we
 

73
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,350
kravagga or some martial art where we
really do stuff that I'm I'm really

74
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
really do stuff that I'm I'm really
 

75
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,109
really do stuff that I'm I'm really
going to be advantageous but that's not

76
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
going to be advantageous but that's not
 

77
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,630
going to be advantageous but that's not
true at all. They always have an

78
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
true at all. They always have an
 

79
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,950
true at all. They always have an
advantage and their advantages are are

80
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
advantage and their advantages are are
 

81
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,990
advantage and their advantages are are
many, right? So one, someone has a knife

82
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
many, right? So one, someone has a knife
 

83
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,310
many, right? So one, someone has a knife
and they go like this, you could quite

84
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
and they go like this, you could quite
 

85
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,149
and they go like this, you could quite
easily die, right? So I could cut his

86
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
easily die, right? So I could cut his
 

87
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,469
easily die, right? So I could cut his
kurateed, he could die. I could cut his

88
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
kurateed, he could die. I could cut his
 

89
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,390
kurateed, he could die. I could cut his
belly, he could go into shock and sepsis

90
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
belly, he could go into shock and sepsis
 

91
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,069
belly, he could go into shock and sepsis
and all kinds of terrible stuff as his

92
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
and all kinds of terrible stuff as his
 

93
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,149
and all kinds of terrible stuff as his
guts are pouring out. So that will

94
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
guts are pouring out. So that will
 

95
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,310
guts are pouring out. So that will
literally kill him. I can't If I was the

96
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
literally kill him. I can't If I was the
 

97
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,670
literally kill him. I can't If I was the
world's strongest man, I went like this

98
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
world's strongest man, I went like this
 

99
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,830
world's strongest man, I went like this
with Josh, I couldn't hurt him even a

100
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
with Josh, I couldn't hurt him even a
 

101
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,950
with Josh, I couldn't hurt him even a
little bit, right? So maybe he'd go,

102
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
little bit, right? So maybe he'd go,
 

103
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,230
little bit, right? So maybe he'd go,
"Oh, that didn't feel good because

104
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
"Oh, that didn't feel good because
 

105
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,670
"Oh, that didn't feel good because
you're the world's strongest man." But

106
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
you're the world's strongest man." But
 

107
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,429
you're the world's strongest man." But
if I'm a normal dude, I'm not even going

108
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
if I'm a normal dude, I'm not even going
 

109
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,510
if I'm a normal dude, I'm not even going
to. That doesn't do anything, right? So

110
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
to. That doesn't do anything, right? So
 

111
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,270
to. That doesn't do anything, right? So
the power advantage of someone with a

112
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
the power advantage of someone with a
 

113
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,709
the power advantage of someone with a
knife is way bigger than your normal

114
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
knife is way bigger than your normal
 

115
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,710
knife is way bigger than your normal
power with without a knife. Okay.

116
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
power with without a knife. Okay.
 

117
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,389
power with without a knife. Okay.
Another thing is he's always going to

118
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
Another thing is he's always going to
 

119
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,309
Another thing is he's always going to
have a reach advantage. So even if we're

120
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
have a reach advantage. So even if we're
 

121
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,510
have a reach advantage. So even if we're
close, right? So look, just stick your

122
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
close, right? So look, just stick your
 

123
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,110
close, right? So look, just stick your
arm out for me. Okay? So look, Josh's

124
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
arm out for me. Okay? So look, Josh's
 

125
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,270
arm out for me. Okay? So look, Josh's
arm and my arm pretty equal in length.

126
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
arm and my arm pretty equal in length.
 

127
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,390
arm and my arm pretty equal in length.
Okay. Now look, Josh is inside of my

128
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
Okay. Now look, Josh is inside of my
 

129
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,150
Okay. Now look, Josh is inside of my
body here. He's inside of my body and

130
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
body here. He's inside of my body and
 

131
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,670
body here. He's inside of my body and
I'm not I'm just I'm touching at the tip

132
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm not I'm just I'm touching at the tip
 

133
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm not I'm just I'm touching at the tip
of his shoulder, right? So meaning if we

134
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
of his shoulder, right? So meaning if we
 

135
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,869
of his shoulder, right? So meaning if we
went like this and Josh comes in, he

136
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
went like this and Josh comes in, he
 

137
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,270
went like this and Josh comes in, he
stabs me. I can't touch Josh, right? So

138
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
stabs me. I can't touch Josh, right? So
 

139
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,869
stabs me. I can't touch Josh, right? So
he's got a huge advantage. And so that

140
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
he's got a huge advantage. And so that
 

141
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,309
he's got a huge advantage. And so that
means when we're out here, he can be

142
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
means when we're out here, he can be
 

143
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,990
means when we're out here, he can be
tacking out my arms and all kinds of

144
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
tacking out my arms and all kinds of
 

145
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,550
tacking out my arms and all kinds of
things constantly. So he has huge

146
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
things constantly. So he has huge
 

147
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,110
things constantly. So he has huge
advantages as far as his reach goes as

148
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
advantages as far as his reach goes as
 

149
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,430
advantages as far as his reach goes as
well. So he just he's he's in a way

150
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
well. So he just he's he's in a way
 

151
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,350
well. So he just he's he's in a way
better position with a knife. So as the

152
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
better position with a knife. So as the
 

153
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,110
better position with a knife. So as the
person without the knife, you have to

154
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
person without the knife, you have to
 

155
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,350
person without the knife, you have to
respect that first and foremost always.

156
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
respect that first and foremost always.
 

157
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,949
respect that first and foremost always.
You can't in your head say, "Oh, in

158
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
You can't in your head say, "Oh, in
 

159
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,309
You can't in your head say, "Oh, in
class last night, I learned how to do

160
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
class last night, I learned how to do
 

161
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,630
class last night, I learned how to do
ski, so I'm I'm totally ready." Right?

162
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
ski, so I'm I'm totally ready." Right?
 

163
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,229
ski, so I'm I'm totally ready." Right?
So you're totally not ready. Okay. So I

164
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
So you're totally not ready. Okay. So I
 

165
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,990
So you're totally not ready. Okay. So I
got to respect the weapon. And the first

166
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
got to respect the weapon. And the first
 

167
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,830
got to respect the weapon. And the first
thing I do with that is of course I try

168
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
thing I do with that is of course I try
 

169
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,830
thing I do with that is of course I try
to maintain distance. Now I want to

170
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
to maintain distance. Now I want to
 

171
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,350
to maintain distance. Now I want to
maintain uh the onestep distance with

172
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
maintain uh the onestep distance with
 

173
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
maintain uh the onestep distance with
the knife in his hand. Right? So meaning

174
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
the knife in his hand. Right? So meaning
 

175
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,190
the knife in his hand. Right? So meaning
that if he stuck his arm out right now,

176
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
that if he stuck his arm out right now,
 

177
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,270
that if he stuck his arm out right now,
this is now my eye because I include the

178
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
this is now my eye because I include the
 

179
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,670
this is now my eye because I include the
knife in that range. Now all this is

180
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
knife in that range. Now all this is
 

181
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,790
knife in that range. Now all this is
doing is this range plus gives me enough

182
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
doing is this range plus gives me enough
 

183
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,869
doing is this range plus gives me enough
reaction time to him. And I think that

184
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
reaction time to him. And I think that
 

185
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,070
reaction time to him. And I think that
can kind of be a hard thing to

186
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
can kind of be a hard thing to
 

187
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,430
can kind of be a hard thing to
understand, but you know, so if if I

188
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
understand, but you know, so if if I
 

189
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,030
understand, but you know, so if if I
went, you know, say a couple steps from

190
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
went, you know, say a couple steps from
 

191
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,309
went, you know, say a couple steps from
Josh, right? So I'm a couple steps out

192
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
Josh, right? So I'm a couple steps out
 

193
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,710
Josh, right? So I'm a couple steps out
from Josh. I know when Josh is walking

194
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
from Josh. I know when Josh is walking
 

195
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,630
from Josh. I know when Josh is walking
towards me, so I can start walking out,

196
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
towards me, so I can start walking out,
 

197
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,470
towards me, so I can start walking out,
right? So I have a huge advantage in

198
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
right? So I have a huge advantage in
 

199
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,390
right? So I have a huge advantage in
that, or not advantage, but I have a

200
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
that, or not advantage, but I have a
 

201
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,630
that, or not advantage, but I have a
huge neutralizing factor in that I can

202
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
huge neutralizing factor in that I can
 

203
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,309
huge neutralizing factor in that I can
see him coming way in advance. But if

204
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
see him coming way in advance. But if
 

205
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,309
see him coming way in advance. But if
we're in this distance, Josh can move

206
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
we're in this distance, Josh can move
 

207
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,910
we're in this distance, Josh can move
his arm so fast that I just don't have

208
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
his arm so fast that I just don't have
 

209
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,910
his arm so fast that I just don't have
the reaction time to deal with what he's

210
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
the reaction time to deal with what he's
 

211
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,149
the reaction time to deal with what he's
up to. Right? So, my first way of

212
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
up to. Right? So, my first way of
 

213
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,910
up to. Right? So, my first way of
respecting this guy who's got a weapon

214
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
respecting this guy who's got a weapon
 

215
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,750
respecting this guy who's got a weapon
that will kill me at any time is to give

216
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
that will kill me at any time is to give
 

217
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,070
that will kill me at any time is to give
as much distance as humanly possible.

218
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
as much distance as humanly possible.
 

219
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,149
as much distance as humanly possible.
And I'm always first and foremost

220
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
And I'm always first and foremost
 

221
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,750
And I'm always first and foremost
struggling for that distance. So, if

222
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
struggling for that distance. So, if
 

223
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,270
struggling for that distance. So, if
there's a struggle in it, it's me

224
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
there's a struggle in it, it's me
 

225
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,710
there's a struggle in it, it's me
struggling to maintain distance while

226
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
struggling to maintain distance while
 

227
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,550
struggling to maintain distance while
he's trying to chase me down. So, I'd

228
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
he's trying to chase me down. So, I'd
 

229
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,550
he's trying to chase me down. So, I'd
like to always stay at distance. Okay.

230
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
like to always stay at distance. Okay.
 

231
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,110
like to always stay at distance. Okay.
Now, if the distance gets broken down,

232
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
Now, if the distance gets broken down,
 

233
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,630
Now, if the distance gets broken down,
he get broken down for a few reasons.

234
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
he get broken down for a few reasons.
 

235
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,390
he get broken down for a few reasons.
He's just lightning fast and I can't

236
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
He's just lightning fast and I can't
 

237
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,149
He's just lightning fast and I can't
keep away from him faster than he can

238
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
keep away from him faster than he can
 

239
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,309
keep away from him faster than he can
come in. Two, he gets me in a corner so

240
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
come in. Two, he gets me in a corner so
 

241
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,830
come in. Two, he gets me in a corner so
I can't get away anymore. has got me

242
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
I can't get away anymore. has got me
 

243
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,509
I can't get away anymore. has got me
boxed into a corner in some kind of way

244
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
boxed into a corner in some kind of way
 

245
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,030
boxed into a corner in some kind of way
that I can't get out. Or three, he

246
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
that I can't get out. Or three, he
 

247
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,629
that I can't get out. Or three, he
surprises me, right? He's like, "Hey,

248
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
surprises me, right? He's like, "Hey,
 

249
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,909
surprises me, right? He's like, "Hey,
Josh," like, "Hey, look over there." I

250
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
Josh," like, "Hey, look over there." I
 

251
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,949
Josh," like, "Hey, look over there." I
look over there and then he comes and

252
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
look over there and then he comes and
 

253
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,629
look over there and then he comes and
kills me, right? Okay. So, those are the

254
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
kills me, right? Okay. So, those are the
 

255
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,310
kills me, right? Okay. So, those are the
three ways in which I'm not going to be

256
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
three ways in which I'm not going to be
 

257
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,469
three ways in which I'm not going to be
able to make that distance anymore. The

258
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
able to make that distance anymore. The
 

259
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,270
able to make that distance anymore. The
second that the distance is broken down,

260
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
second that the distance is broken down,
 

261
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,070
second that the distance is broken down,
I need to go active, right? So, there's

262
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
I need to go active, right? So, there's
 

263
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,230
I need to go active, right? So, there's
kind of a a middle ground. It's the

264
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
kind of a a middle ground. It's the
 

265
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,670
kind of a a middle ground. It's the
dangerous ground. Right? So, if we have

266
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
dangerous ground. Right? So, if we have
 

267
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,110
dangerous ground. Right? So, if we have
our MAI distance, so this distance plus,

268
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
our MAI distance, so this distance plus,
 

269
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,550
our MAI distance, so this distance plus,
right? So, if I'm greater than this

270
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
right? So, if I'm greater than this
 

271
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,629
right? So, if I'm greater than this
distance, fantastic. That's that's where

272
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
distance, fantastic. That's that's where
 

273
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,030
distance, fantastic. That's that's where
I want to be. Okay. If I'm inside of

274
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
I want to be. Okay. If I'm inside of
 

275
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,590
I want to be. Okay. If I'm inside of
here, that sucks because he can stab me.

276
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
here, that sucks because he can stab me.
 

277
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,430
here, that sucks because he can stab me.
But I can also start to work with the

278
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
But I can also start to work with the
 

279
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,950
But I can also start to work with the
knife and I can grab on possibly get it

280
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
knife and I can grab on possibly get it
 

281
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,070
knife and I can grab on possibly get it
out and all kinds of other things.

282
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
out and all kinds of other things.
 

283
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,390
out and all kinds of other things.
However, there's a distance that's right

284
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
However, there's a distance that's right
 

285
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,390
However, there's a distance that's right
in

286
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
in
 

287
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,710
in
about here, right? So, probably right

288
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
about here, right? So, probably right
 

289
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,870
about here, right? So, probably right
about through there. That's bad for me,

290
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
about through there. That's bad for me,
 

291
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,550
about through there. That's bad for me,
right? Real bad. And so, that d that

292
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
right? Real bad. And so, that d that
 

293
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,310
right? Real bad. And so, that d that
distance, I can't be there for any

294
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
distance, I can't be there for any
 

295
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,990
distance, I can't be there for any
length of time at all. I need to be

296
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
length of time at all. I need to be
 

297
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,150
length of time at all. I need to be
moving closer to him if I'm if I'm at

298
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
moving closer to him if I'm if I'm at
 

299
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,990
moving closer to him if I'm if I'm at
that distance or finding a really good

300
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
that distance or finding a really good
 

301
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,710
that distance or finding a really good
way to escape that. So I have to use a

302
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
way to escape that. So I have to use a
 

303
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,870
way to escape that. So I have to use a
suppression method in some way. Right?

304
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
suppression method in some way. Right?
 

305
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,790
suppression method in some way. Right?
So meaning when Josh is coming with the

306
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
So meaning when Josh is coming with the
 

307
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,710
So meaning when Josh is coming with the
knife, I have to in some way start to

308
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
knife, I have to in some way start to
 

309
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,710
knife, I have to in some way start to
suppress this. Now basically all I want

310
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
suppress this. Now basically all I want
 

311
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,150
suppress this. Now basically all I want
to do is press this knife back towards

312
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
to do is press this knife back towards
 

313
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,230
to do is press this knife back towards
Josh. I want to press it into him. So

314
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
Josh. I want to press it into him. So
 

315
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,430
Josh. I want to press it into him. So
that's what I'm thinking first and

316
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
that's what I'm thinking first and
 

317
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,950
that's what I'm thinking first and
foremost. And if the knife keeps coming

318
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
foremost. And if the knife keeps coming
 

319
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,550
foremost. And if the knife keeps coming
out, then later I can isolate the knife

320
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
out, then later I can isolate the knife
 

321
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,469
out, then later I can isolate the knife
and get it out, right? But I want to

322
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
and get it out, right? But I want to
 

323
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,670
and get it out, right? But I want to
press it in. And that's what I'm

324
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
press it in. And that's what I'm
 

325
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,390
press it in. And that's what I'm
thinking. Okay. This is what I think the

326
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
thinking. Okay. This is what I think the
 

327
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,469
thinking. Okay. This is what I think the
root of Ido is. If you look at older

328
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
root of Ido is. If you look at older
 

329
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,150
root of Ido is. If you look at older
style jiu-jitsu is like Josh coming with

330
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
style jiu-jitsu is like Josh coming with
 

331
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,469
style jiu-jitsu is like Josh coming with
an overhead strike and I just uh just a

332
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
an overhead strike and I just uh just a
 

333
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,990
an overhead strike and I just uh just a
showman. Yeah. I press press press.

334
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
showman. Yeah. I press press press.
 

335
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,430
showman. Yeah. I press press press.
Right. So that's what I'm looking to do

336
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
Right. So that's what I'm looking to do
 

337
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,189
Right. So that's what I'm looking to do
is just press into him. Now if I do that

338
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
is just press into him. Now if I do that
 

339
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,270
is just press into him. Now if I do that
he can't stab me while I'm pressing him.

340
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
he can't stab me while I'm pressing him.
 

341
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,430
he can't stab me while I'm pressing him.
Right. So the second I go oh contact I

342
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
Right. So the second I go oh contact I
 

343
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,110
Right. So the second I go oh contact I
just shove that arm in towards him.

344
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
just shove that arm in towards him.
 

345
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,790
just shove that arm in towards him.
Right now either I move him which is

346
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
Right now either I move him which is
 

347
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,950
Right now either I move him which is
fantastic or he doesn't move but his arm

348
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
fantastic or he doesn't move but his arm
 

349
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,710
fantastic or he doesn't move but his arm
gets locked up and that's fantastic. And

350
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
gets locked up and that's fantastic. And
 

351
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,469
gets locked up and that's fantastic. And
then from that position I can isolate

352
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
then from that position I can isolate
 

353
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,310
then from that position I can isolate
the hand and work from there. Right? So,

354
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,320
the hand and work from there. Right? So,
 

355
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,309
the hand and work from there. Right? So,
if I'm in the no man's land, I have to

356
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
if I'm in the no man's land, I have to
 

357
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,550
if I'm in the no man's land, I have to
push deep into Josh, right? And I want

358
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
push deep into Josh, right? And I want
 

359
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,749
push deep into Josh, right? And I want
to press that hand into him and

360
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
to press that hand into him and
 

361
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,469
to press that hand into him and
suppress. Now, when I'm pressing into

362
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
suppress. Now, when I'm pressing into
 

363
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,710
suppress. Now, when I'm pressing into
Josh, I want to be kind of careful with

364
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
Josh, I want to be kind of careful with
 

365
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,029
Josh, I want to be kind of careful with
the way I'm suppressing his his body,

366
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
the way I'm suppressing his his body,
 

367
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,469
the way I'm suppressing his his body,
right? So, meaning if Josh has the

368
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
right? So, meaning if Josh has the
 

369
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,550
right? So, meaning if Josh has the
knife's out, okay, and I am suppressing

370
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
knife's out, okay, and I am suppressing
 

371
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,950
knife's out, okay, and I am suppressing
like this, and he pulls the knife back

372
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
like this, and he pulls the knife back
 

373
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,110
like this, and he pulls the knife back
across my hands, he slices both my hands

374
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
across my hands, he slices both my hands
 

375
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,309
across my hands, he slices both my hands
open and now I'm going to lose a lot of

376
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
open and now I'm going to lose a lot of
 

377
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,830
open and now I'm going to lose a lot of
functionality like this. I need that

378
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
functionality like this. I need that
 

379
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,909
functionality like this. I need that
functionality. So, really what I want is

380
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
functionality. So, really what I want is
 

381
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,670
functionality. So, really what I want is
this kind of suppression instead. So he

382
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
this kind of suppression instead. So he
 

383
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,909
this kind of suppression instead. So he
pulls it back and that hits no no no

384
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
pulls it back and that hits no no no
 

385
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,749
pulls it back and that hits no no no
vital areas. Right? Now that's different

386
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
vital areas. Right? Now that's different
 

387
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,430
vital areas. Right? Now that's different
than this. Right? So this I don't want

388
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
than this. Right? So this I don't want
 

389
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,870
than this. Right? So this I don't want
because that's all arterial. Everything

390
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
because that's all arterial. Everything
 

391
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,230
because that's all arterial. Everything
in here is arterial, meaning it's

392
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
in here is arterial, meaning it's
 

393
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,909
in here is arterial, meaning it's
oxygenated blood. I'm going to go down

394
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
oxygenated blood. I'm going to go down
 

395
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,150
oxygenated blood. I'm going to go down
quicker than if he cuts this. But this

396
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
quicker than if he cuts this. But this
 

397
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,909
quicker than if he cuts this. But this
is the bones on the outside of my arm.

398
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
is the bones on the outside of my arm.
 

399
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,430
is the bones on the outside of my arm.
So if he comes across that, it's

400
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
So if he comes across that, it's
 

401
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,110
So if he comes across that, it's
probably not going to cause any serious

402
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
probably not going to cause any serious
 

403
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,029
probably not going to cause any serious
damage, right? There's no big ligaments

404
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
damage, right? There's no big ligaments
 

405
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,710
damage, right? There's no big ligaments
here. There's no arteries here. It's not

406
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
here. There's no arteries here. It's not
 

407
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,029
here. There's no arteries here. It's not
that vascular right here. Right? So this

408
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
that vascular right here. Right? So this
 

409
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,629
that vascular right here. Right? So this
area of the bone right here is where

410
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
area of the bone right here is where
 

411
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,230
area of the bone right here is where
you're looking to suppress with. Right?

412
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
you're looking to suppress with. Right?
 

413
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,390
you're looking to suppress with. Right?
And then as you get into a better way to

414
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
And then as you get into a better way to
 

415
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,510
And then as you get into a better way to
control, then you can start to control

416
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
control, then you can start to control
 

417
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,029
control, then you can start to control
with your hands. But you need to be kind

418
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
with your hands. But you need to be kind
 

419
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,950
with your hands. But you need to be kind
of careful of how you're getting at that

420
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
of careful of how you're getting at that
 

421
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,550
of careful of how you're getting at that
arm when you suppress. And so it needs

422
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
arm when you suppress. And so it needs
 

423
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,070
arm when you suppress. And so it needs
to be in some way that you can go from

424
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
to be in some way that you can go from
 

425
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,070
to be in some way that you can go from
here to here. You shouldn't think hand

426
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
here to here. You shouldn't think hand
 

427
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,350
here to here. You shouldn't think hand
first, right? Which is what we tend to

428
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
first, right? Which is what we tend to
 

429
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,390
first, right? Which is what we tend to
do. And you see this all the time, see

430
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
do. And you see this all the time, see
 

431
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,830
do. And you see this all the time, see
it in our drills all the time. So if

432
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
it in our drills all the time. So if
 

433
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,510
it in our drills all the time. So if
Josh is moving the knife that I'm going

434
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
Josh is moving the knife that I'm going
 

435
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,430
Josh is moving the knife that I'm going
like this constantly to just just

436
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
like this constantly to just just
 

437
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,189
like this constantly to just just
lightly move it. Yeah. So I'm going like

438
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
lightly move it. Yeah. So I'm going like
 

439
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,629
lightly move it. Yeah. So I'm going like
this constantly and every single time

440
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
this constantly and every single time
 

441
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,150
this constantly and every single time
I'm getting my hands cut, right? So I'm

442
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm getting my hands cut, right? So I'm
 

443
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm getting my hands cut, right? So I'm
getting my hands cut as I'm trying to go

444
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
getting my hands cut as I'm trying to go
 

445
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,189
getting my hands cut as I'm trying to go
like this to stop him. That's bad,

446
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
like this to stop him. That's bad,
 

447
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,469
like this to stop him. That's bad,
right? I really want to kind of be

448
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
right? I really want to kind of be
 

449
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,230
right? I really want to kind of be
pressing like this, right? doesn't have

450
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
pressing like this, right? doesn't have
 

451
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
pressing like this, right? doesn't have
to look there's if you look at modern

452
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
to look there's if you look at modern
 

453
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,670
to look there's if you look at modern
combives people like to do this stuff a

454
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
combives people like to do this stuff a
 

455
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,150
combives people like to do this stuff a
lot like ha you cannot get me right so

456
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
lot like ha you cannot get me right so
 

457
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,749
lot like ha you cannot get me right so
it's that's not quite that necessary but

458
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
it's that's not quite that necessary but
 

459
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,510
it's that's not quite that necessary but
koutay this thing that we practice all

460
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
koutay this thing that we practice all
 

461
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,350
koutay this thing that we practice all
the time this thing does exactly that so

462
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
the time this thing does exactly that so
 

463
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,350
the time this thing does exactly that so
as he comes boom like this right I did

464
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
as he comes boom like this right I did
 

465
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,029
as he comes boom like this right I did
exactly what I needed to do I got in

466
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
exactly what I needed to do I got in
 

467
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,150
exactly what I needed to do I got in
here and got to the knife and I can

468
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
here and got to the knife and I can
 

469
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,189
here and got to the knife and I can
start to work the knife okay so one I

470
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
start to work the knife okay so one I
 

471
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,710
start to work the knife okay so one I
want to give him as much distance as

472
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
want to give him as much distance as
 

473
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,909
want to give him as much distance as
possible two if he's pressed it in so I

474
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
possible two if he's pressed it in so I
 

475
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,909
possible two if he's pressed it in so I
can't make distance I need to get that

476
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
can't make distance I need to get that
 

477
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,589
can't make distance I need to get that
suppression and I need to get in close

478
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
suppression and I need to get in close
 

479
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,589
suppression and I need to get in close
to to do some kind of work to disarm

480
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
to to do some kind of work to disarm
 

481
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,869
to to do some kind of work to disarm
that knife. The way I'm going to disarm

482
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
that knife. The way I'm going to disarm
 

483
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,390
that knife. The way I'm going to disarm
that knife is to isolate it and then pop

484
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
that knife is to isolate it and then pop
 

485
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,589
that knife is to isolate it and then pop
it out. And I've done a million videos

486
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
it out. And I've done a million videos
 

487
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,550
it out. And I've done a million videos
on that. I'm not going to waste your

488
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
on that. I'm not going to waste your
 

489
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,749
on that. I'm not going to waste your
time right now with that. You can look

490
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
time right now with that. You can look
 

491
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,189
time right now with that. You can look
at it. But so from here, I'm basically

492
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
at it. But so from here, I'm basically
 

493
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,390
at it. But so from here, I'm basically
going to need some kind of grip lock and

494
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
going to need some kind of grip lock and
 

495
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,350
going to need some kind of grip lock and
then I'm going to work some kind of

496
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
then I'm going to work some kind of
 

497
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,589
then I'm going to work some kind of
disarming technique. Okay. Now, another

498
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
disarming technique. Okay. Now, another
 

499
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,869
disarming technique. Okay. Now, another
thing we have to talk about that I think

500
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
thing we have to talk about that I think
 

501
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,309
thing we have to talk about that I think
I haven't talked about much in my videos

502
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
I haven't talked about much in my videos
 

503
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,990
I haven't talked about much in my videos
yet is the fence, right? And I'm going

504
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
yet is the fence, right? And I'm going
 

505
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,430
yet is the fence, right? And I'm going
have to go other hand real quick so it's

506
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
have to go other hand real quick so it's
 

507
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,950
have to go other hand real quick so it's
easy for them to see this. Okay. So, if

508
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
easy for them to see this. Okay. So, if
 

509
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,950
easy for them to see this. Okay. So, if
Josh is uh go forward for me first.

510
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
Josh is uh go forward for me first.
 

511
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,950
Josh is uh go forward for me first.
Okay. So, Josh is here and I go in to

512
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
Okay. So, Josh is here and I go in to
 

513
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,710
Okay. So, Josh is here and I go in to
get to that knife and he's scared that

514
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
get to that knife and he's scared that
 

515
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,830
get to that knife and he's scared that
I'm going to grapple with him and take

516
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
I'm going to grapple with him and take
 

517
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,430
I'm going to grapple with him and take
the knife from him, he's going to fence,

518
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
the knife from him, he's going to fence,
 

519
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,790
the knife from him, he's going to fence,
right? So that's what he's going to do.

520
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
right? So that's what he's going to do.
 

521
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,950
right? So that's what he's going to do.
Okay, you can spend no time here because

522
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
Okay, you can spend no time here because
 

523
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,950
Okay, you can spend no time here because
time here, this is all inside the no

524
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
time here, this is all inside the no
 

525
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,870
time here, this is all inside the no
man's land, right? And he's perfectly

526
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
man's land, right? And he's perfectly
 

527
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,430
man's land, right? And he's perfectly
locked you into that no man's land. And

528
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
locked you into that no man's land. And
 

529
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,350
locked you into that no man's land. And
all he's going to do is hunt and peck,

530
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
all he's going to do is hunt and peck,
 

531
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,029
all he's going to do is hunt and peck,
right? So he's going to hunt for a spot.

532
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
right? So he's going to hunt for a spot.
 

533
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,909
right? So he's going to hunt for a spot.
He's going to peck it. Now I'm going to

534
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
He's going to peck it. Now I'm going to
 

535
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,509
He's going to peck it. Now I'm going to
try and do this. Okay, let's say I catch

536
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
try and do this. Okay, let's say I catch
 

537
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,589
try and do this. Okay, let's say I catch
him in here. This is what he's going to

538
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
him in here. This is what he's going to
 

539
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,670
him in here. This is what he's going to
do when I catch him. Okay, I'm not going

540
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
do when I catch him. Okay, I'm not going
 

541
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,470
do when I catch him. Okay, I'm not going
to keep him, right? So it's it I cannot

542
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
to keep him, right? So it's it I cannot
 

543
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,710
to keep him, right? So it's it I cannot
stay here. I can't continue to struggle

544
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
stay here. I can't continue to struggle
 

545
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,550
stay here. I can't continue to struggle
forward on the knife, right? So I I

546
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
forward on the knife, right? So I I
 

547
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,389
forward on the knife, right? So I I
can't be thinking in that way. So what

548
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
can't be thinking in that way. So what
 

549
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,389
can't be thinking in that way. So what
do I do? Well, I do all the classic

550
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
do I do? Well, I do all the classic
 

551
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,910
do I do? Well, I do all the classic
iikido techniques because they teach us

552
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
iikido techniques because they teach us
 

553
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,110
iikido techniques because they teach us
about this position whether we realize

554
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
about this position whether we realize
 

555
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,949
about this position whether we realize
it or not. Okay, this is basically

556
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
it or not. Okay, this is basically
 

557
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,870
it or not. Okay, this is basically
moonet dori, right? Okay, what am I

558
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
moonet dori, right? Okay, what am I
 

559
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,910
moonet dori, right? Okay, what am I
going to work? I'm going to try and work

560
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
going to work? I'm going to try and work
 

561
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,870
going to work? I'm going to try and work
sto maris from here. I'm going to try to

562
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
sto maris from here. I'm going to try to
 

563
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,750
sto maris from here. I'm going to try to
work ei from here. I'm going to try to

564
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
work ei from here. I'm going to try to
 

565
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,829
work ei from here. I'm going to try to
work triangles from here. Now an

566
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
work triangles from here. Now an
 

567
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,870
work triangles from here. Now an
interesting thing about the triangle

568
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
interesting thing about the triangle
 

569
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,470
interesting thing about the triangle
that maybe you think isn't true, but

570
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
that maybe you think isn't true, but
 

571
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,070
that maybe you think isn't true, but
look, if I come out here when he starts

572
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
look, if I come out here when he starts
 

573
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,710
look, if I come out here when he starts
hunting to get me, oh look at that. My

574
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
hunting to get me, oh look at that. My
 

575
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,790
hunting to get me, oh look at that. My
triangle can keep him from stabbing me.

576
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
triangle can keep him from stabbing me.
 

577
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,030
triangle can keep him from stabbing me.
So, if I triangle his fence, essentially

578
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
So, if I triangle his fence, essentially
 

579
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,870
So, if I triangle his fence, essentially
I'm fencing his fence. It makes it real

580
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm fencing his fence. It makes it real
 

581
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,230
I'm fencing his fence. It makes it real
hard for him to stab me. Not impossible.

582
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
hard for him to stab me. Not impossible.
 

583
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,269
hard for him to stab me. Not impossible.
I wouldn't want to hang out there all

584
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
I wouldn't want to hang out there all
 

585
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,870
I wouldn't want to hang out there all
day, but but that's what I'm looking

586
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
day, but but that's what I'm looking
 

587
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,910
day, but but that's what I'm looking
for. Now, if you do manage to get a hold

588
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
for. Now, if you do manage to get a hold
 

589
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,150
for. Now, if you do manage to get a hold
of the hand, you can work that into your

590
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
of the hand, you can work that into your
 

591
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,829
of the hand, you can work that into your
disarming, right? So, let's say he's

592
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
disarming, right? So, let's say he's
 

593
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,350
disarming, right? So, let's say he's
fenced me and I do manage to get a hold

594
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
fenced me and I do manage to get a hold
 

595
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,710
fenced me and I do manage to get a hold
of the hand and he can't pull it away,

596
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
of the hand and he can't pull it away,
 

597
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,990
of the hand and he can't pull it away,
right? Which is probably he's probably

598
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
right? Which is probably he's probably
 

599
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,910
right? Which is probably he's probably
going to get it. I can use all of this

600
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
going to get it. I can use all of this
 

601
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,990
going to get it. I can use all of this
as part of my getting in, right? So, I

602
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
as part of my getting in, right? So, I
 

603
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,670
as part of my getting in, right? So, I
can use the whole kind of thing as one

604
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
can use the whole kind of thing as one
 

605
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,829
can use the whole kind of thing as one
one idea. But understand the second he

606
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
one idea. But understand the second he
 

607
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,430
one idea. But understand the second he
fences you, the second you see that hand

608
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
fences you, the second you see that hand
 

609
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,030
fences you, the second you see that hand
start to come out like that, you can't

610
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
start to come out like that, you can't
 

611
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,269
start to come out like that, you can't
stay here. You have to be working Tino

612
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
stay here. You have to be working Tino
 

613
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,630
stay here. You have to be working Tino
Hinko, right? And that Tino Hinko is

614
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
Hinko, right? And that Tino Hinko is
 

615
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,389
Hinko, right? And that Tino Hinko is
going to be one of the basic Tino, but

616
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
going to be one of the basic Tino, but
 

617
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,910
going to be one of the basic Tino, but
that's the objective. And quit worrying

618
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
that's the objective. And quit worrying
 

619
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,110
that's the objective. And quit worrying
about the knife because it's going to

620
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
about the knife because it's going to
 

621
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,110
about the knife because it's going to
stab you anyways. So if you hunt the

622
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
stab you anyways. So if you hunt the
 

623
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,710
stab you anyways. So if you hunt the
knife, I guarantee he'll hold you there

624
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
knife, I guarantee he'll hold you there
 

625
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,870
knife, I guarantee he'll hold you there
and stab you. But if you work the hand

626
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
and stab you. But if you work the hand
 

627
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,389
and stab you. But if you work the hand
that's holding you, you're much more

628
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
that's holding you, you're much more
 

629
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,790
that's holding you, you're much more
likely to get free. So that's a real

630
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
likely to get free. So that's a real
 

631
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,630
likely to get free. So that's a real
basic way of how you approach someone

632
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
basic way of how you approach someone
 

633
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,990
basic way of how you approach someone
who has a knife when you don't have a

634
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
who has a knife when you don't have a
 

635
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,829
who has a knife when you don't have a
knife. That I did leave off some

636
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
knife. That I did leave off some
 

637
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,350
knife. That I did leave off some
important things you should think about.

638
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
important things you should think about.
 

639
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,430
important things you should think about.
throw right? So, I think that's

640
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
throw right? So, I think that's
 

641
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,269
throw right? So, I think that's
number one. Start throwing all the

642
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
number one. Start throwing all the
 

643
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,030
number one. Start throwing all the
you can throw. So, you know, if I if I

644
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
you can throw. So, you know, if I if I
 

645
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,470
you can throw. So, you know, if I if I
see a guy with a knife and I'm like,

646
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
see a guy with a knife and I'm like,
 

647
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,150
see a guy with a knife and I'm like,
"Hey, man, cool out." I'm picking up

648
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
"Hey, man, cool out." I'm picking up
 

649
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,750
"Hey, man, cool out." I'm picking up
everything and I'm hucking it at him

650
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
everything and I'm hucking it at him
 

651
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,069
everything and I'm hucking it at him
because I want him to freak out and

652
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
because I want him to freak out and
 

653
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,350
because I want him to freak out and
leave. That's what I want him to do,

654
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
leave. That's what I want him to do,
 

655
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,870
leave. That's what I want him to do,
right? To like lose his nerve and

656
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
right? To like lose his nerve and
 

657
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,069
right? To like lose his nerve and
hopefully other people see me throwing

658
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
hopefully other people see me throwing
 

659
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,350
hopefully other people see me throwing
 and they come throw too. And

660
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
and they come throw too. And
 

661
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,269
and they come throw too. And
then he goes away, right? So, I want to

662
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
then he goes away, right? So, I want to
 

663
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,509
then he goes away, right? So, I want to
throw If I can get any kind of

664
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
throw If I can get any kind of
 

665
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,269
throw If I can get any kind of
longer weapon in my hand, I want to get

666
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
longer weapon in my hand, I want to get
 

667
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,350
longer weapon in my hand, I want to get
a longer weapon in my hand. Now, I don't

668
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
a longer weapon in my hand. Now, I don't
 

669
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,269
a longer weapon in my hand. Now, I don't
advise going to a shorter weapon because

670
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
advise going to a shorter weapon because
 

671
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,710
advise going to a shorter weapon because
that's going to get you in a bad way.

672
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
that's going to get you in a bad way.
 

673
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,990
that's going to get you in a bad way.
So, I got some brass knuckles. I'm going

674
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
So, I got some brass knuckles. I'm going
 

675
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,670
So, I got some brass knuckles. I'm going
to put them on and all that's stupid

676
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
to put them on and all that's stupid
 

677
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,110
to put them on and all that's stupid
idea. I've got a knife. I'm going to

678
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
idea. I've got a knife. I'm going to
 

679
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,190
idea. I've got a knife. I'm going to
pull my knife. That's a stupid idea. But

680
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
pull my knife. That's a stupid idea. But
 

681
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,870
pull my knife. That's a stupid idea. But
I'm going to take my coat off and whap

682
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm going to take my coat off and whap
 

683
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,230
I'm going to take my coat off and whap
it at him. Okay, that's good. I'm going

684
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
it at him. Okay, that's good. I'm going
 

685
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,150
it at him. Okay, that's good. I'm going
to pick up a chair and hit him with the

686
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
to pick up a chair and hit him with the
 

687
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,350
to pick up a chair and hit him with the
chair. That's a great idea. I'm going to

688
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
chair. That's a great idea. I'm going to
 

689
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,710
chair. That's a great idea. I'm going to
pick a fire extinguisher, spray him with

690
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
pick a fire extinguisher, spray him with
 

691
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,150
pick a fire extinguisher, spray him with
him, and conchk him with it. That's a

692
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
him, and conchk him with it. That's a
 

693
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,670
him, and conchk him with it. That's a
good idea, right? So, anything I can get

694
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
good idea, right? So, anything I can get
 

695
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
good idea, right? So, anything I can get
in my hand to help me deal that's with

696
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
in my hand to help me deal that's with
 

697
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
in my hand to help me deal that's with
that weapon that's a longer offers me a

698
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
that weapon that's a longer offers me a
 

699
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,790
that weapon that's a longer offers me a
length advantage over that weapon,

700
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
length advantage over that weapon,
 

701
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,389
length advantage over that weapon,
that's what I'm going to do, right? So,

702
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
that's what I'm going to do, right? So,
 

703
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,069
that's what I'm going to do, right? So,
so if I could get something in my hand,

704
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
so if I could get something in my hand,
 

705
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,590
so if I could get something in my hand,
I would get something in my hand. I left

706
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
I would get something in my hand. I left
 

707
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,030
I would get something in my hand. I left
that off because I was assuming there

708
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
that off because I was assuming there
 

709
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,230
that off because I was assuming there
was absolutely nothing in the hand. But

710
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
was absolutely nothing in the hand. But
 

711
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,430
was absolutely nothing in the hand. But
if you can put something in the hand, do

712
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
if you can put something in the hand, do
 

713
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,350
if you can put something in the hand, do
it. So that's your basic idea of what

714
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
it. So that's your basic idea of what
 

715
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,230
it. So that's your basic idea of what
you're going to do when someone has a

716
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
you're going to do when someone has a
 

717
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,430
you're going to do when someone has a
knife. That's a much more realistic

718
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
knife. That's a much more realistic
 

719
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,949
knife. That's a much more realistic
approach than this like I'm going to do

720
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
approach than this like I'm going to do
 

721
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,630
approach than this like I'm going to do
all this stuff. Now, that's not saying

722
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
all this stuff. Now, that's not saying
 

723
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,310
all this stuff. Now, that's not saying
that you don't need to know disarms and

724
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
that you don't need to know disarms and
 

725
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,509
that you don't need to know disarms and
stuff because a situation might arise

726
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
stuff because a situation might arise
 

727
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,269
stuff because a situation might arise
and you might need to use the disarm.

728
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
and you might need to use the disarm.
 

729
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,590
and you might need to use the disarm.
But it's just your key idea is to stay

730
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
But it's just your key idea is to stay
 

731
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,030
But it's just your key idea is to stay
at distance. That's your number one idea

732
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
at distance. That's your number one idea
 

733
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,069
at distance. That's your number one idea
and that's what you're always working

734
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
and that's what you're always working
 

735
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,750
and that's what you're always working
for. And only if that distance breaking

736
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
for. And only if that distance breaking
 

737
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,670
for. And only if that distance breaking
breaks down do you start going to other

738
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
breaks down do you start going to other
 

739
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,350
breaks down do you start going to other
things. You don't want to try to

740
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
things. You don't want to try to
 

741
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,790
things. You don't want to try to
grapple. If you saw the video with Maya

742
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
grapple. If you saw the video with Maya
 

743
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,870
grapple. If you saw the video with Maya
and Josh, Maya grappling with Josh was

744
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
and Josh, Maya grappling with Josh was
 

745
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,470
and Josh, Maya grappling with Josh was
way worse for her than Maya trying to do

746
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
way worse for her than Maya trying to do
 

747
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,910
way worse for her than Maya trying to do
Iikido, which is keeping that distance

748
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
Iikido, which is keeping that distance
 

749
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,829
Iikido, which is keeping that distance
with Josh. Right. So, all right. I think

750
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
with Josh. Right. So, all right. I think
 

751
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,190
with Josh. Right. So, all right. I think
I've ended this video like three times

752
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
I've ended this video like three times
 

753
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,550
I've ended this video like three times
now. So, I'm really going to end it this

754
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
now. So, I'm really going to end it this
 

755
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,310
now. So, I'm really going to end it this
time. All right. So, I'm Christopher

756
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
time. All right. So, I'm Christopher
 

757
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,230
time. All right. So, I'm Christopher

McDaniel's behind that camera right

760
