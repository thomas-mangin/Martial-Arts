look so this isn't a practical technique
 

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,690
look so this isn't a practical technique
but

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:05,700
but
 

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,169

so this is the entry
 

43
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,650
so this is the entry
if

44
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,660
if
 

45
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,070
if
I'm a little slow and he comes and I get

46
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm a little slow and he comes and I get
 

47
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,289

stop him so that means that uh
 

55
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,969
stop him so that means that uh
I wasn't quick enough

56
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:19,979
