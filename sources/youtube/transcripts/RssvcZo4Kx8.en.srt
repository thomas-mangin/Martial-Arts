00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
but they're
 

103
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,350
but they're
looming threats that the person has to

104
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
looming threats that the person has to
 

105
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,309
looming threats that the person has to
address

address
 

107
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,430
address
and it's the looming threat that sets

108
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
and it's the looming threat that sets
 

109
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,830

them up for the pins
 

111
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,309
them up for the pins
and the throws if there's no looming

112
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
and the throws if there's no looming
 

113
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,070
and the throws if there's no looming
threat

114
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
threat
 

115
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,190
threat
let's just take an example he can take

116
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
let's just take an example he can take
 

117
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,229
let's just take an example he can take
his sweet ass

118
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
his sweet ass
 

119
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,270

time bridging the gap do you get it and

120
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
time bridging the gap do you get it and
 

121
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,910
time bridging the gap do you get it and
then you'll

122
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
then you'll
 

123
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,229
then you'll
never get any kind of inertia going so

124
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239

okay everyone knows how to attack and

178
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
okay everyone knows how to attack and
 

179
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,469
okay everyone knows how to attack and
you're not doing stupid

180
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
you're not doing stupid
 

181
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,909
you're not doing stupid
so uh

182
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
so uh
 

183
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,030
so uh
come in with this goofy joe down ski

184
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
come in with this goofy joe down ski
 

185
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,830

197
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,350

if you know how again stride you know

198
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
if you know how again stride you know
 

199
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,150
