350
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560

hit the window. The window is not moving

your weapon selection is going to be

358
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
your weapon selection is going to be
 

359
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,030
your weapon selection is going to be
dependent upon hopefully I can set it up

360
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
dependent upon hopefully I can set it up
 

361
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,389
dependent upon hopefully I can set it up
just right. But if I can't then you

362
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
just right. But if I can't then you
 

363
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,990
just right. But if I can't then you
can't use that weapon anymore and that

364
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
can't use that weapon anymore and that
 

365
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,990
can't use that weapon anymore and that
weapon's going to jack you up. Your

366
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
weapon's going to jack you up. Your
 

367
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,069

weapon selection is ultimately what's my

368
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
weapon selection is ultimately what's my
 

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,069
