00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,509

this one

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
this one
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,669
this one
isn't quite so important what side you

this is done in the tajitsu movement

20
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
this is done in the tajitsu movement
 

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,069
this is done in the tajitsu movement
many times when you're

22
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
many times when you're
 

23
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,510
many times when you're
going in

24
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520

 

25
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,470

if they come with a showman you can

26
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
if they come with a showman you can
 

27
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,470
if they come with a showman you can
deflect it

28
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
deflect it
 

29
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,110
deflect it
slightly go past their neck and do a

30
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
slightly go past their neck and do a
 

31
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,350
slightly go past their neck and do a
faster room and eggy

32
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
faster room and eggy
 

33
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,310
faster room and eggy
so

34
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
so
 

35
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,830
so
we

36
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
we
 

37
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,470
we
tied it tight

38
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480

 

39
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,950

tied it through

40
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960

 

41
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,750

i did see

42
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760

 

43
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,270

many people don't realize this

44
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
many people don't realize this
 

45
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,030
many people don't realize this
but the catego

46
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040

 

47
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,830

we

48
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
we
 

49
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,830
we
go this side

50
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840

 

51
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,310

many people just think that it's a the

52
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
many people just think that it's a the
 

53
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,429
many people just think that it's a the

54
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
is the longest uh flailing strike with a
 

55
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,390
is the longest uh flailing strike with a
joe

56
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
joe
 

57
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,149
joe
gives you the biggest distance of all

58
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
gives you the biggest distance of all
 

59
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,310
gives you the biggest distance of all
the all the movements

60
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
the all the movements
 

61
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,910
the all the movements
a lot of people do this i'll show you

62
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
a lot of people do this i'll show you
 

63
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:59,030
a lot of people do this i'll show you
from the back

64
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040

 

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,630

if you don't like that it's wrong

66
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
if you don't like that it's wrong
 

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,670
if you don't like that it's wrong
because

68
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
because
 

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,429
because
you're just resting it

70
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
you're just resting it
 

71
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,789
you're just resting it
ready to

72
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
ready to
 

73
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,310
ready to
do the front part

74
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
do the front part
 

75
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,229
do the front part
the idea is that you're supposed to be

76
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
the idea is that you're supposed to be
 

77
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,070
the idea is that you're supposed to be
protecting your back

78
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
protecting your back
 

79
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,790
protecting your back
so

80
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so
 

81
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,830
so
because i could die from multiple attack

82
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840

 

83
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,030

i'm

84
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,550

what the things we have the things we

90
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
what the things we have the things we
 

91
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,190
what the things we have the things we
have to do you could if you're in a

92
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
have to do you could if you're in a
 

93
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,949
have to do you could if you're in a
certain situation go on this side

94
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
certain situation go on this side
 

95
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,470
certain situation go on this side
you see as long as you're protecting

96
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
you see as long as you're protecting
 

97
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,070

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040

 

101
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,509

the next part like all aikido should

102
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
the next part like all aikido should
 

103
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,589
the next part like all aikido should
come from the hips

104
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
come from the hips
 

105
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,589
come from the hips
the hips the pelvis

106
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
the hips the pelvis
 

107
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,949
the hips the pelvis
not the arms

108
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959

 

109
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,910

so now

110
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920

 

111
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,470

i move forward

112
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
i move forward
 

113
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,990
i move forward
and i turn

114
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000

 

115
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,630

turn

116
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640

 

117
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,869

your aim is to keep doing that as a warm

118
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
your aim is to keep doing that as a warm
 

119

make sure that you maximize your your
spinal twist

124
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
spinal twist
 

125
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,990
spinal twist
quit allowing the power to release the

126
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
quit allowing the power to release the
 

127
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,869
quit allowing the power to release the
joe

128
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
joe
 

129
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:36,710
joe
not the arms

130
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720

 

131
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,550

then it releases it

132
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560

 

133
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,190

this

148
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
this
 

149
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,429
this

158
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
to be straight not cocked
 

159
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,310
to be straight not cocked

on the last part

176
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
