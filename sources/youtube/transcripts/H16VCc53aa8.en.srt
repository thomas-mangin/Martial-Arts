into his center
when you go into his center you attack

100
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
when you go into his center you attack
 

101
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,149
when you go into his center you attack

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
got it so
 

107
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,830
got it so
this would not be a dead

108

109
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,149

that's finding the arrow

110

that's finding the arrow
 

111
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,070
that's finding the arrow
and then bypassing hands and center

00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
it's going to repeat patterns in the
 

121
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,110
it's going to repeat patterns in the
universe

122
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
universe
 

123
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,070
universe
so you're going to come up

124
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
so you're going to come up
 

125
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,110
so you're going to come up
and not move this out of the way

126
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120

 

127
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,430

it's going to come up

128
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
it's going to come up
 

129
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,030
it's going to come up
and i'm going to go around it

130
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040

 

131
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,229

here

132
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239

 

133
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,710

so i'm not an alternate universe where i

134
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
so i'm not an alternate universe where i
 

135
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,149
so i'm not an alternate universe where i
come over here

136
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
come over here
 

137
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,750
come over here
around the weapon

138
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
around the weapon
 

139
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,070
around the weapon
and i'm not clashing with the weapon

140
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080

 

141
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,429

so the first move comes up

142
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
so the first move comes up
 

143
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,869
so the first move comes up
and then begins around it

144
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879

 

145
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,869

making this different

146
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879

 

147
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,110

and making this different

148
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120

 

149
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,229

you're going to see it come up

00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
you're going to see it come up
 

151
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,469
you're going to see it come up
and go around it

152
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479

 

153
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,390

this way i already made connection with

154
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
this way i already made connection with
 

155
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,990
this way i already made connection with
the weapon and now whatever camry does

156
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
the weapon and now whatever camry does
 

157
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,390
the weapon and now whatever camry does
right i can stay connected to the weapon

158
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
right i can stay connected to the weapon
 

159
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,030
right i can stay connected to the weapon
over here it leads to aiuchi

160
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040

 

161
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,550

right

162
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
right
 

163
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,469
right
and this doesn't do what you think it's

164
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
and this doesn't do what you think it's
 

165
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,830
and this doesn't do what you think it's
going to do it just pushes his sword

00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
so he's going to do it his hearts
 

357
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,630
so he's going to do it his hearts
i kind of look okay then you go well it

360
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
wasn't deep enough
 

361
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,190

you were you were standing at the edge

362
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
you were you were standing at the edge
 

363
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,710

okay so here

366
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399

 

367
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,790

let's watch actually go rewind it and

368
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
let's watch actually go rewind it and
 

369
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,550
let's watch actually go rewind it and
zoom do

370
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560

 

371
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,070

okay

372
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
okay
 

373
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,870
okay
what is going on

374
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
what is going on
 

375
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,030
what is going on
well again if you look at

376
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
well again if you look at
 

377
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,990
well again if you look at
bayonet fighting

378
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
bayonet fighting
 

379
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,550

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
they're not like this
 

381
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,269
they're not like this
it's in your body

you don't throw the weapon

388
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
you don't throw the weapon
 

389
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,870
you don't throw the weapon
you don't throw the weapon

390
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
you don't throw the weapon
 

391
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,269
you don't throw the weapon
you hold it to your body

392
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
you hold it to your body
 

393
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,790
you hold it to your body
and your body moves

394
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800

 

395
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,350

you see that my body moves

396
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360

 

397
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,310

that

398
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
that
 

399
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,310
that
part comes

400
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
part comes
 

401
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,190
part comes
after the inertia is taken and he's gone

402
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
after the inertia is taken and he's gone
 

403
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,910
after the inertia is taken and he's gone
that way

404
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920

 

405
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960

so it can't be

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,069
it's gonna hit

boom and
 

421
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,710
boom and
then in okay

and you can
do that kind of stuff okay

do that kind of stuff okay
 

435

i will show it

442
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
i will show it
 

443
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,550
i will show it
i want you to watch the timing when i

444
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
i want you to watch the timing when i
 

445
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,990
i want you to watch the timing when i
make contact

446
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
make contact
 

447
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,550
make contact
it's in this position when i first touch

448
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
it's in this position when i first touch
 

449
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,750
it's in this position when i first touch
his body

450
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
his body
 

451
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,630
his body
okay

452
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
okay
 

453
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,790
okay
it's not in this position when i touch

454
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
it's not in this position when i touch
 

455
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,190
it's not in this position when i touch
his body okay so i'm going to do the

456
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
his body okay so i'm going to do the
 

457
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,509
his body okay so i'm going to do the
technique

458
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
technique
 

459
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,710
technique
you see and that is what would roll over

460
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
you see and that is what would roll over
 

461
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,630
you see and that is what would roll over
got it okay

462
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
got it okay
 

463
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,389
got it okay
let's try the whole thing now

464
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399

 

465
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,110

so

466
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
so
 

467
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:19,430
so
moving on a little too cute guys

468
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440

 

469
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,190

i'm doing the same thing

470
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
i'm doing the same thing
 

471
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,389
i'm doing the same thing
so where he felt that attack on his

472
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
so where he felt that attack on his
 

473
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,509
so where he felt that attack on his
hands is he did the rotating cross back

474
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
hands is he did the rotating cross back
 

475
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,590
hands is he did the rotating cross back
to me so i'll show you okay but we're

476
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
to me so i'll show you okay but we're
 

477
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,590
to me so i'll show you okay but we're
going to go slow there's the

478
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
going to go slow there's the
 

479
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,829
going to go slow there's the
beginning of the rotating cross

480
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
beginning of the rotating cross
 

481
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,110
beginning of the rotating cross
and he wait he's going to feel the drop

482
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
and he wait he's going to feel the drop
 

483
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,150
and he wait he's going to feel the drop
that's why he rotates across again and

484
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
that's why he rotates across again and
 

485
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,470
that's why he rotates across again and
this drops into empty space

486
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
this drops into empty space
 

487
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,470
this drops into empty space
see that

488
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
see that
 

489
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,470
see that
so he's not letting this

490
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
so he's not letting this
 

491
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,790
so he's not letting this
i'm not doing that

492
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
i'm not doing that
 

493
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,150
i'm not doing that
but he's not going early either

494
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
but he's not going early either
 

495
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,030
but he's not going early either
he is reconciling the dong energy with

496
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
he is reconciling the dong energy with
 

497
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,350
he is reconciling the dong energy with
the same rotating cross

498
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360

 

499
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,990

that means his sword will hit me

500
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
that means his sword will hit me
 

501
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,069
that means his sword will hit me
in the middle of my technique and he's

502
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
in the middle of my technique and he's
 

503
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,150
in the middle of my technique and he's
got a chance now as opposed to i go

504
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
got a chance now as opposed to i go
 

505
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,550
got a chance now as opposed to i go
no that's never gonna get that off okay

506
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
no that's never gonna get that off okay
 

507
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,110
no that's never gonna get that off okay
so again another marshall rule we

508
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
so again another marshall rule we
 

509
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,949
so again another marshall rule we
already did one hit the thing that's

510
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
already did one hit the thing that's
 

511
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,269
already did one hit the thing that's
next to you we did two fight the archer

512
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
next to you we did two fight the archer
 

513
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,150
next to you we did two fight the archer
not the arrow and now three

514
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
not the arrow and now three
 

515
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,870
not the arrow and now three
his counter must be in the midst of my

516
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
his counter must be in the midst of my
 

517
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,910
his counter must be in the midst of my
attack otherwise it does not work okay

518
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
attack otherwise it does not work okay
 

519
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,629
attack otherwise it does not work okay
so he has to wait boom that's what he

520
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
so he has to wait boom that's what he
 

521
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:44,150
so he has to wait boom that's what he
gets

522
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160

 

523
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,430

all right let's try okay

524
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440

 

525
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,230

okay so i'm going to feel that i'm going

526
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
okay so i'm going to feel that i'm going
 

527
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,829
okay so i'm going to feel that i'm going
to feel that

528
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
to feel that
 

529
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,430
to feel that
you're going to feel the void do you see

530
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
you're going to feel the void do you see
