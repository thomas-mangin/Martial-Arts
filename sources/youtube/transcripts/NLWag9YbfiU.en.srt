00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,550

one more

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,560

 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:22,630

10 all right

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640

 

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,390

let's all

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400

 

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,790

right for simp licity sake let's divide

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
right for simp licity sake let's divide
 

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,150
right for simp licity sake let's divide
up uh two different types of engines you

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
up uh two different types of engines you
 

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,590
up uh two different types of engines you
have leverage engin so i' have a fulcrum

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
have leverage engin so i' have a fulcrum
 

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,229
have leverage engin so i' have a fulcrum
here at his elbow and then a lever at

14
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
here at his elbow and then a lever at
 

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,549
here at his elbow and then a lever at
his wrist okay and I push and

16
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,990

pull and it works it generates energy to

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
pull and it works it generates energy to
 

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,189
pull and it works it generates energy to
overcome resistance either in the shape

20
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:52,199
overcome resistance either in the shape
 

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,110
overcome resistance either in the shape
of this mass or in the in the his

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
of this mass or in the in the his
 

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,270
of this mass or in the in the his
counter his Marshall counter it works

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,280
counter his Marshall counter it works
 

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,069
counter his Marshall counter it works
okay uh that's one one type of engine

26
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,079
okay uh that's one one type of engine
 

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,150
okay uh that's one one type of engine
I'm going to say that's an external

28
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm going to say that's an external
 

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,070
I'm going to say that's an external
material engine okay another type of

30
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,080
material engine okay another type of
 

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,190
material engine okay another type of
engine

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200
engine
 

33
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,510
engine
is uh let's say he has uh momentum and

34
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
is uh let's say he has uh momentum and
 

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,190
is uh let's say he has uh momentum and
inertia going this way so you don't lean

36
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,200
inertia going this way so you don't lean
 

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,789
inertia going this way so you don't lean
or anything just Chico that way there

38
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
or anything just Chico that way there
 

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,910
or anything just Chico that way there
you go and his arms going forward okay

40
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920
you go and his arms going forward okay
 

41
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,870
you go and his arms going forward okay
so his arms going forward go ahead and

42
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:25,880
so his arms going forward go ahead and
 

43
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,390
so his arms going forward go ahead and
I'm going to take it over here utilizing

44
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm going to take it over here utilizing
 

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,310
I'm going to take it over here utilizing
that energy and inertia and even without

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
that energy and inertia and even without
 

47
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,510
that energy and inertia and even without
the

48
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
the
 

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,190
the
elbow you get the same result okay I am

50
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,200
elbow you get the same result okay I am
 

51
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,630
elbow you get the same result okay I am
going to for Simplicity sake call that

52
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
going to for Simplicity sake call that
 

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,230
going to for Simplicity sake call that
an energetic engine I am not implying

54
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
an energetic engine I am not implying
 

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,709
an energetic engine I am not implying
there's no energy in the fcum lever but

56
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719
there's no energy in the fcum lever but
 

57
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,389
there's no energy in the fcum lever but
it is not functioning through a fulcrum

58
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
it is not functioning through a fulcrum
 

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,030
it is not functioning through a fulcrum
lever okay and it's not really

60
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
lever okay and it's not really
 

61
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,590
lever okay and it's not really
functioning um materially either because

62
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
functioning um materially either because
 

63
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,429
functioning um materially either because
I'm controlling the elbow

64
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:00,439
I'm controlling the elbow
 

65
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,069
I'm controlling the elbow
by allowing the energy the inertia and

66
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079
by allowing the energy the inertia and
 

67
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,830
by allowing the energy the inertia and
the momentum to go forward I don't need

68
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
the momentum to go forward I don't need
 

69
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,350
the momentum to go forward I don't need
a fol on the elbow okay

70
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,360
a fol on the elbow okay
 

71
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,470
a fol on the elbow okay
so as he's going forward I could put

72
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,480
so as he's going forward I could put
 

73
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,470
so as he's going forward I could put
that on the elbow but I'm not cranking

74
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
that on the elbow but I'm not cranking
 

75
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,670
that on the elbow but I'm not cranking
it so like for example uh EO he pushes

76
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:18,680
it so like for example uh EO he pushes
 

77
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,430
it so like for example uh EO he pushes
EO Ur looks like that too but I'm not

78
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
EO Ur looks like that too but I'm not
 

79
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,150
EO Ur looks like that too but I'm not
shoving that down you can have where

80
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,160
shoving that down you can have where
 

81
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,990
shoving that down you can have where
you're here and you're just doing fulam

82
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
you're here and you're just doing fulam
 

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,830
you're here and you're just doing fulam
lever stuff okay

84
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840

 

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,550

let's go to ad nag so let's have you be

86
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:35,560
let's go to ad nag so let's have you be
 

87
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,990
let's go to ad nag so let's have you be
over here facing the other way come over

88
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
over here facing the other way come over
 

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,390
over here facing the other way come over
here it's right

90
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400

 

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,750

there and you're going to do the

92
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
there and you're going to do the
 

93
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,869
there and you're going to do the
kazushi you can use basically a

94
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:49,879
kazushi you can use basically a
 

95
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,949
kazushi you can use basically a
mechanical fulum lever engine here I

96
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
mechanical fulum lever engine here I
 

97
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,110

want you just to slowly travel that way

128
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
want you just to slowly travel that way
 

129
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,030
want you just to slowly travel that way
and shico let me see do it first slowly

130
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,040
and shico let me see do it first slowly
 

131
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,470
and shico let me see do it first slowly
travel that way and she

132
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480

 

133
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,670

okay is I hold he slowly

134
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
okay is I hold he slowly
 

135
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,229
okay is I hold he slowly
goes

136
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
goes
 

137
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,509
goes
and because he's going that

138
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519
and because he's going that
 

139
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,390
and because he's going that
way eventually his feet move forward of

140
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,400
way eventually his feet move forward of
 

141
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,589
way eventually his feet move forward of
his head and he falls the same way so in

142
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:08,599
his head and he falls the same way so in
 

143
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,630
his head and he falls the same way so in
the fulcrum engine lever his feet stayed

144
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
the fulcrum engine lever his feet stayed
 

145
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,830
the fulcrum engine lever his feet stayed
still because that's my fulcrum and I

146
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
still because that's my fulcrum and I
 

147
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,550
still because that's my fulcrum and I
pulled his head this way in the

148
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:17,560
pulled his head this way in the
 

149
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,469
pulled his head this way in the
energetic engine I had his feet go

150
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:21,479
energetic engine I had his feet go
 

151
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,230
energetic engine I had his feet go
forward and I kept his head

152
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,240

 

153
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,670

still in this engine there's some

154
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
still in this engine there's some
 

155
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,950
still in this engine there's some
benefits to this okay in this fulcrum

156
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
benefits to this okay in this fulcrum
 

157
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,070
benefits to this okay in this fulcrum

169
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,790
lever to move X size of Boulder if
you're trying to pry it okay so if he's

170
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
you're trying to pry it okay so if he's
 

171
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,590
you're trying to pry it okay so if he's
really strong he's going that way and

172
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
really strong he's going that way and
 

173
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,110
really strong he's going that way and
I'm he's moving me now not the other way

174
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm he's moving me now not the other way
 

175
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,350
I'm he's moving me now not the other way
around

176
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360

 

177
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,909

okay you will be more efficient if you

178
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:06,919
okay you will be more efficient if you
 

179
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,830
okay you will be more efficient if you
just hold the head still cuz I'm not

180
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
just hold the head still cuz I'm not
 

181
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,629
just hold the head still cuz I'm not
trying to move the head I hold the head

trying to move the head I hold the head
 

183
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,230
trying to move the head I hold the head
still and then he moves so I'm only

184
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
still and then he moves so I'm only
 

185
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,390
still and then he moves so I'm only
moving a quarter a corner of it it'll

186
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,400
moving a quarter a corner of it it'll
 

187
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,430
moving a quarter a corner of it it'll
take

disadvantage of these pulling techniques
 

195
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,189
disadvantage of these pulling techniques
is that nothing actually turns the

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
I pull back he he would just rock like
 

205
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,110

so now what I'm going to

214
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:06,199
so now what I'm going to
 

215
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,870
so now what I'm going to
do go slow he's going to go forward and

216
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
do go slow he's going to go forward and

deviation okay stay right
 

227
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,309
deviation okay stay right
there and then I would move again in my

228
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
there and then I would move again in my
 

229
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,270
there and then I would move again in my
own ASI VY you see and he would keep

230
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
own ASI VY you see and he would keep
 

231
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,270
own ASI VY you see and he would keep
moving forward and it got more you see

232
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
moving forward and it got more you see
 

233
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,670
moving forward and it got more you see
you fell a little past it there you go

234
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
you fell a little past it there you go
 

235
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,029
you fell a little past it there you go
and I would turn

236
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:44,039
and I would turn
 

237
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,870
and I would turn
again and he would move forward

238
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
again and he would move forward
 

239
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,029
again and he would move forward
more and you get more rotation do you

240
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
more and you get more rotation do you
 

241
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,790
more and you get more rotation do you
see and you would turn again and he'd be

242
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
see and you would turn again and he'd be
 

243
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,510
see and you would turn again and he'd be
going forward more and then you got the

244
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
going forward more and then you got the
 

245
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,629
going forward more and then you got the
full

so we'll go
 

253
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,070
so we'll go
here face me and we doing katori I'm

bring him
 

257
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,390
bring him
around I come around not to pull him but

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
around I come around not to pull him but
 

259
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,270
around I come around not to pull him but
just to stop the head as he's going

260
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
just to stop the head as he's going
 

261
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,790
just to stop the head as he's going
forward and keep my rotation going and

okay so that was a explanation of the

314
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,560
okay so that was a explanation of the
 

315
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,190
okay so that was a explanation of the
engine that you're using and the engine

316
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
engine that you're using and the engine
 

317
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,990
engine that you're using and the engine
you're not using now you start asking

318
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,000
you're not using now you start asking
 

319
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,550
you're not using now you start asking
and answering well how did you get the

320
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
and answering well how did you get the
 

321
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,829
and answering well how did you get the
engine in place okay um well the first

322
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
engine in place okay um well the first
 

323
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,509
engine in place okay um well the first
thing is it has to be done

324
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:24,519
thing is it has to be done
 

325
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,630
thing is it has to be done
internally so the first internal engine

326
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:27,640
internally so the first internal engine
 

327
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,949
internally so the first internal engine
that you have let's face the other way

328
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
that you have let's face the other way
 

329
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,630
that you have let's face the other way
cuz the camera's on the other side face

330
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
cuz the camera's on the other side face
 

331
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,230
cuz the camera's on the other side face
that way okay the first one is your

332
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,240
that way okay the first one is your
 

333
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,230
that way okay the first one is your
adhesion here so you're not grabbing it

334
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
adhesion here so you're not grabbing it
 

335
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,310
adhesion here so you're not grabbing it
you're not doing a buul and mind meld

336
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
you're not doing a buul and mind meld

you're not fish hooking him you're not
 

339
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,710
you're not fish hooking him you're not
grabbing the collar okay you're just

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
grabbing the collar okay you're just
 

341
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,870
grabbing the collar okay you're just
here this is your adhesion and you are

342
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
here this is your adhesion and you are
 

343
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,870
here this is your adhesion and you are
matching his young energy when you match

344
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:53,880
matching his young energy when you match
 

345
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,230
matching his young energy when you match
his y energy which is generated here in

00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,240
his y energy which is generated here in
 

347
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,150
his y energy which is generated here in
this case uh the grav gravitational pull

348
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
this case uh the grav gravitational pull
 

349
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,630
this case uh the grav gravitational pull
on his Mass uh his inertia and momentum

350
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
on his Mass uh his inertia and momentum
 

351
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,509
on his Mass uh his inertia and momentum
which is going straight uh so that means

352
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
which is going straight uh so that means
 

353
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,990
which is going straight uh so that means
laterally there's a Yang energy stopping

354
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
laterally there's a Yang energy stopping
 

355
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,829
laterally there's a Yang energy stopping
the lateral there and I I have to match

356
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:12,839
the lateral there and I I have to match
 

357
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,990
the lateral there and I I have to match
the Yang energy and when I match the Y

the Yang energy and when I match the Y
 

359
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,910

the the matches y energy and then what
 

363
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,790
the the matches y energy and then what
happens iy happens and then this gets

364
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:25,800
happens iy happens and then this gets
 

365
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,350

stuck so if I'm loose and he goes

366
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,360
stuck so if I'm loose and he goes
 

367
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,350
stuck so if I'm loose and he goes
forward he just slips off and if I'm

368
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
forward he just slips off and if I'm
 

369
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,030
forward he just slips off and if I'm
hard like this he slips off again too

370
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
hard like this he slips off again too
 

371
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,790

but if I'm just matching his you get you

372
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:37,800
but if I'm just matching his you get you
 

373
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,590
but if I'm just matching his you get you
feel it there's a little stuckness I

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:40,600
feel it there's a little stuckness I
 

375
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,949
feel it there's a little stuckness I
open my fingers so you could see it it's

376
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
open my fingers so you could see it it's
 

377
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,069
open my fingers so you could see it it's
energetic it's not anatomical so

378
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
energetic it's not anatomical so
 

379
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,550

what I'm

384
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,600
what I'm
 

385
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,389
what I'm
doing once you have

386
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:57,399
doing once you have
 

387
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,150
doing once you have
that because you have inertia and

388
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,160
that because you have inertia and
 

389
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,750
that because you have inertia and
momentum working

390
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760

falling the Yang value goes
 

395
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,870
falling the Yang value goes
up which means at the I adhesion there's

396
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:13,880
up which means at the I adhesion there's
 

397
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,430
up which means at the I adhesion there's
a lot of energy there's way more

398
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,440
a lot of energy there's way more
 

399
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,269
a lot of energy there's way more
friction than even here just standing

the inverse of what most people think is
 

411
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,710
the inverse of what most people think is
like it gets easier to do the internal

412
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:35,720
like it gets easier to do the internal
 

413
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,350
like it gets easier to do the internal
at the higher energetic levels okay so

414
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
at the higher energetic levels okay so
 

415
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,750
at the higher energetic levels okay so
you have to start with that adhesion but

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
you have to start with that adhesion but
