if i speed it up
 

11
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,270
if i speed it up
it's not going to be good okay

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280

 

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,350

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,950

your

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
your
 

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,430
your

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
on limb
 

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,470
on limb
strength

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
strength
 

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,070
strength
that's resistant

24
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
that's resistant
 

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,510

your chemi is on center expansion

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
your chemi is on center expansion
 

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,870
your chemi is on center expansion
okay

28
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880

 

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,510

and

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520

 

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,590

you're coming in and you're moving the

32
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
you're coming in and you're moving the
 

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,070
you're coming in and you're moving the
center so this is kind of just giving

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
center so this is kind of just giving
 

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,429
center so this is kind of just giving
you one little opening the elbow is now

36
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
you one little opening the elbow is now
 

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,109
you one little opening the elbow is now
more effective in moving the center

38
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
more effective in moving the center
 

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,590
more effective in moving the center
directly that's taking the other one but

40
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
directly that's taking the other one but
 

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,789
directly that's taking the other one but
you don't want to make it an arm

42
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
you don't want to make it an arm
 

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,030
you don't want to make it an arm
technique you created a

44
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
technique you created a
 

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,390
technique you created a
movement now for the body to be directly

46
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
movement now for the body to be directly
 

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,270
movement now for the body to be directly
influenced so don't travel and make this

48
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
influenced so don't travel and make this
 

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,870
influenced so don't travel and make this
arm geometry a leverage technique

50
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
arm geometry a leverage technique
 

51
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,469
arm geometry a leverage technique
you want to think of it more as a hip

52
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
you want to think of it more as a hip
 

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,950
you want to think of it more as a hip
room

54
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960

 

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,310

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
okay
 

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,069
okay
so

58
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079

 

59
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,149

slide opening

60
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
slide opening
 

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,789
slide opening
continuing the opening on the elbow and

62
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
continuing the opening on the elbow and
 

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,550
continuing the opening on the elbow and
once you have it you're moving in

64
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
once you have it you're moving in
 

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:13,750
once you have it you're moving in
through the center

66
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760

 

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:34,830

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,869

okay so you find the archer not the

70
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
okay so you find the archer not the
 

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,150

if i'm going into the center i'm not
 

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,990

so the same thing
 

107
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,149
so the same thing
if she tries to prioritize she's got the

00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
if she tries to prioritize she's got the
 

109
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,270
if she tries to prioritize she's got the
body here and now let's say she goes to

110
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
body here and now let's say she goes to
 

111
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,070
body here and now let's say she goes to

boom
in bring your foot in to see if it's

184
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
in bring your foot in to see if it's
 

185
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,990
in bring your foot in to see if it's
mushy and i can keep attacking when it's

186
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
mushy and i can keep attacking when it's
 

187
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:33,909
mushy and i can keep attacking when it's
not mushy then i go around it

188
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919

 

189
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,790

so my pattern is

190
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
so my pattern is
 

191
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,749
so my pattern is
in

192
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
in
 

193
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,430
in
continue in i feel oh obstacle did i go

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
continue in i feel oh obstacle did i go
 

195
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,790
continue in i feel oh obstacle did i go
around it

196
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
around it
 

197
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,150
around it
down i go

i'm just doing whatever he's doing so
 

229
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,309
i'm just doing whatever he's doing so
let's do that he saw me through a little

230
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
let's do that he saw me through a little
 

231
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,830
let's do that he saw me through a little
step right

232
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
step right
 

233
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,150
step right
because he only took about four inches

234
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
because he only took about four inches
 

235
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,670
because he only took about four inches
of entry put your foot back

236
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
of entry put your foot back
 

237
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,670
of entry put your foot back
if he answers that much

238
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
if he answers that much
 

239
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,990
if he answers that much
he's not going to push me over that leg

240
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
he's not going to push me over that leg
 

241
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,150
he's not going to push me over that leg
so he just i'm just doing what he's

242
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
so he just i'm just doing what he's
 

243
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,870
so he just i'm just doing what he's
doing push

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880

 

245
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,309

he got a little

246
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
he got a little
 

247
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,950
he got a little
okay but not all my center right of

248
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
okay but not all my center right of
 

249
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,270
okay but not all my center right of
course i can bring my leg back in but

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
course i can bring my leg back in but
 

251
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,350
course i can bring my leg back in but
he's not not here to

252
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
he's not not here to
 

253
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,550
he's not not here to
subvert everything he's doing okay

254
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
subvert everything he's doing okay
 

255
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,390
subvert everything he's doing okay
so he's going out a little bit so you

256
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
so he's going out a little bit so you
 

257
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,390
so he's going out a little bit so you
see my center didn't move all i did was

258
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
see my center didn't move all i did was
 

259
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,550
see my center didn't move all i did was
move my arm right right so that's all i

260
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
move my arm right right so that's all i
 

261
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,589
move my arm right right so that's all i
do he goes

262
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599

 

263
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:39,909

you gotta figure out how to move me

264
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919

 

265
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,309

a little bigger

266
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
a little bigger
 

267
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,430
a little bigger
a little better

268
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
a little better
 

269
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,430
a little better
it's not this or

270
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
it's not this or
 

271
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,670
it's not this or
or this

272
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
or this
 

273
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,790
or this
okay

274
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
okay
 

275
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,430
okay
let them learn

276
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440

 

277
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:08,629

there i'm going to get my body to move

278
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639

 

279
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,550

all right so

280
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
all right so
 

281
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,430
all right so
that angle doesn't work right

282
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
that angle doesn't work right
 

283
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,550
that angle doesn't work right
why don't you watch i'm gonna help you

284
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
why don't you watch i'm gonna help you
 

285
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,710
why don't you watch i'm gonna help you
why don't you stop

286
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
why don't you stop
 

287
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:33,750
why don't you stop
why don't you roll this this way

288
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760

 

289
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,430

your safe situation waiting for your

290
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
your safe situation waiting for your
 

291
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,029
your safe situation waiting for your
show

292
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
show
 

293
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:52,150
show
nope forward

294
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160

 

295
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,829

now you're coming in and what you're

296
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
now you're coming in and what you're
 

297
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,430
now you're coming in and what you're
going to end up doing

298
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
going to end up doing
 

299
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,430
going to end up doing
is you're going to push

300
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
is you're going to push
 

301
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,509
is you're going to push
go ahead and position that okay so i

302
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
go ahead and position that okay so i
 

303
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,750
go ahead and position that okay so i
would have the arm right just position

304
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
would have the arm right just position
 

305
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,070
would have the arm right just position
that and the leg is up

306
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
that and the leg is up
 

307
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,470
that and the leg is up
okay and all you're going to do is push

308
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
okay and all you're going to do is push
 

309
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,990
okay and all you're going to do is push
this over and all they have to do is hop

310
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000

 

311
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,829

back in that position

312
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
back in that position
 

313
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,070
back in that position
what you want to do instead

314
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
what you want to do instead
 

315
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,509
what you want to do instead
is that go to topsy-turvy effect that we

316
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
is that go to topsy-turvy effect that we
 

317
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,910
is that go to topsy-turvy effect that we
always do so it's the same geometry of

318
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
always do so it's the same geometry of
 

319
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,910
always do so it's the same geometry of
the forward roll she has to be on the

320
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
the forward roll she has to be on the
 

321
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,790
the forward roll she has to be on the
diagonal and the feet have to travel

322
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
diagonal and the feet have to travel
 

323
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,590
diagonal and the feet have to travel
in

324
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
in
 

325
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,070
in
contrast to the head on that diagonal

326
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
contrast to the head on that diagonal
 

327
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,269
contrast to the head on that diagonal
okay

328
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
okay
 

329
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,030
okay
so if you look at when she does a

330
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
so if you look at when she does a
 

331
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,630
so if you look at when she does a
forward roll this hip can't be down

332
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
forward roll this hip can't be down
 

333
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,750
forward roll this hip can't be down
this tip

334
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
this tip
 

335
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,670
this tip
to follow that same path i just did with

336
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
to follow that same path i just did with
 

337
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,230
to follow that same path i just did with
the head and feet this tip has to go

338
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
the head and feet this tip has to go
 

339
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,990
the head and feet this tip has to go
around that way

340
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
around that way
 

341
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,310
around that way
you understand so if i do the arm bar

342
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
you understand so if i do the arm bar
 

343
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,710
you understand so if i do the arm bar
look i put that hip down

344
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
look i put that hip down
 

345
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,110
look i put that hip down
you see and now i just have arm control

346
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
you see and now i just have arm control
 

347
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,630
you see and now i just have arm control
that's all i have and if you're strong

348
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
that's all i have and if you're strong
 

349
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,630
that's all i have and if you're strong
enough and if they don't mind lying down

350
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
enough and if they don't mind lying down
 

351
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,630
enough and if they don't mind lying down
for you it works but you shouldn't train

352
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
for you it works but you shouldn't train
 

353
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,389
for you it works but you shouldn't train
for people that you're stronger and

354

for people that you're stronger and
 

355
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,550
for people that you're stronger and
people who don't mind you

right
 

359
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,110
right
so what you have to do is you have to

360
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
so what you have to do is you have to
 

361
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,829
so what you have to do is you have to
leave that hip open

362
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
leave that hip open
 

363
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,990
leave that hip open
you have to get your hip in there

364
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
you have to get your hip in there
 

365
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,430
you have to get your hip in there
before

366
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
before
 

367
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,710
before
it closes

368
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
it closes
 

369
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,150
it closes
okay

370
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
okay
 

371
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,230
okay
if you exaggerate it

372
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
if you exaggerate it
 

373
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,990
if you exaggerate it
and we'll close that hip all the way

374
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
and we'll close that hip all the way
 

375
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,069
and we'll close that hip all the way
with a step forward

376
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
with a step forward
 

377
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,750
with a step forward
that hips closed all the way do you see

378
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
that hips closed all the way do you see
 

379
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,509
that hips closed all the way do you see
that that is the

380
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
that that is the
 

381
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,710
that that is the
opening

382
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
opening
 

383
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,030
opening
you don't do a motif

384
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
you don't do a motif
 

385
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,110
you don't do a motif
when that foot goes forward because the

386
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
when that foot goes forward because the
 

387
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,670
when that foot goes forward because the
hips closed all the way

388
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
hips closed all the way
 

389
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,310
hips closed all the way
and if you find that you close that hip

390
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
and if you find that you close that hip
 

391
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,509
and if you find that you close that hip
all the way

392
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
all the way
 

393
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,230
all the way
here you should do

394
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
here you should do
 

395
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,350
here you should do
an ura

396
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360

403
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,269
is you're fighting the arrow and not the
archer so that hip cannot be closed

404
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279

 

405
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,269

that means don't push this arm so far

406
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
that means don't push this arm so far
 

407
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,870
that means don't push this arm so far
forward

408

i'm positioning her
on my hip

416
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
on my hip
 

417
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,550
on my hip
and then i use the arm

418
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
and then i use the arm
 

419
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,110
and then i use the arm
to do what i was doing with that push of

420

her head and foot
 

423
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,110
her head and foot
that creates

424
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
that creates
 

425
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,069
that creates
the topsy-turvy effect

426
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
the topsy-turvy effect
 

427
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,870
the topsy-turvy effect
that gives her me the opening

that gives her me the opening
pool onto her center

430
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760

 

431
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,870

versus fighting her chasing her down

432
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
versus fighting her chasing her down
 

433
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,190
versus fighting her chasing her down
this way at an angle

434
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200

 

435
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,790

let's just make a kind of

446
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
let's just make a kind of
 

447
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,670
let's just make a kind of
tactical

448
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
tactical
 

449
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,550
tactical
capturing of time and space

450
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
capturing of time and space
 

451
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,629
capturing of time and space
and i could think i had a little i know

452
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
and i could think i had a little i know
 

453

anymore
so let's look at that

462
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
so let's look at that
 

463
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,389
so let's look at that
for one at a time like they can't attack

anymore
in that question

468
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
in that question
 

469
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,829
in that question
it doesn't seem to to

470
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,949
them okay so well
so so then in your reasoning there's an

530
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
so so then in your reasoning there's an
 

531
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,190
so so then in your reasoning there's an
assumption between that that's in place

532
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
assumption between that that's in place
 

533
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,110
assumption between that that's in place
i'm not saying it's wrong but there's an

534
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
i'm not saying it's wrong but there's an
 

535
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,870
i'm not saying it's wrong but there's an
assumption that

536
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
assumption that
 

537
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,509
assumption that
i do select one

538
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
i do select one
 

539
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,750
i do select one
means whether it be striking pain

540
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
means whether it be striking pain
 

541
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,670
means whether it be striking pain
choking etc

542
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
choking etc
 

543
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,750
choking etc
against another

544
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
against another
 

545
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,389
against another
because one is better suited

546
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
because one is better suited
 

547
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,550
because one is better suited
for whatever ends i want than the other

548
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
for whatever ends i want than the other
 

549
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,790
for whatever ends i want than the other
ones are and better suited we will just

550
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
ones are and better suited we will just
 

551
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,470
ones are and better suited we will just
for the sake of mouth

552
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
for the sake of mouth
 

553
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,189
for the sake of mouth
uh define it just more efficient

554
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
uh define it just more efficient
 

555
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,590
uh define it just more efficient
okay or more possible or a higher

556
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
okay or more possible or a higher
 

557
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,829
okay or more possible or a higher
percentage of achievement

558
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
percentage of achievement
 

559
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,550
percentage of achievement
okay are you fine with that all right so

560
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
okay are you fine with that all right so
 

561
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,189
okay are you fine with that all right so
why can't i throw them specifically what

562
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
why can't i throw them specifically what
 

563
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:08,069
why can't i throw them specifically what
is in the way of me throwing them

564
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079

 

565
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,990

do i not have to move them to pin them

566
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
do i not have to move them to pin them
 

567
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,509
do i not have to move them to pin them
so that's not it

568
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519

 

569
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,269

is it that they've presented a threat to

570
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
is it that they've presented a threat to
 

571
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,269
is it that they've presented a threat to
you that you have to address before you

572
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
you that you have to address before you
 

573
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,750
you that you have to address before you
came

574
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760

 

575
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,150

tonight you froze against presented to

576
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
tonight you froze against presented to
 

577
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:39,430
tonight you froze against presented to
me so that's not it

578
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440

 

579
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:56,230

is even closer and that's a throw

580
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240

 

581
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,069

well if you if you by doing the

582
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
well if you if you by doing the
 

583
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,550
well if you if you by doing the
technique okay and i come in here

584
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560

 

585
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,870

without a problem

586
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880

 

587
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,189

do you qualify that as a throw

588
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199

 

589
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,269

is it that maybe you tried to throw but

590
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
is it that maybe you tried to throw but
 

591
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,550
is it that maybe you tried to throw but
they were still

592
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
they were still
 

593
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,069
they were still
there so to speak they're still

594
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
there so to speak they're still
 

595
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,230
there so to speak they're still
connected to you

596
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
connected to you
 

597
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,829
connected to you
from i would say that's on the right

598
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
from i would say that's on the right
 

599
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,470
from i would say that's on the right
track okay

600
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
track okay
 

601
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,629
track okay
because i am attempting to throw

602
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
because i am attempting to throw
 

603
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,110
because i am attempting to throw
there's tactical advantages to throwing

604
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
there's tactical advantages to throwing
 

605
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,949
there's tactical advantages to throwing
over penny

606
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
over penny
 

607
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,629
over penny
right one is

608
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
right one is
 

609
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,310
right one is
i'm not close

610
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
i'm not close
 

611
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,030
i'm not close
i have to be close to be injured

612
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040

 

613
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,310

behind why we moved from sword fighting

614
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
behind why we moved from sword fighting
 

615
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,550
behind why we moved from sword fighting
to firearms you don't have to be close

616
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
to firearms you don't have to be close
 

617
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,110
to firearms you don't have to be close
anymore and why we go from firearms to

618
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
anymore and why we go from firearms to
 

619
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,670
anymore and why we go from firearms to
missiles yeah i can be far away and why

620
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
missiles yeah i can be far away and why
 

621
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,189
missiles yeah i can be far away and why
and why we go from

622
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
and why we go from
 

623
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,150
and why we go from
jet fighters to drones the pilot is even

624
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
jet fighters to drones the pilot is even
 

625
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,509
jet fighters to drones the pilot is even
further away

626
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
further away
 

627
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,389
further away
okay it's not even with the weapons

628
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
okay it's not even with the weapons
 

629
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,350
okay it's not even with the weapons
so i have to be close in order to be

630
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
so i have to be close in order to be
 

631
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,590
so i have to be close in order to be
injured so

632
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
injured so
 

633
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,590
injured so
tactically that would mean

634
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
tactically that would mean
 

635
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,230
tactically that would mean
throwing is a pretty good option

636
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
throwing is a pretty good option
 

637
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,910
throwing is a pretty good option
which would mean pinning has to come

638
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
which would mean pinning has to come
 

639
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
which would mean pinning has to come
after the fact

640
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
after the fact
 

641
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,269
after the fact
and if i think about a little bit it's

642
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
and if i think about a little bit it's
 

643
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,829
and if i think about a little bit it's
easier to pin somebody who's falling

644
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
easier to pin somebody who's falling
 

645
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,670
easier to pin somebody who's falling
than it is to force someone down from a

646
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
than it is to force someone down from a
 

647
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,829
than it is to force someone down from a
standing

648
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
standing
 

649
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,710
standing
position okay

650
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
position okay
 

651
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,710
position okay
and i also know from my trapping

652
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
and i also know from my trapping
 

653
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,509
and i also know from my trapping
training that it's hard as hell

654
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
training that it's hard as hell
 

655
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,430
training that it's hard as hell
to catch an arm when someone doesn't

656
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
to catch an arm when someone doesn't
 

657
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,829
to catch an arm when someone doesn't

arms are there all the time for you
 

663
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,150

okay

664
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
okay
 

665
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,870
okay
and in real life they're moving

666
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
and in real life they're moving
 

667
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,790
and in real life they're moving
they're moving either to hit you they're

they're moving either to hit you they're

they're moving either to hit you they're
moving to pull out of their out of your

673
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,790
grip
or they're just moving because the

674
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
or they're just moving because the
 

675
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,389
or they're just moving because the

679
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,590
balance
and due to their own personal history

680
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
and due to their own personal history
 

681
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,749
and due to their own personal history
which you have no exposure to because

682
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
which you have no exposure to because
 

683
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,350
which you have no exposure to because
they're not a okay that you train with

684
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
they're not a okay that you train with
 

685
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,509
they're not a okay that you train with
all your life right or ten years or five

686
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
all your life right or ten years or five
 

687
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,389
all your life right or ten years or five
years

688
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
years

years
they put their arms wherever they want

690
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
they put their arms wherever they want
 

691
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,630
they put their arms wherever they want
so the arm is moving

692
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
so the arm is moving
 

693
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,189
so the arm is moving
the idea of catching this arm in mid

694
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
the idea of catching this arm in mid
 

695
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,710
the idea of catching this arm in mid
space for you to pin is just ludicrous

696
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
space for you to pin is just ludicrous
 

697
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,029
space for you to pin is just ludicrous
and what i find when in in the in

909
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,270

yeah it's a cokey repetition it's just

910
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
yeah it's a cokey repetition it's just
 

911
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,350
yeah it's a cokey repetition it's just
working on coke you you will not paint

by holding their
arm down like that

918
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
arm down like that
 

919
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,510
arm down like that
so i know that

920
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
so i know that
 

921
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,350
so i know that
just like that

922
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360

 

923
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,669

you'll have people who will like turn

924
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
you'll have people who will like turn
 

925
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,430
you'll have people who will like turn
the arm

926
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
the arm
 

927
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,310
the arm
and this person is very sensitive to

928
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
and this person is very sensitive to
 

929
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,190
and this person is very sensitive to
pain usually and so they go ah

930
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
pain usually and so they go ah
 

931
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,789
pain usually and so they go ah
and they don't move

932
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
and they don't move
 

933
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,470
and they don't move
okay

934
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
okay
 

935
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,630
okay
or you'll have people will do another

936
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
or you'll have people will do another
 

937
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,830
or you'll have people will do another
pain thing over here with the wrist okay

938
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
pain thing over here with the wrist okay
 

939
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,070
pain thing over here with the wrist okay
and again they they are sensitive to

940
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
and again they they are sensitive to
 

941
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,270
and again they they are sensitive to
pain most

942
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
pain most
 

943
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,070
pain most
aikido practitioners and so

944
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
aikido practitioners and so
 

945
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,510
aikido practitioners and so
they tap out

946
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
they tap out
 

947
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,470
they tap out
but

948
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
but
 

949
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,630
but
that would make it a pain compliance

950
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
that would make it a pain compliance
 

951
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,590
that would make it a pain compliance
move

952
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
move
 

953
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,549
move
okay

954
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
okay
 

955
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,590
okay
it would be no different in essence if i

956
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
it would be no different in essence if i
 

957
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,110
it would be no different in essence if i
pull her hair

958
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120

 

959
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,830

meaning she wants me to stop hurting her

960
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
meaning she wants me to stop hurting her
 

961
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,149
meaning she wants me to stop hurting her
so that's why she's i'm actually picking

962
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
so that's why she's i'm actually picking
 

963
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,909
so that's why she's i'm actually picking
the head up aren't i

964
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
the head up aren't i
 

965
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,789
the head up aren't i
okay

966
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
okay
 

967
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,510
okay
there's nothing there so if we go

968
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520

 

969
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,070

there's there's nothing there at all

970
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
there's there's nothing there at all
 

971
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,710
there's there's nothing there at all
that stops me

972
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
that stops me
 

973
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,510
that stops me
from

974
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
from
 

975
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,830
from
turning over

976
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840

 

977
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,950

there's because pins work in the dynamic

978
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
there's because pins work in the dynamic
 

979
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,070
there's because pins work in the dynamic
fashion

980
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
fashion
 

981
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,830
fashion
the idea that you're going to stop

982
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
the idea that you're going to stop
 

983
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,909
the idea that you're going to stop
reality once and for all and hold it

984
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
reality once and for all and hold it
 

985
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,789
reality once and for all and hold it
still

986
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
still
 

987
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,950
still
isn't that kind of strange

988
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
isn't that kind of strange
 

989
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,390
isn't that kind of strange
once i start moving at all i change the

990
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
once i start moving at all i change the
 

991
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,950
once i start moving at all i change the
geometry so right now she's got her

992
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
geometry so right now she's got her
 

993
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,110
geometry so right now she's got her
weight under her right

994
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
weight under her right
 

995
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,390
weight under her right
but

996
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
but
 

997
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,310
but
now does she

998
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
now does she
 

999
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,470
now does she
no i'm starting to move i'm starting to

1000
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
no i'm starting to move i'm starting to
 

1001
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,549
no i'm starting to move i'm starting to
move it

1002
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
move it
 

1003
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,630
move it
getting down as hard as you can

1004
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
getting down as hard as you can
 

1005
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,310
getting down as hard as you can
donate come push your shoulders down

1006
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
donate come push your shoulders down
 

1007
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,110
donate come push your shoulders down
okay oh that's heavy

1008
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
okay oh that's heavy
 

1009
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,669
okay oh that's heavy
i just moved it okay

1010
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
i just moved it okay
 

1011
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,870
i just moved it okay
and in that ability to move it

1012
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
and in that ability to move it
 

1013
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,590
and in that ability to move it
the effectiveness of the pin is gone

1014
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
the effectiveness of the pin is gone
 

1015
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,590
the effectiveness of the pin is gone
and that allows me to move more parts of

1016
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
and that allows me to move more parts of
 

1017
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,789
and that allows me to move more parts of
my body

1018
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
my body
 

1019
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,830
my body
you see and once i do that i i start to

1020
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
you see and once i do that i i start to
 

1021
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,710
you see and once i do that i i start to
deconstruct the pin even more even more

1022
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
deconstruct the pin even more even more
 

1023
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,470
deconstruct the pin even more even more
even more even more

1024
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
even more even more
 

1025
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,029
even more even more
pins and locks are just moments in time

1026
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
pins and locks are just moments in time
 

1027
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,149
pins and locks are just moments in time
space

1028
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
space
 

1029
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,390
space
and you should think of them as

1030
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400

 

1031
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,029

a kind of controlling of a larger

1032
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
a kind of controlling of a larger
 

1033
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,510
a kind of controlling of a larger
portion of mass or a smaller portion of

1034
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
portion of mass or a smaller portion of
 

1035
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,470
portion of mass or a smaller portion of
that

1036
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
that
 

1037
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,710
that
that's what an opinion is

1038
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
that's what an opinion is
 

1039
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,350
that's what an opinion is
it's not a permanent fixture

1040
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
it's not a permanent fixture
 

1041
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,390
it's not a permanent fixture
okay

1042
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
okay
 

1043
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,230
okay
so that means there should be a pinning

1044
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
so that means there should be a pinning
 

1045
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,390
so that means there should be a pinning
element in my

1046
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
element in my
 

1047
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,750
element in my
nugget too

1048
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
nugget too
 

1049
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,750
nugget too
because i should be controlling a

1050
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
because i should be controlling a
 

1051
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,710
because i should be controlling a
smaller part to move a larger part

1052
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
smaller part to move a larger part
 

1053
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,669
smaller part to move a larger part
got it

1054
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
got it
 

1055
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,549
got it
okay so if i have that assumption i see

1056
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
okay so if i have that assumption i see
 

1057
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,549
okay so if i have that assumption i see
this goofy ass

1058
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
this goofy ass
 

1059
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,310
this goofy ass
thing at the end

1060
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
thing at the end
 

1061
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,350
thing at the end
i should be asking what is that about

1062
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
i should be asking what is that about
 

1063
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,590
i should be asking what is that about
what's going on there because nobody in

1064
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
what's going on there because nobody in
 

1065
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,590
what's going on there because nobody in
their right mind would ever think that

1066
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
their right mind would ever think that
 

1067
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,149
their right mind would ever think that
that's an actual pin and by right mind i

1068
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
that's an actual pin and by right mind i
 

1069
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,470
that's an actual pin and by right mind i
mean a person who actually studied a

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
mean a person who actually studied a

1073
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,310
question

1074
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
and theorized and reflected upon what is

pending
you see no one ever do that or somebody

1078
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
you see no one ever do that or somebody
 

1079
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,510
you see no one ever do that or somebody
who attempted to do it in real life if

people
they too

1086
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
they too
 

1087
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,350
they too
would go that does not work

1088
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360

 

1089
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,950

but the person who doesn't see it

1090
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
but the person who doesn't see it
 

1091
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,789
but the person who doesn't see it
through doesn't then ask

1092
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
through doesn't then ask
 

1093
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,190
through doesn't then ask
what is it for them

1094
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
what is it for them
 

1095
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,669
what is it for them
what is a pin they just go like here it

1096
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
what is a pin they just go like here it
 

1097
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,830
what is a pin they just go like here it
doesn't work

1098
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
doesn't work
 

1099
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,070
doesn't work
or back pain doesn't work

1100
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
or back pain doesn't work
 

1101
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,750
or back pain doesn't work
it's not that's not it's just that

1102
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
it's not that's not it's just that
 

1103
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,549
it's not that's not it's just that
wasn't a pin at all

1104
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
wasn't a pin at all
 

1105
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,350
wasn't a pin at all
but that call q organization

1106
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
but that call q organization
 

1107
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,590
but that call q organization
i do use that in pinning

1108
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
i do use that in pinning
 

1109
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,310
i do use that in pinning
if once i understand what opinion is

1110
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
if once i understand what opinion is
 

1111
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,630
if once i understand what opinion is
then i do use that when i bring that

1112
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,640
then i do use that when i bring that
 

1113
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,510
then i do use that when i bring that
pinion element into my nagawaza

1114
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
pinion element into my nagawaza
 

1115
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,070
pinion element into my nagawaza
i now see that that is the best way of

1116
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
i now see that that is the best way of
 

1117
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,070
i now see that that is the best way of
practicing what pinning truly is

1118
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
practicing what pinning truly is
 

1119
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,350
practicing what pinning truly is
okay

1120
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
okay
 

1121
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,110
okay
it's kind of like that thing i posted

1122
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
it's kind of like that thing i posted
 

1123
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,110
it's kind of like that thing i posted
today about the argument part of the

1124
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
today about the argument part of the
 

1125
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,269
today about the argument part of the
genie if you haven't seen that yet if

1126
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
genie if you haven't seen that yet if
 

1127
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,950
genie if you haven't seen that yet if
you were truly interested in that

1128
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
you were truly interested in that
 

1129
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,230
you were truly interested in that
question

1130
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
question
 

1131
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,070
question
you wouldn't stop there you wouldn't say

1132
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,080
you wouldn't stop there you wouldn't say
 

1133
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,190
you wouldn't stop there you wouldn't say
it sucks

1134
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
it sucks
 

1135
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,110
it sucks
you would try and figure out what what

1136
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
you would try and figure out what what
 

1137
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,950
you would try and figure out what what
any questions

1138
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
any questions
 

1139
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,789
any questions
okay since i've noticed

1140
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799

 

1141
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,909

i feel like

1142
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
i feel like
 

1143
00:26:49,919 --> 00:27:02,710
i feel like
i don't like timing

1144
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720

 

1145
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,950

where

1146
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
where
 

1147
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,549
where
i would ski

1148
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
i would ski
 

1149
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,830
i would ski
but i wouldn't i wouldn't use

1150
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
but i wouldn't i wouldn't use
 

1151
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,470
but i wouldn't i wouldn't use
i wouldn't time this step with the ski

1152
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
i wouldn't time this step with the ski
 

1153
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,390
i wouldn't time this step with the ski
and so when we were doing it to like

1154
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,400
and so when we were doing it to like
 

1155
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,430
and so when we were doing it to like
push each other back it was all alarmed

1156
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
push each other back it was all alarmed
 

1157
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,269
push each other back it was all alarmed
what the heck is this and then later by

1158
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
what the heck is this and then later by
 

1159
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,950
what the heck is this and then later by
the time i showed them how to like get i

1160
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
the time i showed them how to like get i
 

1161
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,350
the time i showed them how to like get i
guess more of a timing stuff more

1162
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
guess more of a timing stuff more
 

1163
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,590
guess more of a timing stuff more
driving it with my body and i feel like

1164
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
driving it with my body and i feel like
 

1165
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,830
driving it with my body and i feel like
i'm also translating into

1166
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
i'm also translating into
 

1167
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,470
i'm also translating into
my nugget was it like some time is wrong

1168
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
my nugget was it like some time is wrong
 

1169
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,230
my nugget was it like some time is wrong
or something i'm moving incorrectly to

1170
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
or something i'm moving incorrectly to
 

1171
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:45,909
or something i'm moving incorrectly to
where

1172
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919

 

1173
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,389

so remember where i told you uh you were

1174
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
so remember where i told you uh you were
 

1175
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,389
so remember where i told you uh you were
working with jake and i said you've got

1176
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
working with jake and i said you've got
 

1177
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,710
working with jake and i said you've got
to stay up so that the arm would be

1178
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
to stay up so that the arm would be
 

1179
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,870
to stay up so that the arm would be
there remember that correction

1180
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
there remember that correction
 

1181
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,630
there remember that correction
okay so that meant

1182
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
okay so that meant
 

1183
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,630
okay so that meant
that you're out of the technique you're

1184
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
that you're out of the technique you're
 

1185
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,630
that you're out of the technique you're
far but i said stay up that means you're

1186
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
far but i said stay up that means you're
 

1187
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,070
far but i said stay up that means you're
not staying up that means you're out of

1188
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
not staying up that means you're out of
 

1189
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,590
not staying up that means you're out of
the city okay

1190
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
the city okay
 

1191
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,590
the city okay
the reason you're out of the technique

1192
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
the reason you're out of the technique
 

1193
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,310
the reason you're out of the technique
is because you're using a different

1194
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
is because you're using a different
 

1195
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,510
is because you're using a different
mechanical organization to move jade

1196
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
mechanical organization to move jade
 

1197
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,950
mechanical organization to move jade
right you're using one where you push

1198
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
right you're using one where you push
 

1199
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,110
right you're using one where you push
against

1200
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,120
against
 

1201
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,230
against
him with your hands

1202
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
him with your hands
 

1203
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,230
him with your hands
versus one where

1204
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
versus one where
 

1205
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,549
versus one where
you push against the ground

1206
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
you push against the ground
 

1207
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,630
you push against the ground
and because you moved

1208
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
and because you moved
 

1209
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,029
and because you moved
he moved all right so that that looks

1210
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
he moved all right so that that looks
 

1211
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,350
he moved all right so that that looks
like this give us some room okay

1212
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
like this give us some room okay
 

1213
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,470
like this give us some room okay
okay so

1214
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
okay so
 

1215
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,590
okay so
here like this and this is you see my

1216
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
here like this and this is you see my
 

1217
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,549
here like this and this is you see my
bracing angle okay and

1218
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
bracing angle okay and
 

1219
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,029
bracing angle okay and
you start to

1220
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
you start to
 

1221
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,590
you start to
your arms start to lengthen okay well

1222
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
your arms start to lengthen okay well
 

1223
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,310
your arms start to lengthen okay well
the unsaid resultant of that is that

1224
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
the unsaid resultant of that is that
 

1225
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,870
the unsaid resultant of that is that
your body is moving further away so if i

1226
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
your body is moving further away so if i
 

1227
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,190
your body is moving further away so if i
start to bend my arms you see how much

1228
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
start to bend my arms you see how much
 

1229
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,590
start to bend my arms you see how much
closer i am to her so when i extend my

1230
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
closer i am to her so when i extend my
 

1231
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,029
closer i am to her so when i extend my
arms like that i'm moving things further

1232
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
arms like that i'm moving things further
 

1233
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,830
arms like that i'm moving things further
from me okay

1234
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
from me okay
 

1235
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,750
from me okay
this if you look at my body i have a

1236
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
this if you look at my body i have a
 

1237
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,190
this if you look at my body i have a
bracing angle

1238
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
bracing angle
 

1239
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,590
bracing angle
that's no difference when we do the coq

1240
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
that's no difference when we do the coq
 

1241
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,710
that's no difference when we do the coq
training elements and you're doing this

1242
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
training elements and you're doing this
 

1243
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,190
training elements and you're doing this
which now becomes exposed when she lets

1244
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
which now becomes exposed when she lets
 

1245
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,389
which now becomes exposed when she lets
go fast

1246
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
go fast
 

1247
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,870
go fast
you'll fall forward same kind of thing

1248
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
you'll fall forward same kind of thing
 

1249
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,430
you'll fall forward same kind of thing
across the ground you come like this and

across the ground you come like this and
if they fall forward

1252
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,200
if they fall forward
 

1253
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,430
if they fall forward
fall forward you kind of

1254
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
fall forward you kind of
 

1255
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,510
fall forward you kind of
do that stumbling which you also do

1256

the more i bring the foot forward the
 

1327
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,070
the more i bring the foot forward the
more i fall back i have to shift weight

1328
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
more i fall back i have to shift weight
 

1329
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,669
more i fall back i have to shift weight
from this foot

1330
