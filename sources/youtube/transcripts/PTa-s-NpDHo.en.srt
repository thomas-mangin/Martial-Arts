1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:06,610

so when you sit on the cushion in zazen

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:06,620
so when you sit on the cushion in zazen
 

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,740
so when you sit on the cushion in zazen
the assumption is that you're going to

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:09,750
the assumption is that you're going to
 

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,549
the assumption is that you're going to
make this kind of pyramid with your

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
make this kind of pyramid with your
 

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,390
make this kind of pyramid with your
knees and your spine and so you become

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,400
knees and your spine and so you become
 

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,990
knees and your spine and so you become
very stable okay and you notice that

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,000
very stable okay and you notice that
 

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,090
very stable okay and you notice that
when you take away the cushion and

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
when you take away the cushion and
 

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,160
when you take away the cushion and
you're sitting and say tha I should

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,170
you're sitting and say tha I should
 

15
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,029
you're sitting and say tha I should
still have that pyramid shape to me with

16
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
still have that pyramid shape to me with
 

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,069
still have that pyramid shape to me with
my spine acting as a kind of axis mundi

18
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
my spine acting as a kind of axis mundi
 

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,020
my spine acting as a kind of axis mundi
the center of the earth

20
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,030
the center of the earth
 

21
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,130
the center of the earth
okay this axial so if I start doing this

22
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,140
okay this axial so if I start doing this
 

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,889
okay this axial so if I start doing this
and if I just relax you'll see what will

24
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:45,899
and if I just relax you'll see what will
 

25
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,630
and if I just relax you'll see what will
happen you see what's happening already

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,640
happen you see what's happening already
 

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,150
happen you see what's happening already
my nose is moving away from him you see

28
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
my nose is moving away from him you see
 

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,970
my nose is moving away from him you see
that because my center of gravity is

30
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:52,980
that because my center of gravity is
 

31
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,260
that because my center of gravity is
going this way you got that then if I

32
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,270
going this way you got that then if I
 

33
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,830
going this way you got that then if I
tilt it the other way do you see you see

34
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:00,840
tilt it the other way do you see you see
 

35
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,569
tilt it the other way do you see you see
this this is very common right you know

36
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:02,579
this this is very common right you know
 

37
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,690
this this is very common right you know
and then you just relax and look what's

38
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,700
and then you just relax and look what's
 

39
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,890
and then you just relax and look what's
happening right nose is moving to you

40
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:06,900
happening right nose is moving to you
 

41
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,100
happening right nose is moving to you
towards did you see that so the way that

42
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,110
towards did you see that so the way that
 

43
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,280
towards did you see that so the way that
people keep their posture like this with

44
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,290
people keep their posture like this with
 

45
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,770
people keep their posture like this with
this pelvic tilt is they keep making

46
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:15,780
this pelvic tilt is they keep making
 

47
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,130
this pelvic tilt is they keep making
micro adjustments like modern aircrafts

48
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
micro adjustments like modern aircrafts
 

49
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,890
micro adjustments like modern aircrafts
do you know they can't fly and so the

50
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
do you know they can't fly and so the
 

51
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,170
do you know they can't fly and so the
wings have to keep adjusting and you

52
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,180
wings have to keep adjusting and you
 

53
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,700
wings have to keep adjusting and you
keep making micro adjustments and they

54
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:25,710
keep making micro adjustments and they
 

55
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,910
keep making micro adjustments and they
call that stability okay so the same

56
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
call that stability okay so the same
 

57
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,560
call that stability okay so the same
thing when you're like this you keep

58
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,570
thing when you're like this you keep
 

59
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,359
thing when you're like this you keep
making micro adjustments to keep you

60
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:32,369
making micro adjustments to keep you
 

61
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,390
making micro adjustments to keep you
from falling backwards do you understand

62
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,400
from falling backwards do you understand
 

63
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,120
from falling backwards do you understand
so that would not be a pyramid of course

64
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,130
so that would not be a pyramid of course
 

65
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,050
so that would not be a pyramid of course
tactically when I'm like this and he

66
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
tactically when I'm like this and he
 

67
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,730
tactically when I'm like this and he
goes to grab the back of my head to pull

68
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:46,740
goes to grab the back of my head to pull
 

69
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,859
goes to grab the back of my head to pull
me down right he's gonna he's gonna get

70
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:48,869
me down right he's gonna he's gonna get
 

71
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,069
me down right he's gonna he's gonna get
me I sit like this and he goes to thrust

72
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
me I sit like this and he goes to thrust
 

73
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,730
me I sit like this and he goes to thrust
he's gonna get me and it takes away one

74
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,740
he's gonna get me and it takes away one

if you keep having to make micro
adjustments to hold yourself still so I

134
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,320
adjustments to hold yourself still so I
 

135
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,830
adjustments to hold yourself still so I
have to put that as the top part of my

head to keep my balance then my pelvis

138
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,380
head to keep my balance then my pelvis
 

139
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,920
head to keep my balance then my pelvis
is not like this in a bracing angle but

140
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:51,930
is not like this in a bracing angle but
 

141
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,890
is not like this in a bracing angle but
angled so that I feel I'm neither going

142
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:55,900
angled so that I feel I'm neither going
 

143
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,060
angled so that I feel I'm neither going
forward nor backwards okay and then

144
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,070
forward nor backwards okay and then
 

145
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,630
forward nor backwards okay and then
tactically of course my chin is now

146
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:03,640
tactically of course my chin is now

weight is going down now here's the
 

165
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,610
weight is going down now here's the
trick when we do this he goes do you see

166
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:31,620
trick when we do this he goes do you see
 

167
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,310

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
he got lifted did you feel so you gotta
 

169
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,470
he got lifted did you feel so you gotta
what you got to watch here and I'm just

170
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:39,480
what you got to watch here and I'm just
 

171
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,030
what you got to watch here and I'm just
here in that position and of course if I

172
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
here in that position and of course if I
 

173
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,250
here in that position and of course if I
don't lock everything if this is all

174
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,260
don't lock everything if this is all
 

175
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,580
don't lock everything if this is all
soft then I'm not really a pyramid I'm

176
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:49,590
soft then I'm not really a pyramid I'm
 

177
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,550
soft then I'm not really a pyramid I'm
more like soft-serve ice cream to get it

178
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
more like soft-serve ice cream to get it
 

179
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,620
more like soft-serve ice cream to get it
if you ever push that thing out all of a

180
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,630
if you ever push that thing out all of a
 

181
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,880
if you ever push that thing out all of a
sudden you're like oh that looked like

182
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:55,890
sudden you're like oh that looked like
 

183
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,040
sudden you're like oh that looked like
it was balanced but it has no integrity

184
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,050
it was balanced but it has no integrity
 

185
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,760
it was balanced but it has no integrity
to it so I have to lock the pyramid in

186
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:01,770
to it so I have to lock the pyramid in
 

187
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,400
to it so I have to lock the pyramid in
shape and then when he goes he he moves

188
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,410
shape and then when he goes he he moves
 

189
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,150
shape and then when he goes he he moves
Ducey do you guys see that okay now the

190
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
Ducey do you guys see that okay now the
 

191
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,940
Ducey do you guys see that okay now the
problem is when I give you that drill

192
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:09,950
problem is when I give you that drill
 

193
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,850
problem is when I give you that drill
you start doing you doing like this do

194
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:13,860
you start doing you doing like this do
 

195
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,100
you start doing you doing like this do
you see that difference i I'm you can

196
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,110

 

197
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,330

see right here I'm just here

198
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340

 

199
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:31,010

okay so you have to not want to push him

200
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,020
okay so you have to not want to push him
 

201
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,440
okay so you have to not want to push him
what you have to do is in the face of

202
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,450
what you have to do is in the face of
 

203
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,430
what you have to do is in the face of
his push you just hold your structure

204
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,440
his push you just hold your structure
 

205
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,110
his push you just hold your structure
that's where you put your effort

206
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
that's where you put your effort
 

207
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
that's where you put your effort
hold your structure so when you feel

208
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,290
hold your structure so when you feel
 

209
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,400
hold your structure so when you feel
this going like that don't correct like

210
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,410
this going like that don't correct like
 

211
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,060
this going like that don't correct like
that correct like this do you see that

212
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,070
that correct like this do you see that
 

213
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:58,130
that correct like this do you see that
difference so hold the structure I'm

214
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,140
difference so hold the structure I'm
 

215
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,260
difference so hold the structure I'm
going to hold it okay let's try

216
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,270
going to hold it okay let's try
 

217
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,120
going to hold it okay let's try
everything that is a little harder he's

218
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,130
everything that is a little harder he's
 

219
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,010
everything that is a little harder he's
a better cultivating tool but the

220
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,020
a better cultivating tool but the
 

221
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,180
a better cultivating tool but the
downside is if it's harder I probably

222
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,190
downside is if it's harder I probably
 

223
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,900
downside is if it's harder I probably
won't be able to use it okay so this

224
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:20,910
won't be able to use it okay so this
 

225
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,390
won't be able to use it okay so this
this drill this drill here allows me to

226
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
this drill this drill here allows me to
 

227
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,210
this drill this drill here allows me to
try to use my bicep and shoulder you see

228
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,220
try to use my bicep and shoulder you see
 

229
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:37,930
try to use my bicep and shoulder you see
that and so it's not a very good tool

230
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:37,940
that and so it's not a very good tool
 

231
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,470
that and so it's not a very good tool
because it allows so much okay but as I

232
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,480
because it allows so much okay but as I
 

233
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,310
because it allows so much okay but as I
said this this hand positioning is a

234
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:46,320
said this this hand positioning is a
 

235
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,570
said this this hand positioning is a
matter of this structuring so I'm going

236
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,580
matter of this structuring so I'm going
 

237
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,760
matter of this structuring so I'm going
to take away the hand positioning and I

238
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:55,770
to take away the hand positioning and I
 

239
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,280
to take away the hand positioning and I
again I'm going to just do this turn do

240
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,290
again I'm going to just do this turn do
 

241
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,580
again I'm going to just do this turn do

push and I'm just holding the structure
 

257
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,730
push and I'm just holding the structure
stay connected you can see okay so now I

258
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:31,740
stay connected you can see okay so now I
 

259
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,460
stay connected you can see okay so now I
can't do the other one but if I'm mushy

260
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,470
can't do the other one but if I'm mushy

row boom you should have it and then
 

277
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,630
row boom you should have it and then
this one he's going to do incrementally

278
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:56,640
this one he's going to do incrementally
 

279
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,220
this one he's going to do incrementally
and I'm just gonna hold the structure

280
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,230
and I'm just gonna hold the structure
 

281
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:12,890
