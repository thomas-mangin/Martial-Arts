85
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,490

and I am going to send the feet

86
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,500
and I am going to send the feet
 

87
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,130
and I am going to send the feet
in that direction go back go back go

stop
 

107
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,390
stop
okay and you'd be pulling a little

108
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
okay and you'd be pulling a little
 

109
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,770
okay and you'd be pulling a little
here

110
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:39,780
here
 

111
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,589
here
what this does stop right there and just

112
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
what this does stop right there and just
 

113
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,589
what this does stop right there and just
stay there taunt yours please make good

114
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
stay there taunt yours please make good
 

115
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,430
stay there taunt yours please make good
time

116
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440

 

117
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,070

this creates where you see that head is

118
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
this creates where you see that head is
 

119
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,790
this creates where you see that head is
going to start falling this way okay

120
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800

 

121
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,369

Road and handle

122
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:04,379

 

123
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,830

here's where this arm is working

124
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
here's where this arm is working
 

125
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,270
here's where this arm is working
okay

126
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,280
okay
 

127
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,149
okay
and he's now

128
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,159
and he's now
 

129
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,770
and he's now
spinning

130
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:12,780
spinning
 

131
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,210
spinning
this way

132
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,220
this way
 

133
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,710
this way
do you see

134
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:15,720
do you see
 

135
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,190
do you see
okay so if I have this energy here

136
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,200
okay so if I have this energy here
 

137
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,210
okay so if I have this energy here
you're going to pull yours that way

138
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
you're going to pull yours that way
 

139
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,149
you're going to pull yours that way
you're going to pull yours straight and

140
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
you're going to pull yours straight and
 

141
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,949
you're going to pull yours straight and
you're going to pull yours wait till I

142
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
you're going to pull yours wait till I
 

143
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,430
you're going to pull yours wait till I
say go ready go

144
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,440
say go ready go
 

145
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,390
say go ready go
and this is what happens okay now

146
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
and this is what happens okay now
 

147
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,050
and this is what happens okay now
he's parallel to the ground do you see

148
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,060
he's parallel to the ground do you see
 

149
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,570
he's parallel to the ground do you see
and when I say let go

150
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:44,580
and when I say let go
 

151
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,009
and when I say let go
let go got it one two three let go

152
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:49,019
let go got it one two three let go
 

153
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,869
let go got it one two three let go
and the guy falls

154
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
and the guy falls
 

155
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,949
and the guy falls
okay

156
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959

 

157
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,830

so a couple things

158
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
so a couple things
 

159
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,229
so a couple things
we have to figure out how to get the

160
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
we have to figure out how to get the
 

161
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,970
we have to figure out how to get the
tilt

162
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:01,980
tilt
 

163
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,949
tilt
right because that was the start of it

164
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959
right because that was the start of it
 

165
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,210
right because that was the start of it
all

166
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,220
all
 

167
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,390
all
and we have to figure out

168
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
and we have to figure out
 

169
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,710
and we have to figure out
how to keep his energy going forward

170
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720

 

171
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,470

we have to understand

172
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,480
we have to understand
 

173
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,530
we have to understand
how to keep his feet going forward but

174
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:18,540
how to keep his feet going forward but
 

175
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,650
how to keep his feet going forward but
at another angle to his Center

176
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:21,660
at another angle to his Center
 

177
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,730
at another angle to his Center
and we have to have it so that his head

178
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740
and we have to have it so that his head
 

179
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,830
and we have to have it so that his head
is going backwards

180
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
is going backwards
 

181
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,129
is going backwards
but it's not from my arm

182
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:31,139
but it's not from my arm
 

183
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,350
but it's not from my arm
pushing her backwards he goes before

184
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
pushing her backwards he goes before
 

185
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,370
pushing her backwards he goes before
that

186
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,380
that
 

187
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,010
that
okay and I'll show you where those three

188
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,020
okay and I'll show you where those three
 

189
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,969
okay and I'll show you where those three
forces are in the technique okay as far

190
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:40,979
forces are in the technique okay as far
 

191
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,770
forces are in the technique okay as far
as what you touch

192
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:42,780
as what you touch
 

193
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,230
as what you touch
it's not relevant whatever you're

194
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
it's not relevant whatever you're
 

195
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,830
it's not relevant whatever you're
touching that's the pattern so I might

196
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
touching that's the pattern so I might
 

197
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,990
touching that's the pattern so I might
be on the front of his face on his

198
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
be on the front of his face on his
 

199
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,969
be on the front of his face on his
throat I'd never be on the chest though

200
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:52,979
throat I'd never be on the chest though
 

201
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,550
throat I'd never be on the chest though
that's too much mass I want to be at the

202
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
that's too much mass I want to be at the
 

203
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,610
that's too much mass I want to be at the
extremity of the spine so that's going

204
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:58,620
extremity of the spine so that's going
 

205
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,890
extremity of the spine so that's going
to be somewhere on the face I don't care

206
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
to be somewhere on the face I don't care
 

207
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,249
to be somewhere on the face I don't care
if he's looking in straight up down it

208
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,259
if he's looking in straight up down it
 

209
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,010
if he's looking in straight up down it
doesn't matter okay as far as the leg

210
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,020
doesn't matter okay as far as the leg
 

211
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,770
doesn't matter okay as far as the leg
goes I don't care either where I am on

212
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:09,780
goes I don't care either where I am on
 

213
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,350
goes I don't care either where I am on
the leg uh it has a lot to do with his

214
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
the leg uh it has a lot to do with his
 

215
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,810
the leg uh it has a lot to do with his
height my height and things like that I

216
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:14,820
height my height and things like that I
 

217
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,909
height my height and things like that I
just need the stance to go one way that

218
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:16,919
just need the stance to go one way that
 

219
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,150
just need the stance to go one way that
had to go the other way

220
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160

 

221
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,370

okay

222
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,380
okay
 

223
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,210
okay
so first let's deal with the Tilt and

224
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
so first let's deal with the Tilt and
 

225
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,610
so first let's deal with the Tilt and
their forward progress how do I do that

226
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,620
their forward progress how do I do that
 

227
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,370
their forward progress how do I do that
I called it osense

228
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,380
I called it osense
 

229
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,590
I called it osense
okay

230
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
okay
 

231
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,650
okay
his uh spine is coming in by

232
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:36,660
his uh spine is coming in by
 

233
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,510
his uh spine is coming in by
prescription

234
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,520
prescription
 

235
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,529
prescription
and I want to move him in a way that I

236
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:42,539
and I want to move him in a way that I
 

237
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,529
and I want to move him in a way that I
have forward energy but he starts to

238
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:45,539
have forward energy but he starts to
 

239
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,290
have forward energy but he starts to
tilt he just starts to tilt that's all I

240
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,300
tilt he just starts to tilt that's all I
 

241
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,050
tilt he just starts to tilt that's all I
need that's all you need it doesn't have

242
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
need that's all you need it doesn't have
 

243
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,730
need that's all you need it doesn't have
to be a big thing

244
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,740
to be a big thing
 

245
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,189
to be a big thing
and it's not back

246
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
and it's not back
 

247
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,310
and it's not back
he tilts

248
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,320
he tilts
 

249
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,529
he tilts
so maybe over here

250
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,539

 

251
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,070

he comes in and there's your tilt there

252
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

 

253
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,390

uh I'll demonstrate the forward progress

254
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
uh I'll demonstrate the forward progress
 

255
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,550
uh I'll demonstrate the forward progress
by having him pull

256
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
by having him pull
 

257
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,590
by having him pull
he's not pushing

258
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:18,600
he's not pushing
 

259
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,090
he's not pushing
okay so he's pulling me he's pulling me

260
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,100
okay so he's pulling me he's pulling me
 

261
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,689
okay so he's pulling me he's pulling me
okay and I'm Brown you see and this

262
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:26,699
okay and I'm Brown you see and this
 

263
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,550
okay and I'm Brown you see and this
thing's making him move forward making

264
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
thing's making him move forward making
 

265
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,330
thing's making him move forward making
him move forward and into itself

266
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340

 

267
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,210

I'm not just getting out of the way and

268
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm not just getting out of the way and
 

269
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,490
I'm not just getting out of the way and
he leans his head in that's not what

270
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
he leans his head in that's not what
 

271
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,210
he leans his head in that's not what
happens

272
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,220
happens
 

273
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,610
happens
okay

274
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:43,620
okay
 

275
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,689
okay
um

276
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:44,699
um
 

277
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,749
um
his body is very segmented

278
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
his body is very segmented
 

279
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,629
his body is very segmented
the Joe is not segmented

280
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
the Joe is not segmented
 

281
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,150
the Joe is not segmented
this is where the internal aspect comes

282
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,160
this is where the internal aspect comes
 

283
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,870
this is where the internal aspect comes
in

284
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
in
 

285
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,670
in
so uh as he pulls

286
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
so uh as he pulls
 

287
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,730
so uh as he pulls
I unify his body

288
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:01,740
I unify his body
 

289
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,029
I unify his body
and I can make it go where I want

290
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,039

 

291
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,010

I'm not just getting out of the way

292
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm not just getting out of the way
 

293
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,010
I'm not just getting out of the way
let's have you push I'm not just getting

294
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,020
let's have you push I'm not just getting
 

295
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,350
let's have you push I'm not just getting
out of the way

296
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
out of the way
 

297
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,529
out of the way
and then culturally expect him to lean

298
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:18,539
and then culturally expect him to lean
 

299
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,309
and then culturally expect him to lean
into me that's not what's happening

300
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
into me that's not what's happening
 

301
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,749
into me that's not what's happening
from here

302
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
from here
 

303
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,809
from here
I I'm going to manipulate his whole body

304
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:26,819
I I'm going to manipulate his whole body
 

305
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,830
I I'm going to manipulate his whole body
his whole body is moving

306
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840

 

307
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,330

that's the forward progress

308
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340

 

309
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,029

the backwards progress

310
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
the backwards progress
 

311
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,550
the backwards progress
comes from the second spiral I'm going

312
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:43,560
comes from the second spiral I'm going
 

313
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,070
comes from the second spiral I'm going
to make with my hand

314
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,080
to make with my hand
 

315
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,189
to make with my hand
[Music]

316
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
[Music]
 

317
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,909
[Music]
so my hand did the

318
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
so my hand did the
 

319
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,450
so my hand did the
our spiral in essence but I'm now going

320
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:53,460
our spiral in essence but I'm now going
 

321
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,570
our spiral in essence but I'm now going
to do the inward spiral

322
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
to do the inward spiral
 

323
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,670
to do the inward spiral
and you want to pay attention to the

324
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,680
and you want to pay attention to the
 

325
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,029
and you want to pay attention to the
Elbow of the Airborne spiral that

326
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,039
Elbow of the Airborne spiral that
 

327
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,089
Elbow of the Airborne spiral that
elbow's going back

328
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
elbow's going back
 

329
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,390
elbow's going back
so as he's stuck here

330
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
so as he's stuck here
 

331
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,990
so as he's stuck here
and I go up and that's what starts the

332
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
and I go up and that's what starts the
 

333
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,189
and I go up and that's what starts the
backward progress

334
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:16,199

 

335
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,249

so here's the Tilt and forward boom and

336
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:19,259
so here's the Tilt and forward boom and
 

337
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,850
so here's the Tilt and forward boom and
then that's where he's going backwards

338
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:21,860
then that's where he's going backwards
 

339
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,110
then that's where he's going backwards
here's where I enter

340
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,120
here's where I enter
 

341
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,089
here's where I enter
okay

342
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:26,099
okay
 

343
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,629
okay
I'll just get in the final position

344
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
I'll just get in the final position
 

345
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,449
I'll just get in the final position
here's where my edema is

346
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:32,459
here's where my edema is
 

347
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,029
here's where my edema is
and then I spin him

348
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
and then I spin him
 

349
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,370
and then I spin him

more oriented towards the energetic
 

523
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,650
more oriented towards the energetic
component of my art of my practice okay

524
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:29,660
component of my art of my practice okay
 

525
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,870
component of my art of my practice okay
if you pay attention again reminding you

526
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
if you pay attention again reminding you
 

527
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,569
if you pay attention again reminding you
you have only two arm movements in

528
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:35,579
you have only two arm movements in
 

529
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,569
you have only two arm movements in
Aikido kimono you'll have

530
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:38,579
Aikido kimono you'll have
 

531
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,810
Aikido kimono you'll have
the outward spiral

532
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:41,820
the outward spiral
 

533
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,230
the outward spiral
and it's inverse the inverse spiral

534
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,240
and it's inverse the inverse spiral
 

535
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,850
and it's inverse the inverse spiral
out

536
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:46,860

537
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,829

539
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,230
in water
young fire

540
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,240

541
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,290
young fire
what you're doing in this Kokyo Hall

542
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:54,300
what you're doing in this Kokyo Hall
 

543
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,069
what you're doing in this Kokyo Hall
is both spirals with one hand

544
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
is both spirals with one hand
 

545
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,509
is both spirals with one hand
so

546
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
so
 

547
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,110
so
here is going to be

548
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
here is going to be
 

549
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,569
here is going to be
I know it looks like I'm going in but

550
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:05,579
I know it looks like I'm going in but
 

551
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,030
I know it looks like I'm going in but
it's actually the outward spiral

552
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
it's actually the outward spiral
 

553
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,730
it's actually the outward spiral
so I'm doing the hour spiral

554
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,740
so I'm doing the hour spiral
 

555
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,210
so I'm doing the hour spiral
then I do the inward spiral it's right

556
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
then I do the inward spiral it's right
 

557
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,750
then I do the inward spiral it's right
here

558
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760

 

559
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,810

so in one technique you're reconciling

560
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:20,820
so in one technique you're reconciling
 

561
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,629
so in one technique you're reconciling
in a non-fire water

562
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:23,639
in a non-fire water
 

563
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,230
in a non-fire water
and your dust rotating the tandem fields

564
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,240
and your dust rotating the tandem fields
 

565
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,230
and your dust rotating the tandem fields
on that rotating cross pattern that we

566
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
on that rotating cross pattern that we
 

567
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,569
on that rotating cross pattern that we
mentioned in a few videos ago all in one

568
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:32,579
mentioned in a few videos ago all in one
 

569
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,690
mentioned in a few videos ago all in one
technique okay so you want to make sure

570
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:35,700
technique okay so you want to make sure
 

571
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,129
technique okay so you want to make sure
you do that

572
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:37,139
you do that
 

573
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,829
you do that
which makes it energetically incorrect

574
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
which makes it energetically incorrect
 

575
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,230
which makes it energetically incorrect
to go here because that's not one of

576
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
to go here because that's not one of
 

577
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,449
to go here because that's not one of
those spirals it's not working the Tom

578
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:44,459
those spirals it's not working the Tom
 

579
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,970
those spirals it's not working the Tom
denfield okay

580
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:46,980
denfield okay
 

581
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,710
denfield okay
so

582
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
so
 

583
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,410
so
whoa

584
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:50,420
whoa
 

585
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,150
whoa
if you take him out of it

586
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,160
if you take him out of it
 

587
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,710
if you take him out of it
I go in here

588
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720

 

589
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,090

and I'll exaggerate the time then

590
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,100

 

591
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,170

okay but all that's internal

592
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,180

 

593
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,810

that's your ritual

594
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:11,820

 

595
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,790

that gets that rotating tandem field is

596
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
that gets that rotating tandem field is
 

597
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,810
that gets that rotating tandem field is
what I do to him internally I rotate his

598
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:20,820
what I do to him internally I rotate his
 

599
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,310
what I do to him internally I rotate his
internal condom feel

600
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,320

 

601
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,110

rotate his internal content

602
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,120

 

603
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,850

making this

604
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:31,860
making this
 

605
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,610
making this
wrong

606
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:33,620
wrong
 

607
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,889
wrong
that's just crap okay

608
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:36,899
that's just crap okay
 

609
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,650
that's just crap okay
let's try it again

610
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
let's try it again
 

611
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,189
let's try it again
so for you you all here I kind of

612
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
so for you you all here I kind of
 

613
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,949
so for you you all here I kind of
slipped by you but I'm just doing energy

614
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
slipped by you but I'm just doing energy
 

615
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,910
slipped by you but I'm just doing energy
work and the other hand is is part of

616
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
work and the other hand is is part of
 

617
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,110
work and the other hand is is part of
the energy work okay so in up to here I

618
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,120
the energy work okay so in up to here I
 

619
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,990
the energy work okay so in up to here I
was just showing the mechanics right the

620
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
was just showing the mechanics right the
 

621
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,509
was just showing the mechanics right the
architecture uh yesterday with a

622
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
architecture uh yesterday with a
 

623
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,790
architecture uh yesterday with a
demonstration I'm just going to do the

624
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
demonstration I'm just going to do the
 

625
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,530
demonstration I'm just going to do the
energy work and you pick up what you

626
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:03,540
energy work and you pick up what you
 

627
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,970
energy work and you pick up what you
want okay so as uh this hands come here

628
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:07,980
want okay so as uh this hands come here
 

629
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,530
want okay so as uh this hands come here
I would like for you to pay attention to

630
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:09,540
I would like for you to pay attention to
 

631
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,910
I would like for you to pay attention to
this hand okay so this hand is headed up

632
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
this hand okay so this hand is headed up
 

633
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,129
this hand okay so this hand is headed up
then we'll go down missing

634
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:18,139
then we'll go down missing
 

635
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,629
then we'll go down missing
couldn't watch last night's video and

636
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
couldn't watch last night's video and
 

637
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,170
couldn't watch last night's video and
you'll see that happen pop down okay

638
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,180
you'll see that happen pop down okay
 

639
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,790
you'll see that happen pop down okay
so I'm over here

640
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800

 

641
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,949

you are watching this hand right now

642
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
you are watching this hand right now
 

643
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,610
you are watching this hand right now
okay we already talked about it so come

644
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:34,620
okay we already talked about it so come
 

645
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,769
okay we already talked about it so come
on this one

646
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:39,779

 

647
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,230

well

648
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240

 

649
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,910

until it goes back in

650
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920

 

651
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,689

doesn't change here the stripe is the

652
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:50,699
doesn't change here the stripe is the
 

653
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,930
doesn't change here the stripe is the
Edward spiral

654
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:53,940

 

655
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,949

this way then pull them down

656
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959

 

657
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,130

so this is the outer spiral this is the

658
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,140
so this is the outer spiral this is the
 

659
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,350
so this is the outer spiral this is the
inner spiral and they're going to trade

660
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,360
inner spiral and they're going to trade
 

661
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,079
inner spiral and they're going to trade
places

662
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,089

that's where this hand is it's in the

670
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
that's where this hand is it's in the
 

671
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,250
that's where this hand is it's in the
way

672
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,260
way
 

673
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,669
way
when this hand is here the sand is in

674
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
when this hand is here the sand is in
 

675
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,990
when this hand is here the sand is in
the bottom

676
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,000
the bottom
 

677
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,710
the bottom
then they trade places

678
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720

 

679
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,970

do you understand

680
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:40,980
do you understand
 

681
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,650
do you understand
what if we pay attention to the other

682
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:42,660
what if we pay attention to the other
 

683
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,610
what if we pay attention to the other
hand

684

hand
 

685
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,190
hand
it's doing like my demonstration this is

686
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,200
it's doing like my demonstration this is
 

687
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:53,770
it's doing like my demonstration this is
dead

688
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:53,780

 

689
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,620

okay try it again
