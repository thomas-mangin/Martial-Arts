1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,860

so there's a second before you you

2
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:43,870
so there's a second before you you
 

3
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,660
so there's a second before you you
recognize something obviously he's

4
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:45,670
recognize something obviously he's
 

5
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,069
recognize something obviously he's
pushing that way so I'm going to let it

6
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
pushing that way so I'm going to let it
 

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,530
pushing that way so I'm going to let it
push me I do it with a mixture of a

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:54,540
push me I do it with a mixture of a
 

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,479
push me I do it with a mixture of a
rotation I did with a mixture of a

10
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:57,489
rotation I did with a mixture of a
 

11
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,869
rotation I did with a mixture of a
weight shift due to a mixture of

12
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
weight shift due to a mixture of
 

13
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,580
weight shift due to a mixture of
synchronize and her sequencing my corner

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:05,590
synchronize and her sequencing my corner
 

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,300
synchronize and her sequencing my corner
movement my chosen hip movement so oh I

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,310
movement my chosen hip movement so oh I
 

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,400
movement my chosen hip movement so oh I
think I make it very soft so I think

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,410
think I make it very soft so I think
 

19
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,499
think I make it very soft so I think
he's he's not really pushing on anything

20
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:15,509

 

21
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,370

so I try to let's say his force is 10

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,380
so I try to let's say his force is 10
 

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,040
so I try to let's say his force is 10
I'm trying to give him a space of 10 so

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,050
I'm trying to give him a space of 10 so
 

25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm trying to give him a space of 10 so
he's not really pushing it on anything

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,090
he's not really pushing it on anything
 

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,630
he's not really pushing it on anything
and then he will fall into that hole and

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
and then he will fall into that hole and
 

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,170
and then he will fall into that hole and
I'm not pushing that's the drill so whoa

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm not pushing that's the drill so whoa
 

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,649
I'm not pushing that's the drill so whoa
he'll fall into the hole my drill is to

32
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:40,659
he'll fall into the hole my drill is to
 

33
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,620
he'll fall into the hole my drill is to
make a space of 10 for his force of 10

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,630
make a space of 10 for his force of 10
 

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,880
make a space of 10 for his force of 10
pull if you pay attention to my arm

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:50,890
pull if you pay attention to my arm
 

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,880
pull if you pay attention to my arm
you'll see how relaxed it is okay but

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:55,890
you'll see how relaxed it is okay but
 

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,010
you'll see how relaxed it is okay but
it's not this

40
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,020

 

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,240

nothing's going to imagine really happen

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,250
nothing's going to imagine really happen
 

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,010
nothing's going to imagine really happen
because you relax like you're going to

44
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,020
because you relax like you're going to
 

45
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,710
because you relax like you're going to
sleep so even as I'm doing this look at

46
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:11,720
sleep so even as I'm doing this look at
 

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,770
sleep so even as I'm doing this look at
it tactically look at the check on his

48
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:14,780
it tactically look at the check on his
 

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,290
it tactically look at the check on his
shoulder you see when you guys just

50
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,300
shoulder you see when you guys just
 

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,210
shoulder you see when you guys just
relax you having to check on his

52
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,220
relax you having to check on his
 

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,479
relax you having to check on his
shoulder look at the tilt on his spine

54
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:27,489
shoulder look at the tilt on his spine
 

55
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,240
shoulder look at the tilt on his spine
see when you're doing it you have no

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,250
see when you're doing it you have no
 

57
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,199
see when you're doing it you have no
tilt on this part so go slow so if I'm

58
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,209
tilt on this part so go slow so if I'm
 

59
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,900
tilt on this part so go slow so if I'm
doing it right you're going to get the

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:40,910
doing it right you're going to get the
 

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,759
doing it right you're going to get the
cross lateral check on this shoulder

62
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:42,769
cross lateral check on this shoulder
 

63
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,340
cross lateral check on this shoulder
you're gonna get the tilt on his spine

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,350
you're gonna get the tilt on his spine
 

65
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,970
you're gonna get the tilt on his spine
and now this is just dropping that's

66
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:48,980
and now this is just dropping that's
 

67
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,090
and now this is just dropping that's
where he's going to want to fall that's

68
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,100
where he's going to want to fall that's
 

69
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:00,339
where he's going to want to fall that's
different from this it is also different

70
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:00,349
different from this it is also different
 

71
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,670
different from this it is also different
from this I want to establish the zero

72
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:06,680
from this I want to establish the zero
 

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,120
from this I want to establish the zero
point so you can see how light I did

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,130
point so you can see how light I did
 

75
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,789
point so you can see how light I did
okay try it so even if he's standing

76
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:12,799
okay try it so even if he's standing
 

77
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,849
okay try it so even if he's standing
still there's still a force to it right

78
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:15,859
still there's still a force to it right
 

79
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,190
still there's still a force to it right
there's still a force to it it I'll have

80
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,200
there's still a force to it it I'll have
 

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,789
there's still a force to it it I'll have
to be able to find so I moved more

82
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
to be able to find so I moved more
 

83
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,060
to be able to find so I moved more
forward did you see right now his

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,070
forward did you see right now his
 

85
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,460
forward did you see right now his
gravitational pull has a force oh okay I

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,470
gravitational pull has a force oh okay I
 

87
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,289
gravitational pull has a force oh okay I
have to keep you grip I have to

88
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:32,299
have to keep you grip I have to
 

89
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,800
have to keep you grip I have to
neutralize it

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:38,810

 

91
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,539

so he's coming in he's gonna keep his

92
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:41,549
so he's coming in he's gonna keep his
 

93
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:59,230
so he's coming in he's gonna keep his
grip straighten your spine when you roll

94
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,240

 

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:09,310

[Music]

96
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,320

 

97
00:04:09,320 --> 00:05:20,640

[Music]

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:20,650

 

99
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,860

so you have to move out because of the

100
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:26,870
so you have to move out because of the
 

101
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,720
so you have to move out because of the
weight that's come in is and if you are

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:31,730
weight that's come in is and if you are
 

103
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,140
weight that's come in is and if you are
not pushed over by that weight because

104
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,150
not pushed over by that weight because
 

105
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,950
not pushed over by that weight because
you moved out of this range then your

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
you moved out of this range then your
 

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,460
you moved out of this range then your
penetration range is not there do you

108
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,470
penetration range is not there do you
 

109
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,480
penetration range is not there do you
understand that so again way what you

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,490
understand that so again way what you
 

111
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,330
understand that so again way what you
are doing so if the arm is fine but they

112
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,340
are doing so if the arm is fine but they
 

113
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,850
are doing so if the arm is fine but they
weigh right here so that you don't feel

114
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:51,860
weigh right here so that you don't feel
 

115
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,860
weigh right here so that you don't feel
the weight this weight that way so you

116
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:56,870
the weight this weight that way so you
 

117
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,210
the weight this weight that way so you
go to here yeah I don't feel it then I

118
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,220
go to here yeah I don't feel it then I
 

119
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,530
go to here yeah I don't feel it then I
can't get so yes I'm going to give him

120
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:05,540
can't get so yes I'm going to give him
 

121
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,270
can't get so yes I'm going to give him
his X void but it's also why does my

122
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,280
his X void but it's also why does my
 

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,830
his X void but it's also why does my
hand keep coming back here

124
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840

 

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,879

no he keeps moving that way so I keep

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:18,889
no he keeps moving that way so I keep
 

127
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,439
no he keeps moving that way so I keep
letting it right and what's pushing it

128
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,449
letting it right and what's pushing it
 

129
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,270
letting it right and what's pushing it
his body so when we say a 10 Boyd or an

130
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,280
his body so when we say a 10 Boyd or an
 

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,909
his body so when we say a 10 Boyd or an
ex boy it can't just be on the arm and

132
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:30,919
ex boy it can't just be on the arm and
 

133
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,909
ex boy it can't just be on the arm and
then you this thing's moving towards you

134
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
then you this thing's moving towards you
 

135
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,320
then you this thing's moving towards you
you see this this grip is nothing more

136
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,330
you see this this grip is nothing more
 

137
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,000
you see this this grip is nothing more
than that Center everything comes back

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,010
than that Center everything comes back
 

139
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,040
than that Center everything comes back
to the center wherever it is matches

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,050
to the center wherever it is matches
 

141
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,439
to the center wherever it is matches
wherever I get the maximum reading of

142
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:44,449
wherever I get the maximum reading of
 

143
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,890
wherever I get the maximum reading of
his force that's where I decide to see

144
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:47,900
his force that's where I decide to see
 

145
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,409
his force that's where I decide to see
and that's why I move because I've

146
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,419
and that's why I move because I've
 

147
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:59,440
and that's why I move because I've
neutralized his maxim here's where you

148
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,450
neutralized his maxim here's where you
 

149
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,020
neutralized his maxim here's where you
stop and then oh man or your solution

150
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,030
stop and then oh man or your solution
 

151
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,840
stop and then oh man or your solution
out here then nothing so let him keep

152
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:07,850
out here then nothing so let him keep
 

153
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:15,670
out here then nothing so let him keep
pushing you oh then you can assist that

154
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
pushing you oh then you can assist that
 

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,100
pushing you oh then you can assist that
by going under it you see how it's

156
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,110
by going under it you see how it's
 

157
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,029
by going under it you see how it's
coming this way

158
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
coming this way
 

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:26,879
coming this way
so Jonathan I'm going to go under it not

160
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:26,889
so Jonathan I'm going to go under it not
