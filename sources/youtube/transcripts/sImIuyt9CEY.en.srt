00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
aido
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,270
aido
Kona you have the inward

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
Kona you have the inward
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,709
Kona you have the inward
spiral and then it's revers is your

8
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
spiral and then it's revers is your
 

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,310
spiral and then it's revers is your
outward

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:15,320

 

11
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,390

spiral although commonly done but not

12
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
spiral although commonly done but not
 

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,990
spiral although commonly done but not
correct you have

14
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,000
correct you have
 

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,990
correct you have
these um movements where you go in and

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
these um movements where you go in and
 

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,630
these um movements where you go in and
out horizontally

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
out horizontally
 

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,950
out horizontally
and then movements where you go up and

20
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
and then movements where you go up and
 

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,030
and then movements where you go up and
down and sometimes they try to get on

22
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,040
down and sometimes they try to get on
 

23
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,150
down and sometimes they try to get on
the center line so like for example the

24
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
the center line so like for example the
 

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,830
the center line so like for example the
up and down one you'll see people get to

26
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
up and down one you'll see people get to
 

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,190
up and down one you'll see people get to
a biomechanical efficiency you bring the

28
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
a biomechanical efficiency you bring the
 

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,350
a biomechanical efficiency you bring the
elbows in you're going to get more

30
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
elbows in you're going to get more
 

31
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,950
elbows in you're going to get more
leverage and then this hand goes like

32
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960

 

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,670

this

34
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
this
 

35
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,389
this
okay uh you see that stuff in the iwama

36
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
okay uh you see that stuff in the iwama
 

37
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,430
okay uh you see that stuff in the iwama
where you're always trying to overpower

38
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
where you're always trying to overpower
 

39
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,430
where you're always trying to overpower
someone or um mamoto he does that all

40
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,440
someone or um mamoto he does that all
 

41
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,390
someone or um mamoto he does that all
the time cha Sensei did that all the

42
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
the time cha Sensei did that all the
 

43
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,990
the time cha Sensei did that all the
time shabata Sensei and it's clearly

44
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,000
time shabata Sensei and it's clearly
 

45
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,670
time shabata Sensei and it's clearly
you're trying to overpower someone by

46
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
you're trying to overpower someone by
 

47
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,310
you're trying to overpower someone by
using um more leverage against the

48
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
using um more leverage against the
 

49
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,590
using um more leverage against the
person okay so an example of

50
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600

 

51
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,270

that uh let's say he does m so two hands

52
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
that uh let's say he does m so two hands
 

53
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,590
that uh let's say he does m so two hands
okay and then you know because you're

54
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:26,600
okay and then you know because you're
 

55
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,710
okay and then you know because you're
trying to feel powerful and make

56
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
trying to feel powerful and make
 

57
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,310
trying to feel powerful and make
yourself powerful you make him stay

58
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
yourself powerful you make him stay
 

59
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,310
yourself powerful you make him stay
still don't push in and stay in place

60
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,320
still don't push in and stay in place
 

61
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,109
still don't push in and stay in place
squeeze as hard as you can maybe even

62
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
squeeze as hard as you can maybe even
 

63
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,429
squeeze as hard as you can maybe even
lower your Center you know so he's here

64
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
lower your Center you know so he's here
 

65
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,310
lower your Center you know so he's here
like that and you're like oh oh I I and

66
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
like that and you're like oh oh I I and
 

67
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,069
like that and you're like oh oh I I and
then so then you'll see people will come

68
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,079
then so then you'll see people will come
 

69
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,830
then so then you'll see people will come
in you see and then they kind

70
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
in you see and then they kind
 

71
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,190
in you see and then they kind
of overpower him you

72
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
of overpower him you
 

73
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,389
of overpower him you
see to do the

74
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
see to do the
 

75
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,830
see to do the
technique okay make sense okay okay but

76
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
technique okay make sense okay okay but
 

77
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,630
technique okay make sense okay okay but
that's not iido because I shouldn't be

78
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
that's not iido because I shouldn't be
 

79
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,469
that's not iido because I shouldn't be
trying to overpower somebody okay that's

80
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:05,479
trying to overpower somebody okay that's
 

81
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,749
trying to overpower somebody okay that's
just ego tripartite mind will the power

82
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
just ego tripartite mind will the power
 

83
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,869
just ego tripartite mind will the power
and the fear cycle of behavior

84
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
and the fear cycle of behavior
 

85
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,390
and the fear cycle of behavior
okay um because it's still just a force

86
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:15,400
okay um because it's still just a force
 

87
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,110
okay um because it's still just a force
engine you see so if he comes over

88
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120

 

89
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,790

here and uh I grab him and he's going to

90
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,800
here and uh I grab him and he's going to
 

91
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,270
here and uh I grab him and he's going to
try to Anchor his

92
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
try to Anchor his
 

93
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,070
try to Anchor his
elbow and do that same leverage I let

94
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
elbow and do that same leverage I let
 

95
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,670
elbow and do that same leverage I let
try just try the

96
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
try just try the
 

97
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,309
try just try the
shape yep okay

98
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

99
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,910

so he can't get the engine there he

100
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
so he can't get the engine there he
 

101
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,670
so he can't get the engine there he
could move towards it no no

102
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
could move towards it no no
 

103
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,390
could move towards it no no
no you see now it's closer to his Center

104
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,400
no you see now it's closer to his Center
 

105
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,350
no you see now it's closer to his Center
and now you try it I'll let you try it

106
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,360
and now you try it I'll let you try it
 

107
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,190
and now you try it I'll let you try it
again so he moves good bring your elbow

108
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
again so he moves good bring your elbow
 

109
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,470
again so he moves good bring your elbow
in when you do it try again little slow

110
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
in when you do it try again little slow
 

111
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,670
in when you do it try again little slow
down I'm not going to resist the first

112
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
down I'm not going to resist the first
 

113
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,470
down I'm not going to resist the first
one

114
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
one
 

115
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,630
one
step bring your elbow to your Center and

116
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:03,640
step bring your elbow to your Center and
 

117
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,350
step bring your elbow to your Center and
then okay I'm not going to resist step

118
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
then okay I'm not going to resist step
 

119
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,149
then okay I'm not going to resist step
elbow to your Center there you go okay

120
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
elbow to your Center there you go okay
 

121
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,470
elbow to your Center there you go okay
so we do it

122
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:15,480

 

123
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,350

again it's not going to happen okay cuz

124
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360
again it's not going to happen okay cuz
 

125
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,910
again it's not going to happen okay cuz
it's just an engine trying to outow

126
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:20,920
it's just an engine trying to outow
 

127
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,110
it's just an engine trying to outow
another

128
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,120
another
 

129
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,470
another
engine okay um some of the things you

130
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
engine okay um some of the things you
 

131
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,990
engine okay um some of the things you
notice

132
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
notice
 

133
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,429
notice
though because people are attracted to

134
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
though because people are attracted to
 

135
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,670
though because people are attracted to
it because we love the delusion of outp

136
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,680
it because we love the delusion of outp
 

137
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,750
it because we love the delusion of outp
powering someone and then everything

138
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
powering someone and then everything
 

139
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,470
powering someone and then everything
will be okay if we could only outow

140
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,480
will be okay if we could only outow
 

141
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,789
will be okay if we could only outow
people um but some of the things you

142
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:43,799
people um but some of the things you
 

143
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,470
people um but some of the things you
notice is um I'm just standing there

144
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
notice is um I'm just standing there
 

145
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,190
notice is um I'm just standing there
waiting there's no

146
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,200
waiting there's no
 

147
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,190
waiting there's no
kazushi at all at contact he's got to

148
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
kazushi at all at contact he's got to
 

149
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,750
kazushi at all at contact he's got to
wait until I get out power do you see so

150
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:58,760
wait until I get out power do you see so
 

151
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,470
wait until I get out power do you see so
um

152
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
um
 

153
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,390
um
that's weird uh there's no energy really

154
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
that's weird uh there's no energy really
 

155
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,949

00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:22,759
grab what's he really doing
 

169
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,270
grab what's he really doing
martially we're just staming there

170
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
martially we're just staming there
 

171
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,710
martially we're just staming there
so again he grabbed really hard you

172
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
so again he grabbed really hard you
 

173
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,870
so again he grabbed really hard you
see nothing's going to happen I just

174
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
see nothing's going to happen I just
 

175
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,510
see nothing's going to happen I just
neutralized

176
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
neutralized
 

177
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,710
neutralized
everything it's not till he tries

178
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
everything it's not till he tries
 

179
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,749
everything it's not till he tries
something

180
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
something
 

181
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,469
something
else that something happens do you do

182
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
else that something happens do you do
 

183
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,629
else that something happens do you do
you get it in other words if we're just

184
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
you get it in other words if we're just
 

185
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,990
you get it in other words if we're just
here and I just squeeze

186
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,000
here and I just squeeze
 

187
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,150
here and I just squeeze
him is he's not being assaulted do you

188
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
him is he's not being assaulted do you
 

189
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,430
him is he's not being assaulted do you
see he kind of checked my weight but now

190
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,440
see he kind of checked my weight but now
 

191
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,950
see he kind of checked my weight but now
it's just squeezing at this

192
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:57,960

 

193
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,510

point you see it's stupid okay it

194
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:00,520
point you see it's stupid okay it
 

195
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,029
point you see it's stupid okay it
doesn't make martial

196
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:02,039
doesn't make martial
 

197
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,629
doesn't make martial
sense also being grabbed doesn't make

198
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
sense also being grabbed doesn't make
 

199
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,950
sense also being grabbed doesn't make
martial sense you

200
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:07,960
martial sense you
 

201
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,749
martial sense you
shouldn't you shouldn't feel martially

202
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
shouldn't you shouldn't feel martially
 

203
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,870
shouldn't you shouldn't feel martially
accomplished because you can get a

204
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
accomplished because you can get a
 

205
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,390
accomplished because you can get a
leverage

206
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
leverage
 

207
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,749
leverage
going because the Marshall question is

208
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
going because the Marshall question is
 

209
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,110
going because the Marshall question is
never let the guy grab you you shouldn't

210
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120
never let the guy grab you you shouldn't
 

211
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,950
never let the guy grab you you shouldn't
be where he could grab so it's not a

212
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:23,960
be where he could grab so it's not a
 

213
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,110
be where he could grab so it's not a
marshal question it's just the ego

214
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
marshal question it's just the ego
 

215
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,830
marshal question it's just the ego
tripartite mind satisfa

216
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:32,840

 

217
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,029

it's not

218
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
it's not
 

219
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,710
it's not
iido um so let's go into these

220
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
iido um so let's go into these
 

221
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,070
iido um so let's go into these
Spirals and look at

222
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
Spirals and look at
 

223
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,670
Spirals and look at
them a little more closely from the

224
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:46,680
them a little more closely from the
 

225
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,749
them a little more closely from the
three components okay really the first

226
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
three components okay really the first
 

227
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,110
three components okay really the first
component the physical component and

228
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
component the physical component and
 

229
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,830
component the physical component and
then the second component the energetic

230
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
then the second component the energetic
 

231
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,629
then the second component the energetic
component

232
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639

 

233
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,510

so

234
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,520
so
 

235
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,350
so
what we're going to

236
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,360
what we're going to
 

237
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,029
what we're going to
see at the physical

238
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
see at the physical
 

239
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,070
see at the physical
component is actually a superior Force

240
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
component is actually a superior Force
 

241
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,670
component is actually a superior Force
engine than that last one Al although it

242
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
engine than that last one Al although it
 

243
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,589
engine than that last one Al although it
can be strong it's really not that

244
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:14,599
can be strong it's really not that
 

245
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,670
can be strong it's really not that
strong in comparison okay um it uses

246
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
strong in comparison okay um it uses
 

247
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,990
strong in comparison okay um it uses
small muscle groups usually the biceps

248
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
small muscle groups usually the biceps
 

249
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,589
small muscle groups usually the biceps
and the deltoids those these are

250
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:24,599
and the deltoids those these are
 

251
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,510
and the deltoids those these are
terrible muscles to use in combat okay

252
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:28,520
terrible muscles to use in combat okay
 

253
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,990
terrible muscles to use in combat okay
and then we'll ALS also see

254
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,000
and then we'll ALS also see
 

255
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,710
and then we'll ALS also see
that um the lack of kazushi comes from

256
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:35,720
that um the lack of kazushi comes from
 

257
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,629
that um the lack of kazushi comes from
the fact that it usually only travels

258
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
the fact that it usually only travels
 

259
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,909
the fact that it usually only travels
through one or two Dimensions that other

260
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:40,919
through one or two Dimensions that other
 

261
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,110
through one or two Dimensions that other
hand workk whereas the spirals will

262
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
hand workk whereas the spirals will
 

263
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,350
hand workk whereas the spirals will
travel through three dimensions and

264
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
travel through three dimensions and
 

265
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,469
travel through three dimensions and
that's how you get the center moving and

266
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:47,479
that's how you get the center moving and
 

267
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,309
that's how you get the center moving and
things like that okay so if I have a

268
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
things like that okay so if I have a
 

269
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,390
things like that okay so if I have a
basketball and you look at these lines

270
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,400
basketball and you look at these lines
 

271
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,990
basketball and you look at these lines
that are going across if I'm moving my

272
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,000
that are going across if I'm moving my
 

273
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,350
that are going across if I'm moving my
arms like this and pay attention to the

274
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,360
arms like this and pay attention to the
 

275
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,390
arms like this and pay attention to the
like the equator line here okay it just

276
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,400
like the equator line here okay it just
 

277
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,550
like the equator line here okay it just
stays where it

278
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
stays where it
 

279
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,309
stays where it
is

280
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:09,319
is
 

281
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,790
is
okay but if I do the inward spiral

282
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
okay but if I do the inward spiral
 

283
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,749
okay but if I do the inward spiral
you'll see that the equator line started

284
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:14,759
you'll see that the equator line started
 

285
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,550
you'll see that the equator line started
to go forward you see okay so we're

286
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
to go forward you see okay so we're
 

287
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,950
to go forward you see okay so we're
here and uh let's say for

288
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:23,960
here and uh let's say for
 

289
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,070
here and uh let's say for
example I get to e you see and a lot of

290
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,080
example I get to e you see and a lot of
 

291
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,309
example I get to e you see and a lot of
people think that this

292
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
people think that this
 

293
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,990
people think that this
goes like this you see and nothing

294
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,000
goes like this you see and nothing
 

295
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,110
goes like this you see and nothing
happened to his body so that would be

296
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,120
happened to his body so that would be
 

297
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,270
happened to his body so that would be
similar

298
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
similar
 

299
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,830
similar
to I'm here and I just move it move it

300
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840
to I'm here and I just move it move it
 

301
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,589
to I'm here and I just move it move it
that way nothing happens to the equator

302
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:46,599
that way nothing happens to the equator
 

303
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,350
that way nothing happens to the equator
line

304
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
line
 

305
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,830
line
so so but if I do

306
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
so so but if I do
 

307
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,029
so so but if I do
the the hour spiral which isn't just my

308
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
the the hour spiral which isn't just my
 

309
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,790
the the hour spiral which isn't just my
hand and my elbow staying in the same

310
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:57,800
hand and my elbow staying in the same
 

311
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,469
hand and my elbow staying in the same
concentric Circle and moving out at my

312
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
concentric Circle and moving out at my
 

313
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,029
concentric Circle and moving out at my
shoulder but my elbow coming in you see

314
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:04,039
shoulder but my elbow coming in you see
 

315
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,670
shoulder but my elbow coming in you see
and you'll you'll feel the difference so

316
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
and you'll you'll feel the difference so
 

317
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,589
and you'll you'll feel the difference so
here nothing happens to

318
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
here nothing happens to
 

319
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,230
here nothing happens to
you I do the hour spiral and you'll

320
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,240
you I do the hour spiral and you'll
 

321
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,629
you I do the hour spiral and you'll
see his Center gets touched gets moved

322
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:15,639
see his Center gets touched gets moved
 

323
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,670
see his Center gets touched gets moved
okay obviously on the inward spiral you

324
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:18,680
okay obviously on the inward spiral you
 

325
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,990
okay obviously on the inward spiral you
can see that his Center gets

326
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,000
can see that his Center gets
 

327
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,270
can see that his Center gets
moved as opposed to I'm just make this

328
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
moved as opposed to I'm just make this
 

329
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,430
moved as opposed to I'm just make this
circle see so here's here's my

330
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
circle see so here's here's my
 

331
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,469
circle see so here's here's my
circle

332
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:31,479

 

333
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,029

a

334
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039

Road mudra theories okay Chris come so

412
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
Road mudra theories okay Chris come so
 

413
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,829
Road mudra theories okay Chris come so
you can

414
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
you can
 

415
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,030
you can
see and it's different from Modern iido

416
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
see and it's different from Modern iido
 

417
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,030
see and it's different from Modern iido
because modern iido looks at things

418
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
because modern iido looks at things
 

419
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,230
because modern iido looks at things
mechanically superficially materially

420
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
mechanically superficially materially
 

421
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,790
mechanically superficially materially
and so they at best get biomechanics

422
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:33,800
and so they at best get biomechanics
 

423
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,350
and so they at best get biomechanics
going and so um they will feel Superior

424
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
going and so um they will feel Superior
 

425
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,870
going and so um they will feel Superior

your Center Line because obviously the

428
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,040
your Center Line because obviously the
 

429
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,910
your Center Line because obviously the
more peripheral you are to the center

430
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
more peripheral you are to the center
 

431
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,750
more peripheral you are to the center
line the more deltoid and I already said

432
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:46,760
line the more deltoid and I already said
 

433
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,629
line the more deltoid and I already said
that's a weak muscle group to use so

434
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:48,639
that's a weak muscle group to use so
 

435
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,230
that's a weak muscle group to use so
they'll try to come near the center line

436
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,240
they'll try to come near the center line
 

437
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,710
they'll try to come near the center line
just as I've described in the previous

438
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
just as I've described in the previous
 

439
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,910
just as I've described in the previous
technique and that does bring some

440
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:56,920
technique and that does bring some
 

441
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,870
technique and that does bring some
biomechanical soundness to it

442
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
biomechanical soundness to it
 

443
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,150
biomechanical soundness to it
um but

444
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
um but
 

445
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,069
um but
energetically um it's denying a bunch of

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
energetically um it's denying a bunch of
 

447
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,550
energetically um it's denying a bunch of

456
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200

457
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,509
hands I move my hands to move my Center
is the proper way okay and it goes back

458
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:24,519
is the proper way okay and it goes back
 

459
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,470
is the proper way okay and it goes back
to the mudra Theory okay

460
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:27,480
to the mudra Theory okay
 

461
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,710
to the mudra Theory okay
so uh and I'll do this this kind of in

462
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:31,720
so uh and I'll do this this kind of in
 

463
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,990
so uh and I'll do this this kind of in
Reverse

464
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,000

465
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,509
Reverse
fashion so I have my lower

466
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:36,519
fashion so I have my lower
 

467
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,269
fashion so I have my lower
tanden and I use hand gestures to

468
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:42,279

move the Yang and Yin that constitute

470
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:47,720
move the Yang and Yin that constitute
 

471
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,110

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
the lower ton dent I don't I don't move
 

473
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,949
the lower ton dent I don't I don't move
my body to move my hands okay it's

474
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:55,959
my body to move my hands okay it's
 

475
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,509
my body to move my hands okay it's
reverse and so if you are and what

476
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
reverse and so if you are and what
 

477
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,389
reverse and so if you are and what
you're trying to do with the yangong and

478
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
you're trying to do with the yangong and
 

479
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,790
you're trying to do with the yangong and
Yin in your lower tonen is spiral rotate

480
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:05,800
Yin in your lower tonen is spiral rotate
 

481
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,350
Yin in your lower tonen is spiral rotate
them now add to that that my hands move

482
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
them now add to that that my hands move
 

483
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,230
them now add to that that my hands move
my lower ton Den therefore my hands must

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:16,760
spiral rotate therefore they must travel
 

487
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,110
spiral rotate therefore they must travel

elevation then my hands have to move in
an inward spiral that goes up and that's

502
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
an inward spiral that goes up and that's
 

503
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,949
an inward spiral that goes up and that's
where we're going to go

504
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
where we're going to go
 

505
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,269
where we're going to go
okay to start though you have to know

506
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
okay to start though you have to know
 

507
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,150
okay to start though you have to know
how to form

508
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,160
how to form
 

509
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,550
how to form
Lon

510
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:51,560
Lon
 

511
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,629
Lon
so I'm going to try to describe it to

512
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
so I'm going to try to describe it to

best um upic
advice is that you just use these tips

518
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,120
advice is that you just use these tips
 

519
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,389
advice is that you just use these tips
to get in the ballpark and then you just

520
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:07,399
to get in the ballpark and then you just
 

521
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,629
to get in the ballpark and then you just
struggle and struggle and struggle until

522
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:09,639
struggle and struggle and struggle until
 

523
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,470
struggle and struggle and struggle until
you feel something outside of your

524
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
you feel something outside of your
 

525
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,310
you feel something outside of your
intention okay because your intention is

526
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,320
intention okay because your intention is
 

527
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,030
intention okay because your intention is
getting in the way so some of the things

528
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,040
getting in the way so some of the things
 

529
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,030
getting in the way so some of the things
will start with what it's not it's not a

530
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,040
will start with what it's not it's not a
 

531
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,310
will start with what it's not it's not a
dead hand it's not it's not

532
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,320
dead hand it's not it's not
 

533
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,509
dead hand it's not it's not
relaxed and you're now a wet noodle it's

534
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
relaxed and you're now a wet noodle it's
 

535
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,949
relaxed and you're now a wet noodle it's
not that it's also not this what people

536
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
not that it's also not this what people
 

537
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,949
not that it's also not this what people
have come to mean as iido that's not it

538
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
have come to mean as iido that's not it
 

539
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,910
have come to mean as iido that's not it
either

540
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:36,920
either
 

541
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,829
either
okay um it's not finger tension and it's

542
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:40,839
okay um it's not finger tension and it's
 

543
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,470
okay um it's not finger tension and it's
not forearm tension so think about that

544
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
not forearm tension so think about that
 

545
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,030
not forearm tension so think about that
there's there shouldn't be tension in

546
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,040
there's there shouldn't be tension in
 

547
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,030
there's there shouldn't be tension in
your forearm which there always is if

548
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,040
your forearm which there always is if
 

549
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,069
your forearm which there always is if
you do

550
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:49,079
you do
 

551
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,110
you do
that yoshinon iido hand there's tension

552
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
that yoshinon iido hand there's tension
 

553
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,350
that yoshinon iido hand there's tension
in the form you can see it okay so don't

554
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
in the form you can see it okay so don't
 

555
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,189
in the form you can see it okay so don't
flex this don't try to flex your fingers

556
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
flex this don't try to flex your fingers
 

557
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,069
flex this don't try to flex your fingers
because you'll

558
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:03,079
because you'll
 

559
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,150
because you'll
you'll also Flex that forearm to do that

560
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
you'll also Flex that forearm to do that
 

561
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,230
you'll also Flex that forearm to do that
okay what I would like you to do is

562
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
okay what I would like you to do is
 

563
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,189
okay what I would like you to do is
instead uh expand the bones in your

564
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
instead uh expand the bones in your
 

565
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,990
instead uh expand the bones in your
hand what happens to your fingers and

566
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
hand what happens to your fingers and
 

567
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,069
hand what happens to your fingers and
what happens to your forarm is

568
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
what happens to your forarm is
 

569
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,629
what happens to your forarm is
irrelevant so I expand the bones in my

570
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:25,639
irrelevant so I expand the bones in my
 

571
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,629
irrelevant so I expand the bones in my
hand until I start feeling the fingers

572
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:29,639
hand until I start feeling the fingers
 

573
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,389
hand until I start feeling the fingers
flex and the forearm Flex don't go past

574
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
flex and the forearm Flex don't go past
 

575
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,189
flex and the forearm Flex don't go past
that okay so try try this I expand the

576
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:38,199
that okay so try try this I expand the
 

577
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,790
that okay so try try this I expand the
metacarpal these bones until I feel the

578
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
metacarpal these bones until I feel the
 

579
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,389
metacarpal these bones until I feel the
forearm FL too much

580
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:47,399

 

581
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,550

okay so I I have some parameters like

582
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:51,560
okay so I I have some parameters like
 

583
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,069
okay so I I have some parameters like
too little not expanding the

584
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
too little not expanding the
 

585
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,069
too little not expanding the
metacarpal tension tension too much

586
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,079

 

587
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,230

okay then the next upaya tip I would

588
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
okay then the next upaya tip I would
 

589
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,110
okay then the next upaya tip I would
like to give you is if you're doing this

591
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,949
like to give you is if you're doing this
right there'll be a hollow oness in

592
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
right there'll be a hollow oness in
 

593
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,749
right there'll be a hollow oness in
here like you could put water in there

594
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:15,759
here like you could put water in there
 

595
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,949
here like you could put water in there
it would hold there but I don't want to

596
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
it would hold there but I don't want to
 

597
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,509
it would hold there but I don't want to
shape it do you

598
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
shape it do you
 

599
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,710
shape it do you
see that's what a lot of people make

600
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
see that's what a lot of people make
 

601
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,949
see that's what a lot of people make
that mistake they're like oh it's like a

a cup well no because you're now you're
 

605
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,629
a cup well no because you're now you're
metacarpal are not

606
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
metacarpal are not
 

607
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,189
metacarpal are not
expanding do you guys get it okay so I

608
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
expanding do you guys get it okay so I
 

609
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,509
expanding do you guys get it okay so I
have to expand the metacarpal these

610
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
have to expand the metacarpal these
 

611
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,949
have to expand the metacarpal these
bones through the

612
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
bones through the
 

613
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,550
bones through the
hand without tension here without

614
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
hand without tension here without
 

615
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,990
hand without tension here without
tension

616
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,000
tension
 

617
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,509
tension
here and I should have a cup shape

618
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519

 

619
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,670

some things that can start to happen

626
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:01,399
some things that can start to happen

charge that runs down the middle
 

631
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,910
charge that runs down the middle
finger along the

633
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,269
finger along the
sides I don't want to describe it past

634
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:12,279
sides I don't want to describe it past

that okay and you'll have some
sense uh of expansion and

638
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
sense uh of expansion and
 

639
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,430
sense uh of expansion and
extension through that middle

640
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
extension through that middle
 

641
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,269
extension through that middle
finger

642
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
finger
 

643
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,910
finger

index finger which is also not well
 

651
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,910
index finger which is also not well
understood and but I I don't want to

652
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:38,920
understood and but I I don't want to
 

653
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,829
understood and but I I don't want to
make more of it because I don't I don't

when you feel them charge in the middle
finger you'll see that it comes out of

660
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240
finger you'll see that it comes out of
 

661
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,870
finger you'll see that it comes out of
alignment with the index finger which

662
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:51,880
alignment with the index finger which
 

663
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,949
alignment with the index finger which

other you can pull apart you don't feel
 

721
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,750
other you can pull apart you don't feel
it and you after you get good at it you

722
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:28,760
it and you after you get good at it you
 

723
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:39,590
it and you after you get good at it you
you can feel it from pretty far

724
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600

 

725
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,190

away and all we're learning

726
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
away and all we're learning
 

727
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:57,710
away and all we're learning
here is how to activate L

728
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:57,720

 

729
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,870

go

730
00:18:59,870 --> 00:18:59,880
go
 

731
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,350
go
you can coordinate it with your

732
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:04,360

 

733
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:23,430

breath but you don't need

734
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440

 

735
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,870

to so that

736
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
to so that
 

737
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,270
to so that
activated aspect

738
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
activated aspect
 

739
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,390
activated aspect
is what you do in your inward spiral and

740
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,400
is what you do in your inward spiral and
 

741
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,750
is what you do in your inward spiral and
your outward spiral you never let it go

742
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
your outward spiral you never let it go
 

743
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,510
your outward spiral you never let it go
dead doesn't go dead

744
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
dead doesn't go dead
 

745
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,669
dead doesn't go dead
okay all right let's get to the shapes

746
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:46,679

 

747
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,750

now as there's only two

748
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
now as there's only two
 

749
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,270
now as there's only two
Spirals and there's three levels jodon

750
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
Spirals and there's three levels jodon
 

751
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,350
Spirals and there's three levels jodon
Chon and

752
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,360

 

753
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,110

gon those three levels are is

754
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,120
gon those three levels are is
 

755
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,750
gon those three levels are is
different points in either of the two

756
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
different points in either of the two
 

757
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,669
different points in either of the two
spirals okay so for example if I want to

758
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:08,679
spirals okay so for example if I want to
 

759
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,390
spirals okay so for example if I want to
go to the lower level of gon I don't

760
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,400
go to the lower level of gon I don't
 

761
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,510
go to the lower level of gon I don't
pull my hand down like this I'm in one

762
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
pull my hand down like this I'm in one
 

763
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,990
pull my hand down like this I'm in one
dimension okay is it is there a way of

764
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,000
dimension okay is it is there a way of
 

765
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,190
dimension okay is it is there a way of
getting leverage yeah yes but it's

766
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
getting leverage yeah yes but it's
 

767
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,669
getting leverage yeah yes but it's
mechanical leverage again so if he is

768
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:22,679
mechanical leverage again so if he is
 

769
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,149
mechanical leverage again so if he is
stronger than mean he's lifting up I

770
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:25,159
stronger than mean he's lifting up I
 

771
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,230
stronger than mean he's lifting up I
can't get that you'll try your tricks

772
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,240
can't get that you'll try your tricks
 

773
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,750
can't get that you'll try your tricks
you know to get down there but again his

774
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
you know to get down there but again his
 

775
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,310
you know to get down there but again his
Center is not moving okay and more

776
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
Center is not moving okay and more
 

777
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,990
Center is not moving okay and more
importantly my Center is not moving

778
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
importantly my Center is not moving
 

779
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,549
importantly my Center is not moving
okay so to get to the lower

780
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
okay so to get to the lower
 

781
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,149
okay so to get to the lower
level you are going to start the outward

782
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:45,159
level you are going to start the outward
 

783
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,430
level you are going to start the outward
spiral the water spiral

784
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440

 

785
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,350

okay and he'll feel a couple things so

786
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,360
okay and he'll feel a couple things so
 

787
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,070
okay and he'll feel a couple things so
for example you can't push cuz it's

788
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
for example you can't push cuz it's
 

789
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,430
for example you can't push cuz it's
pressing on his Center okay

790
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:00,440
pressing on his Center okay
 

791
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,070
pressing on his Center okay
um if he and once I start it let's say

792
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
um if he and once I start it let's say
 

793
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,149
um if he and once I start it let's say
he's pulling now do you see you're going

794
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:07,159
he's pulling now do you see you're going
 

795
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,549
he's pulling now do you see you're going
to change the angle of his pull so at

796
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:09,559
to change the angle of his pull so at
 

797
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,510
to change the angle of his pull so at
the physical component you're going to

798
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
the physical component you're going to
 

799
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,470
the physical component you're going to
change the angle of this pull so if you

800
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,480
change the angle of this pull so if you
 

801
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,230
change the angle of this pull so if you
look his elbow is trying to go back this

802
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
look his elbow is trying to go back this
 

803
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,590
look his elbow is trying to go back this
way and you're going to turn his elbow

804
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:18,600
way and you're going to turn his elbow
 

805
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,950
way and you're going to turn his elbow
out of position you see as you drop

806
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:21,960
out of position you see as you drop
 

807
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,669
out of position you see as you drop
it so laong home and you can see his

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:26,679
it so laong home and you can see his
 

809
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,789
it so laong home and you can see his

body okay let's try that

836
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480

841
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,950
field
what modern iido think of your Center

842
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
what modern iido think of your Center
 

843
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,230
what modern iido think of your Center
this biomechanical point in your body

844
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,240
this biomechanical point in your body
 

845
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,110
this biomechanical point in your body
that is moved by the

846
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,120
that is moved by the
 

847
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,669
that is moved by the
qua so my hand my quaw doesn't stay here

848
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:44,679
qua so my hand my quaw doesn't stay here
 

849
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,190
qua so my hand my quaw doesn't stay here
and then I try to do this shape because

850
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
and then I try to do this shape because
 

851
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,789
and then I try to do this shape because
I can't get over there if I turn my qua

852
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799
I can't get over there if I turn my qua
 

853
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,269
I can't get over there if I turn my qua
you can see how much more I can move

854
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:53,279
you can see how much more I can move
 

855
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,590
you can see how much more I can move
that

856
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
that
 

857
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,750
that
okay also we already talked about as the

858
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:58,760
okay also we already talked about as the
 

859
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,909
okay also we already talked about as the
qua releases on one side and presses

860
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
qua releases on one side and presses
 

861
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,110
qua releases on one side and presses
through on the other side so too does

862
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,120
through on the other side so too does
 

863
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,990
through on the other side so too does
this shoulder of that same side so when

864
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,000
this shoulder of that same side so when
 

865
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,310
this shoulder of that same side so when
I'm here like this it'll release the qua

866
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm here like this it'll release the qua
 

867
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,149
I'm here like this it'll release the qua
but leave my shoulder

868
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:11,159
but leave my shoulder
 

869
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,470
but leave my shoulder
here uh you get all twisted

870
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
here uh you get all twisted
 

871
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,350
here uh you get all twisted
up so here in this case he's pushing in

872
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,360
up so here in this case he's pushing in
 

873
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,190
up so here in this case he's pushing in
the last case he was pulling um you you

874
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,200
the last case he was pulling um you you
 

875
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,710
the last case he was pulling um you you
will release you see you release you

876
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:25,720
will release you see you release you
 

877
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,070
will release you see you release you
move in and then you move back

878
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080

 

879
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,830

okay uh so remember to do that don't

880
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
okay uh so remember to do that don't
 

881
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,590
okay uh so remember to do that don't
keep your quad still don't keep your

882
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:36,600
keep your quad still don't keep your
 

883
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,430
keep your quad still don't keep your
shoulders

884
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,440
shoulders
 

885
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,230
shoulders
locked um this spiral is going back to

886
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,240
locked um this spiral is going back to
 

887
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,230
locked um this spiral is going back to
the energetics and doing and doing what

888
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,240
the energetics and doing and doing what
 

889
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,350
the energetics and doing and doing what
I'm doing on the tonden field I'm

890
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
I'm doing on the tonden field I'm
 

891
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,430
I'm doing on the tonden field I'm
turning it scooping it and then over the

892
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
turning it scooping it and then over the
 

893
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,510
turning it scooping it and then over the
top moving it this way I think you guys

894
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:56,520
top moving it this way I think you guys
 

895
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,590
top moving it this way I think you guys
are picturing cuz their head is here and

896
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
are picturing cuz their head is here and
 

897
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,950
are picturing cuz their head is here and
you're like just moving now in a

898
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
you're like just moving now in a
 

899
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,830
you're like just moving now in a
circle okay so I'm going to just to stay

900
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:06,840
circle okay so I'm going to just to stay
 

901
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,190
circle okay so I'm going to just to stay
with the ball I'm going to change the

902
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,200
with the ball I'm going to change the
 

903
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,190
with the ball I'm going to change the
shape of my arm so don't freak out okay

904
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
shape of my arm so don't freak out okay
 

905
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,710
shape of my arm so don't freak out okay
so here's the qual yield and the

906
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:13,720
so here's the qual yield and the
 

907
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,669
so here's the qual yield and the
shoulder

908
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:14,679
shoulder
 

909
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,110
shoulder
yield right I'm going to come under back

910
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120
yield right I'm going to come under back
 

911
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,590
yield right I'm going to come under back
this way you see I'm going to come over

912
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
this way you see I'm going to come over
 

913
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,230
this way you see I'm going to come over
the top this way and then I'm moving it

914
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
the top this way and then I'm moving it
 

915
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,350
the top this way and then I'm moving it
this way this is what I'm

916
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
this way this is what I'm
 

917
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,230
this way this is what I'm
doing over the top it's the inside of

918
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,240
doing over the top it's the inside of
 

919
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,389
doing over the top it's the inside of
the arm because of where La gong is

920
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:33,399
the arm because of where La gong is
 

921
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,870
the arm because of where La gong is
facing that's moving the top it's not

922
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
facing that's moving the top it's not
 

923
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,190
facing that's moving the top it's not
the outside of my arm and I just knock

924
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
the outside of my arm and I just knock
 

925
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,870
the outside of my arm and I just knock
him over

926
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880

 

927
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,310

okay so you'll look for those things now

928
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
okay so you'll look for those things now
 

929
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,630
okay so you'll look for those things now
okay and we can have them pushing again

930
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
okay and we can have them pushing again
 

931
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,029
okay and we can have them pushing again
so he's pushing them okay so

932
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039

 

933
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,310

for

way
 

939
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,990
way
don't go here and here's that Circle

940
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
don't go here and here's that Circle
 

941
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,190
don't go here and here's that Circle
your outer deltoid is going to be here

942
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,200
your outer deltoid is going to be here
 

943
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,669
your outer deltoid is going to be here
okay

944
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:14,679
okay
 

945
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,750
okay
no spin it picture here forget him

that basketball here it's inside my body

950
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
that basketball here it's inside my body
 

951
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,350
that basketball here it's inside my body
you can see me scooping

952
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,360
you can see me scooping
 

953
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,350
you can see me scooping
it drawing it on this

954
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
it drawing it on this
 

955
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,950
it drawing it on this
top you can see the middle finger on the

956
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:33,960
top you can see the middle finger on the
 

957
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,909
top you can see the middle finger on the
on the L

958
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:36,919

 

959
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,830

gong okay and he becomes irrelevant like

960
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
gong okay and he becomes irrelevant like
 

961
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,710
gong okay and he becomes irrelevant like
he feels like nothing but my mind's not

962
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
he feels like nothing but my mind's not
 

963
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,830
he feels like nothing but my mind's not
even on him or anything but I'm feeling

964
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:44,840
even on him or anything but I'm feeling
 

965
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,389
even on him or anything but I'm feeling
all of this stuff okay let's try it

966
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:49,399

 

967
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,389

again okay so uh again if you have

968
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:53,399
again okay so uh again if you have
 

969
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,230
again okay so uh again if you have
someone stronger than you the The

970
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,240
someone stronger than you the The
 

971
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,750
someone stronger than you the The
Leverage stuff is not going to work okay

972
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
Leverage stuff is not going to work okay
 

973
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,830
Leverage stuff is not going to work okay
so we have two

974
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
so we have two
 

975
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,830
so we have two
people and you're gripping and you're

976
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
people and you're gripping and you're
 

977
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,470
people and you're gripping and you're
gripping and they're holding me this is

978
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,480
gripping and they're holding me this is
 

979
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,789
gripping and they're holding me this is
going to be very hard to do you see and

980
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
going to be very hard to do you see and
 

981
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,470
going to be very hard to do you see and
also nothing's nothing's moving them

982
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:15,480
also nothing's nothing's moving them
 

983
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,149
also nothing's nothing's moving them
okay what what I'm going to do

984
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
okay what what I'm going to do
 

985
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,590
okay what what I'm going to do
instead is move my lower T end field the

986
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:22,600
instead is move my lower T end field the
 

987
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,149
instead is move my lower T end field the
same exact way there's the qua yield and

988
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:25,159
same exact way there's the qua yield and
 

989
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,149
same exact way there's the qua yield and
the shoulder yield boom move it

990
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:29,159
the shoulder yield boom move it
 

991
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,710
the shoulder yield boom move it
move

992
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
move
 

993
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:39,430
move
it I'll hold more lost ground

994
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440

 

995
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,590

Vector you can see how hard they're

996
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
Vector you can see how hard they're

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
enough friction I can't even do
 

1339
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:26,150
enough friction I can't even do
that instead I'm turning my Center

1340
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160

 

1341
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,589

oh when you you do a strong enough

1342
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:30,599
oh when you you do a strong enough
 

1343
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,030
oh when you you do a strong enough
Chon a lot of times you don't I would

1344
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,040
Chon a lot of times you don't I would
 

1345
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,990
Chon a lot of times you don't I would
say probably all the time you don't

1346
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
say probably all the time you don't
 

1347
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,910
say probably all the time you don't
actually lift the Hound he ends up

1348
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:38,920
actually lift the Hound he ends up
 

1349
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,829
actually lift the Hound he ends up
lifting the Hound okay so if you pay

1350
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:42,839
lifting the Hound okay so if you pay
 

1351
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,630
lifting the Hound okay so if you pay
attention you see his hand is lifting

1352
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
attention you see his hand is lifting
 

1353
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,910
attention you see his hand is lifting
it not me trying to lift my

1354
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:50,920
it not me trying to lift my
 

1355
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,030
it not me trying to lift my
hand as as his balance goes give little

1356
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
hand as as his balance goes give little
 

1357
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,750
hand as as his balance goes give little
energy okay lot of energy give a lot of

1358
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:57,760
energy okay lot of energy give a lot of
 

1359
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,550
energy okay lot of energy give a lot of
energy okay all right so as I come

1360
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,560
energy okay all right so as I come
 

1361
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,550
energy okay all right so as I come
around that energy is being weighted by

1362
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
around that energy is being weighted by
 

1363
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,790
around that energy is being weighted by
the gon and as I go to the Chon Chon it

1364
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,800
the gon and as I go to the Chon Chon it
 

1365
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,150
the gon and as I go to the Chon Chon it
picks it up do you

1366
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160

 

1367
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,990

see so again lots of energy okay right

1368
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
see so again lots of energy okay right
 

1369
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,550
see so again lots of energy okay right
now I'm on top of that energy so I'm

1370
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:20,560
now I'm on top of that energy so I'm
 

1371
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,270
now I'm on top of that energy so I'm
going to get out of the way of it with

1372
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,280
going to get out of the way of it with
 

1373
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,430
going to get out of the way of it with
the chew on it comes up on its

1374
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:26,440

 

1375
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,790

own

1376
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:31,800

 

1377
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,990

that's different don't get the same

1378
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
that's different don't get the same
 

1379
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,430
that's different don't get the same
kazushi don't get the same angle

1380
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,440
kazushi don't get the same angle
 

1381
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,069
kazushi don't get the same angle
cancellation here

1382
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:39,079
cancellation here
 

1383
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,109
cancellation here
and he's not even falling that way

1384
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
and he's not even falling that way
 

1385
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,990
and he's not even falling that way
energy iner is not going that way so

1386
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
energy iner is not going that way so
 

1387
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,870
energy iner is not going that way so
lots of energy this thing goes here

1388
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880

 

1389
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,000

boom okay
