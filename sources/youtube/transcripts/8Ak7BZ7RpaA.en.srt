and he's going to be moving to do his
 

145
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,670
and he's going to be moving to do his
angle deviation okay right so his angle

146
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680
angle deviation okay right so his angle
 

147
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,270
angle deviation okay right so his angle
deviation is makos there it is right

148
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
deviation is makos there it is right
 

149
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,189
deviation is makos there it is right
there come back and so as I see him move

150
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
there come back and so as I see him move

because it's more of a conclusion I

256
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:53,640
because it's more of a conclusion I

267
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,670
the same type of strategy that the Joe's
been using from the beginning which is

uh well I don't there it doesn't make
 

273
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,870
uh well I don't there it doesn't make
any sense that all of a sudden it worked

274
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
any sense that all of a sudden it worked
 

275
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,310
any sense that all of a sudden it worked
you see it doesn't make sense that that

276
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
you see it doesn't make sense that that
 

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,590
you see it doesn't make sense that that
would be the ending so Suka at uh is

would be the ending so Suka at uh is
 

279
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,710
would be the ending so Suka at uh is
more of an ending that makes sense to me

280
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:29,720
more of an ending that makes sense to me
 

281
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,550
more of an ending that makes sense to me
uh because what it does is the guy made

282
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,560
uh because what it does is the guy made

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,990
uh because what it does is the guy made
the mistake by leaving underneath open

284
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
the mistake by leaving underneath open

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,350
or artifactual weapons they now have the
opportunity to close and use that

292
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
opportunity to close and use that
 

293
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,829
opportunity to close and use that
shorter range weapon and that ends the

294
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839
shorter range weapon and that ends the
 

295
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,630
shorter range weapon and that ends the
the whole thing that they're trying to

296

the whole thing that they're trying to
 

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,470
the whole thing that they're trying to

337
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:40,389

for

338
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399

 

339
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,990

all right all right so uh we're not

340
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,000
all right all right so uh we're not
 

341
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,910
all right all right so uh we're not
going to break down um the Kessa or the

342
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
going to break down um the Kessa or the
 

343
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,110
going to break down um the Kessa or the
um OSI Zuki or theuk because we have

344
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
um OSI Zuki or theuk because we have
 

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,389
um OSI Zuki or theuk because we have
lots of videos on that and I think the

346
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
lots of videos on that and I think the
 

347
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,990
lots of videos on that and I think the
overall strategy the stickiness all the

348
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,000
overall strategy the stickiness all the
 

349
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,190
overall strategy the stickiness all the
the things that we mentioned uh leading

350
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
the things that we mentioned uh leading
 

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,509
the things that we mentioned uh leading
up to these moves you can see that

352
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
up to these moves you can see that
 

353
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,910
up to these moves you can see that
they're exactly the same okay so we'll

354
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
they're exactly the same okay so we'll
 

355
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,509
they're exactly the same okay so we'll
stop there that's our intro into soncho

356
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:08,519
stop there that's our intro into soncho
 

357
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,790
stop there that's our intro into soncho
31 and then we will continue to refine

358
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:11,800
31 and then we will continue to refine
 

359
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,710
31 and then we will continue to refine
it and what we're looking for in our

360
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
it and what we're looking for in our
 

361
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,949
it and what we're looking for in our
refinement is that our circles the

362
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
refinement is that our circles the
 

363
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,470
refinement is that our circles the
rotating spiral rotating crosses are

364
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,480
rotating spiral rotating crosses are
 

365
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,230
rotating spiral rotating crosses are
extremely tiny they're very tiny on both

366
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
extremely tiny they're very tiny on both
 

367
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,389
extremely tiny they're very tiny on both
sides okay and so as my people get

368
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
sides okay and so as my people get
 

369
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,829
sides okay and so as my people get
better at this form you're going to see

370
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:26,839
better at this form you're going to see
 

371
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,310
better at this form you're going to see
uh you'll see this version in it but

372
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,320
uh you'll see this version in it but
 

373
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,509
uh you'll see this version in it but
you'll also Go whoo it looks totally

374
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
you'll also Go whoo it looks totally
 

375
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,110
you'll also Go whoo it looks totally
different now um that's our goal here

376
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,120
different now um that's our goal here
 

377
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,399
different now um that's our goal here
all right thank you
