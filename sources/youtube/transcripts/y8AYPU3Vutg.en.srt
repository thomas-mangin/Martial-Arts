like that now so I don't know why we
 

69
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,740
like that now so I don't know why we
have those so the first first thing to

70
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:21,750
have those so the first first thing to
 

71
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,859
have those so the first first thing to
understand is these are weapon oriented

72
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:24,869
understand is these are weapon oriented
 

73
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,740

large leaping attack so if josh is
 

191
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,449
large leaping attack so if josh is
always keeping his distance his idea

192
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:21,459
always keeping his distance his idea
 

193
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,610
always keeping his distance his idea
isn't to get me then that large leaping

194
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:23,620
isn't to get me then that large leaping
 

195
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,470
isn't to get me then that large leaping
distance is what's gonna set up the ski

action all right now that we're

198
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
action all right now that we're
 

199
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,259
action all right now that we're
understanding the distance we can

200
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:28,269
understanding the distance we can
 

201
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,880
understanding the distance we can
understand why also we wouldn't have

202
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:29,890
understand why also we wouldn't have
 

203
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,430
understand why also we wouldn't have

he's very far away from me and Ike you

278
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,300
he's very far away from me and Ike you
 

279

him if they set into position we
 

285
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,150
him if they set into position we
immediately move away that means he

286
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
immediately move away that means he
 

287
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,010
immediately move away that means he
can't be in this comfortable boxing
