going to be on i can't take them down so
 

15
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:17,990
going to be on i can't take them down so
i'm

16
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
i'm
 

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,590
i'm
i'm trying all my tricks to get them

18
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
i'm trying all my tricks to get them
 

19
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,590
i'm trying all my tricks to get them
down and they won't go down what do i do

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
down and they won't go down what do i do
 

21
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,830
down and they won't go down what do i do
after that and so this looks at the the

22
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
after that and so this looks at the the
 

23
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,150
after that and so this looks at the the
controls that happen immediately after

24
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
controls that happen immediately after
 

25
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,670
controls that happen immediately after
and also the escapes a little bit what

26
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
and also the escapes a little bit what
 

27
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,269
and also the escapes a little bit what
happened immediately after

28
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
happened immediately after
 

29
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,310

can talk about how the urowaza variation
and lots of things go into there but

108
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
and lots of things go into there but
 

109
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,870
and lots of things go into there but

now there's lots of things about the

196
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
now there's lots of things about the
 

197
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,190
now there's lots of things about the
nico and we get to the chondru and

198
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
nico and we get to the chondru and
 

199
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,470
nico and we get to the chondru and
fornica we'll talk about all the little

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
fornica we'll talk about all the little
 

201
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,229
fornica we'll talk about all the little
adaptations but understand that if i

202
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
adaptations but understand that if i
 

203
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,470
adaptations but understand that if i
can't get this guy down i can adjust my

can't get this guy down i can adjust my
 

205
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,710
can't get this guy down i can adjust my
grip here and then let him come up

206
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
grip here and then let him come up
 

207
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,390
grip here and then let him come up
essentially and he won't want to because

213
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,390
the nikkyo and rolls forward to get away
from the nikki i can then drive down we

okay now let's say this guy can stand up

248
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
okay now let's say this guy can stand up
 

249
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,190
okay now let's say this guy can stand up
all the way so he stands up boom all the

250
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
all the way so he stands up boom all the
 

251
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,509
all the way so he stands up boom all the
way my nico's not strong enough to hold

252
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
way my nico's not strong enough to hold
 

253
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,869
way my nico's not strong enough to hold
him here and i didn't get to place it

254
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
him here and i didn't get to place it
 

255
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,030
him here and i didn't get to place it
against my body to lock myself down so i

256
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
against my body to lock myself down so i
 

257
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,589
against my body to lock myself down so i
got into a bad position so as he comes

258
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
got into a bad position so as he comes
 

259
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,149
got into a bad position so as he comes
up i can transition into sankyo right

260
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
up i can transition into sankyo right
 

261
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,990
up i can transition into sankyo right
now look this isn't i'm not trying to

262
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
now look this isn't i'm not trying to
 

263
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,509
now look this isn't i'm not trying to
hold this all day this is not my super

264
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
hold this all day this is not my super
 

265
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,949

control position if i'm a lot bigger

266
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
control position if i'm a lot bigger
 

267
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,629
control position if i'm a lot bigger
than him that might work out but if he's

268
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
than him that might work out but if he's
 

269
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,390
than him that might work out but if he's
bigger than me this is going to be a

270
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
bigger than me this is going to be a
 

271
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,870
bigger than me this is going to be a
momentary thing so i can get out of

272
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
momentary thing so i can get out of
 

273
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,870
momentary thing so i can get out of
there right so and actually my exit

274
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
there right so and actually my exit
 

275
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,390
there right so and actually my exit
should be made this way is what i should

276
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
should be made this way is what i should
 

277
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,629
should be made this way is what i should
be looking for um but that's my idea

278
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
be looking for um but that's my idea
 

279
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,469
be looking for um but that's my idea
right is so from here i'm just looking

280
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
right is so from here i'm just looking
 

281

udeo say position if this guy goes to

288
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
udeo say position if this guy goes to
 

289
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,430
udeo say position if this guy goes to
get up i naturally get sankyo here so it

290
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
get up i naturally get sankyo here so it
 

291
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,030
get up i naturally get sankyo here so it
goes right into sankhya so if you're

292
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
goes right into sankhya so if you're
 

293
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,030
goes right into sankhya so if you're
having an uke who's loving to resist

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
having an uke who's loving to resist
 

295
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,270
having an uke who's loving to resist
resist resist let him stand up and he'll

296
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
resist resist let him stand up and he'll
 

297
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590
resist resist let him stand up and he'll
pop right into that okay now another

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
pop right into that okay now another
 

299
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,749
pop right into that okay now another

spot so all i'm doing is sliding from
 

341
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,670
spot so all i'm doing is sliding from
here to here and we see this again

inside the sensei's form where the ikkyo

344
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
inside the sensei's form where the ikkyo
 

345
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,510
inside the sensei's form where the ikkyo
is not working out for us so when he

346
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
is not working out for us so when he
 

347
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,590
is not working out for us so when he
tries to get up we pop down here and he

348
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
tries to get up we pop down here and he
 

349
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,110
tries to get up we pop down here and he
goes right into that yonkyo spot and

350
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
goes right into that yonkyo spot and
 

351
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,710
goes right into that yonkyo spot and
we're sliding right into yonkyo when we

352
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
we're sliding right into yonkyo when we
 

353
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,469
we're sliding right into yonkyo when we
get to the conren for yonkyo we'll talk

354
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
get to the conren for yonkyo we'll talk
 

355
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,150
get to the conren for yonkyo we'll talk
about all the different yonkyo positions

356
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
about all the different yonkyo positions
 

357
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,070
about all the different yonkyo positions
from there but all these ideas are based
