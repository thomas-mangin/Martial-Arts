kind of ingrains the ideas of the

40
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
kind of ingrains the ideas of the

initially meaning that you'll kind of

44
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
initially meaning that you'll kind of
 

45
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,069
initially meaning that you'll kind of
see

46
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
see
 

47
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,750
see
why one technique will feed another

48
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
why one technique will feed another
 

49
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,510
why one technique will feed another
technique and and this goes in a really

50
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
technique and and this goes in a really
 

51
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,750
technique and and this goes in a really
nice progression of one through six um

52
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
nice progression of one through six um
 

53
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,029
nice progression of one through six um
but they could go in many different

54
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
but they could go in many different
 

55
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,389
but they could go in many different
progressions once you kind of understand

56
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
progressions once you kind of understand
 

57
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,229
progressions once you kind of understand
this basic idea so this starts from the

58
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
this basic idea so this starts from the
 

59
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,630
this basic idea so this starts from the
shomonuchi position the very first kill

60
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
shomonuchi position the very first kill
 

61
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,950
shomonuchi position the very first kill
was as ee and so that's controlling the

62
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
was as ee and so that's controlling the
 

63
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,550
was as ee and so that's controlling the
underside of the elbow right here so if

64
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
underside of the elbow right here so if
 

65
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,990
underside of the elbow right here so if
they can if i control the underside of

66
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
they can if i control the underside of
 

67
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,469
they can if i control the underside of
their elbow then i i can push them away

68
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
their elbow then i i can push them away
 

69
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,910
their elbow then i i can push them away
from me or whatever it is i can do right

70
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
from me or whatever it is i can do right
 

71
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,749
from me or whatever it is i can do right
so that turns out real good for me all

72
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
so that turns out real good for me all
 

73
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,350
so that turns out real good for me all
right now in that if i go into ikyo and

74
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
right now in that if i go into ikyo and
 

75
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,990
right now in that if i go into ikyo and
they grab me and i can't get them off

76
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
they grab me and i can't get them off
 

77
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,590
they grab me and i can't get them off
and they start working their elbow down

78
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
and they start working their elbow down
 

79
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,270
and they start working their elbow down
and they're stronger than me then i

80
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
and they're stronger than me then i
 

81
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,469
and they're stronger than me then i
don't have an eq and you see he gets

82
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
don't have an eq and you see he gets
 

83
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,069
don't have an eq and you see he gets
anikia for that right and so in fact if

84
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
anikia for that right and so in fact if
 

85
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,469
anikia for that right and so in fact if
you've taken a uh need on test that's

86
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
you've taken a uh need on test that's
 

87
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,230
you've taken a uh need on test that's
the that's the conrad or the kaishi for

88
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
the that's the conrad or the kaishi for
 

89
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,710
the that's the conrad or the kaishi for
it okay so i'm here like this as he

90
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
it okay so i'm here like this as he
 

91
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,149
it okay so i'm here like this as he
pushes the elbow down what i'm going to

92
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
pushes the elbow down what i'm going to
 

93
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,469
pushes the elbow down what i'm going to
do is immediately go to nikki so you see

94
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
do is immediately go to nikki so you see
 

95
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,630
do is immediately go to nikki so you see
i'm using his desire to get out of ekyo

96
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
i'm using his desire to get out of ekyo
 

97
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,870
i'm using his desire to get out of ekyo
to go into nikki now this is a little

98
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
to go into nikki now this is a little
 

99
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,469
to go into nikki now this is a little
bit of a contrived way to show it

100
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
bit of a contrived way to show it
 

101
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,230
bit of a contrived way to show it
because generally i believe this nico

102
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
because generally i believe this nico
 

103
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,469
because generally i believe this nico
should be used as hidoki like that but

104
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
should be used as hidoki like that but
 

105
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,310
should be used as hidoki like that but
we're keeping it so we can kind of flow

106
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
we're keeping it so we can kind of flow
 

107
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,710
we're keeping it so we can kind of flow
a little more here okay now if i start

108
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
a little more here okay now if i start
 

109
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,630
a little more here okay now if i start
to work nico and he raises his elbow of

110
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
to work nico and he raises his elbow of
 

111
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,830
to work nico and he raises his elbow of
course i have ikkyo again but i also now

112
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
course i have ikkyo again but i also now
 

113
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,149
course i have ikkyo again but i also now
have sankyo as you can see i can come

114
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
have sankyo as you can see i can come
 

115
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,910
have sankyo as you can see i can come
into sankyo and control him there and

116
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
into sankyo and control him there and
 

117
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,910
into sankyo and control him there and
that's because his elbow went back up if

118
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
that's because his elbow went back up if
 

119
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,910
that's because his elbow went back up if
he tries to drop his elbow down and

120
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
he tries to drop his elbow down and
 

121
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,109
he tries to drop his elbow down and
that's what would take the sankhya over

122
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
that's what would take the sankhya over
 

123
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,469
that's what would take the sankhya over
so if he dropped his arm this way he

124
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
so if he dropped his arm this way he
 

125
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,309
so if he dropped his arm this way he
could throw me back that way right so if

126
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
could throw me back that way right so if
 

127
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,990
could throw me back that way right so if
he can drive that arm down that's no

128
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
he can drive that arm down that's no
 

129
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,589
he can drive that arm down that's no
good for me so what i do is i slide my

130
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
good for me so what i do is i slide my
 

131
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,430
good for me so what i do is i slide my
hand here and i get yonkyo and now by

132
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
hand here and i get yonkyo and now by
 

133
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,710
hand here and i get yonkyo and now by
being in the yunkan position if he

134
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
being in the yunkan position if he
 

135
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,790
being in the yunkan position if he
pushes his elbow down he hates it right

136
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
pushes his elbow down he hates it right
 

137
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,229
pushes his elbow down he hates it right
it's no good so that's not not a good

138
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
it's no good so that's not not a good
 

139
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,150
it's no good so that's not not a good
position for him but now let's say this

140
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
position for him but now let's say this
 

141
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,430
position for him but now let's say this
is a real brute of a guy and he can

142
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
is a real brute of a guy and he can
 

143
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,430
is a real brute of a guy and he can
drive it down anyways i catch him in

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
drive it down anyways i catch him in
 

145
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,270
drive it down anyways i catch him in
here and i get gokyo and this is often

146
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
here and i get gokyo and this is often
 

147
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,550
here and i get gokyo and this is often

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
that's going to give me rokyo right here
 

159
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,509
that's going to give me rokyo right here
so the rokio sets up in the form of

160
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
so the rokio sets up in the form of
 

161
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,589
so the rokio sets up in the form of
myotosh so myotosh is also a rokyo

162
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
myotosh so myotosh is also a rokyo
 

163
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,190
myotosh so myotosh is also a rokyo
anytime i'm going against the elbow

that's roku
now what's important to understand about

168
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
now what's important to understand about
 

169
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,030
now what's important to understand about
this is

170
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
this is

with an arm the arm only has three

176
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
with an arm the arm only has three
 

177
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,750
with an arm the arm only has three
positions right the arm can be straight

178
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
positions right the arm can be straight
 

179
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,670
positions right the arm can be straight
the hand can be up from a straight arm

180
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
the hand can be up from a straight arm
 

181
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,270
the hand can be up from a straight arm
or the hand can be down from a straight

182
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
or the hand can be down from a straight
 

183
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,030
or the hand can be down from a straight
arm that's it and up and down's relative

184
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
arm that's it and up and down's relative
 

185
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,030
arm that's it and up and down's relative
to the person up is towards their head

186
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
to the person up is towards their head
 

187
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,550
to the person up is towards their head
hand towards their head and down his

188
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
hand towards their head and down his
 

189
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,309
hand towards their head and down his
hand towards their feet right so it's

190
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
hand towards their feet right so it's
 

191
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,309
hand towards their feet right so it's
either going to be straight up or down

192
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
either going to be straight up or down
 

193
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,630
either going to be straight up or down
aikido has lots of ways to solve that

understand ekyo's there but also
 

221
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,589
understand ekyo's there but also
sankyo's there now if we're in this up

222
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
sankyo's there now if we're in this up

elbow position and he wants to

224
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
elbow position and he wants to
 

225
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,430
elbow position and he wants to
transition down i could slide my hand

226
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
transition down i could slide my hand
 

227
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,509
transition down i could slide my hand
here so when he tries to go down it

228

here so when he tries to go down it
 

229
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,710
here so when he tries to go down it
doesn't like it anymore right and he

230
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
doesn't like it anymore right and he
 

231
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,309
doesn't like it anymore right and he
shoots his l before which again gives me

232
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
shoots his l before which again gives me

the eq or the sankyo if i wanted either
 

235
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,390
the eq or the sankyo if i wanted either
of those but if i tried that technique

of those but if i tried that technique
 

237
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,309
of those but if i tried that technique
and it failed and it came down anyways i

238
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
and it failed and it came down anyways i
 

239
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,990
and it failed and it came down anyways i
can still trap his arm in this little

this this is an it right and then if i'm

246
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
this this is an it right and then if i'm
 

247

shoots his arm straight to be strong i
 

251
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,949
shoots his arm straight to be strong i
could get rokyo now i said these could

252
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
could get rokyo now i said these could
 

253
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,470
could get rokyo now i said these could
go together in different ways so

254
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
go together in different ways so
 

255
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,390
go together in different ways so
understand if i was trying to do sankyo

256
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
understand if i was trying to do sankyo
 

257
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,670
understand if i was trying to do sankyo
and he straightened his arm to get out

258
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
and he straightened his arm to get out
 

259
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,030
and he straightened his arm to get out
of the sunkyo and it did it weakened by

260
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
of the sunkyo and it did it weakened by
 

261
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,589
of the sunkyo and it did it weakened by
sunkyo i still have rokyo because a

262
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
sunkyo i still have rokyo because a
 

263
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,069
sunkyo i still have rokyo because a
straight arm is a rokyo technique right

264
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
straight arm is a rokyo technique right
 

265
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,189
straight arm is a rokyo technique right
let's say i was going into a i'm just

266
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
let's say i was going into a i'm just
 

267
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,629
let's say i was going into a i'm just
making one up that's kind of crazy here

268
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
making one up that's kind of crazy here
 

269
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,870
making one up that's kind of crazy here
let's say i'm going into enikyo and he

270
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
let's say i'm going into enikyo and he
 

271
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,510
let's say i'm going into enikyo and he
wants to raise his elbow up right from

272
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
wants to raise his elbow up right from
 

273
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,150
wants to raise his elbow up right from
this i can go to ikyo or i could go to

274
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
this i can go to ikyo or i could go to
 

275
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,469
this i can go to ikyo or i could go to
sankyo or i can go to anything that's

276
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
sankyo or i can go to anything that's
 

277
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,390
sankyo or i can go to anything that's
elbow up so that's the way you should be

278
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
elbow up so that's the way you should be
 

279
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,590
elbow up so that's the way you should be
thinking about instead of thinking that

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
thinking about instead of thinking that
 

281
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
thinking about instead of thinking that

shonuchi has to happen and then this has
 

287
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,790
shonuchi has to happen and then this has
to happen and that has to happen it's

288
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
to happen and that has to happen it's
 

289
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,070
to happen and that has to happen it's
limiting the way you can do your

290
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
limiting the way you can do your
 

291
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,830
limiting the way you can do your
techniques but when you understand that

292
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
techniques but when you understand that
 

293
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,670
techniques but when you understand that
the kill was that each feed each other

294
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
the kill was that each feed each other
 

295
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,830
the kill was that each feed each other
one kilwaza leads into another kyowasa

296
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
one kilwaza leads into another kyowasa
 

297
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,749
one kilwaza leads into another kyowasa
and generally when a kyowasa can't

298
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
and generally when a kyowasa can't
 

299
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,070
and generally when a kyowasa can't
happen we use a nagewaza to upset their

300
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
happen we use a nagewaza to upset their
 

301
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,550
happen we use a nagewaza to upset their
balance so we reset the situation so

302
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
balance so we reset the situation so
 

303
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,950
balance so we reset the situation so
that's kind of the systematic way these

304
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
that's kind of the systematic way these
 

305
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,710
that's kind of the systematic way these
techniques are working so this little

306
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
techniques are working so this little
 

307
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,710
techniques are working so this little
flow drill is a nice way to kind of work

308
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
