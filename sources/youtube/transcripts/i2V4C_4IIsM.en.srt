1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,550

You can't come off of what you're doing.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
You can't come off of what you're doing.
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,990
You can't come off of what you're doing.
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,110
So, let's say uh we generate the energy.
Okay, there there's that. I feel his

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
Okay, there there's that. I feel his
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,669
Okay, there there's that. I feel his
unification and then I try I come out of

8
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
unification and then I try I come out of
 

9
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,270
unification and then I try I come out of
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm

10
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm
 

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,509
what I'm doing. Do you see what I'm
doing? You get what I'm saying here?

12
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
doing? You get what I'm saying here?
 

13
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,029
doing? You get what I'm saying here?
Okay. So, we we're here.

14
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
Okay. So, we we're here.
 

15
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,910
Okay. So, we we're here.
We generate.

16
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
We generate.
 

17
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,750
We generate.
And what I would recommend is that you

18
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
And what I would recommend is that you
 

19
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,150
And what I would recommend is that you
barely move this thing.

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160

 

21
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,750

I'm barely moving it to me train train

22
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm barely moving it to me train train
 

23
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,670
I'm barely moving it to me train train
to to me actually trained I I feel his

24
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
to to me actually trained I I feel his
 

25
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,830
to to me actually trained I I feel his
center already. Okay. I'm just

26
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
center already. Okay. I'm just
 

27
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,430
center already. Okay. I'm just
confirming it with the tiny bit of

28
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
confirming it with the tiny bit of
 

29
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,950
confirming it with the tiny bit of
movement. So tiny right there. Okay. You

30
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
movement. So tiny right there. Okay. You
 

31
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,590
movement. So tiny right there. Okay. You
understand? So don't you're not trying

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
understand? So don't you're not trying
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,510
understand? So don't you're not trying
to throw him like that. You saw how he

34
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
to throw him like that. You saw how he
 

35
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,029
to throw him like that. You saw how he
linked. Okay.

36
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039

 

37
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,549

Okay,

38
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
Okay,
 

39
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,869
Okay,
I'm just trying to that force is on us.

40
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
I'm just trying to that force is on us.
 

41
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,670
I'm just trying to that force is on us.
We have communed and I'm just moving

42
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
We have communed and I'm just moving
 

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,030
We have communed and I'm just moving
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?

44
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?
 

45
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,550
that thing ever so tiny. See his head?
Okay.

46
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560

 

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,590

Okay. Now let for for you

48
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay. Now let for for you
 

49
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,630
Okay. Now let for for you
what will happen is

50
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
what will happen is
 

51
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,870
what will happen is
that when they feel that they they will

52
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
that when they feel that they they will
 

53
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,950
that when they feel that they they will
react against that's what people do.

54
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
react against that's what people do.
 

55
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,270
react against that's what people do.
Okay. And if I keep what I'm doing the

56
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
Okay. And if I keep what I'm doing the
 

57
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,670
Okay. And if I keep what I'm doing the
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the

58
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the
 

59
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,550
adhesion gets tighter. So watch the
watch that the the the

60
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
watch that the the the
 

61
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,830
watch that the the the
yong value got like higher as we go.

62
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
yong value got like higher as we go.
 

63
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,910
yong value got like higher as we go.
Okay. So

64
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay. So
 

65
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,429
Okay. So
you might experience that. So meaning

66
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
you might experience that. So meaning
 

67
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,389
you might experience that. So meaning
that if I go and there's his yong value

68
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
that if I go and there's his yong value
 

69
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,149
that if I go and there's his yong value
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose

70
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose
 

71
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,069
and it triggers me, I'm going to lose
it. I'm going to link. You understand?

72
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
it. I'm going to link. You understand?
 

73
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,190
it. I'm going to link. You understand?
So his his increase as I start to

74
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
So his his increase as I start to
 

75
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,590
So his his increase as I start to
manipulate his center

76
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600

 

77
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,670

should make feel that value getting

78
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
should make feel that value getting
 

79
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,190
should make feel that value getting
higher here and that gives you the

80
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
higher here and that gives you the
 

81
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,869
higher here and that gives you the
center much easier as long as you don't

82
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
center much easier as long as you don't
 

83
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,239
center much easier as long as you don't
go into the reactionary cycle. Okay.
