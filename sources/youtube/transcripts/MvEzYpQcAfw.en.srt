1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,470

all

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,480
all
 

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,749
all
right uh let's just work with

4
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:04,759
right uh let's just work with
 

5
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,270
right uh let's just work with
katata so he's going to grab cool all

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
katata so he's going to grab cool all
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,589
katata so he's going to grab cool all
right we do it again watch his grip

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,599
right we do it again watch his grip
 

9
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,189
right we do it again watch his grip
cool and one more

10
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
cool and one more
 

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,070
cool and one more
time cool all right uh let's do this

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,080
time cool all right uh let's do this
 

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,189
time cool all right uh let's do this
side now so you can see on the back side

14
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:24,199
side now so you can see on the back side
 

15
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,950
side now so you can see on the back side
cool a little

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:25,960
cool a little
 

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,790
cool a little
slower slow cool and again

18
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
slower slow cool and again
 

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,830
slower slow cool and again
all

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,840
all
 

21
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,150
all
right A lot of times what we do

22
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
right A lot of times what we do
 

23
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,830
right A lot of times what we do
is uh we might recognize his spinal

24
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
is uh we might recognize his spinal
 

25
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,590
is uh we might recognize his spinal
displacement so you're going to see I

26
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
displacement so you're going to see I
 

27
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,229
displacement so you're going to see I
won't ground it this time as he goes you

28
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
won't ground it this time as he goes you
 

29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,750
won't ground it this time as he goes you
could see it in the tilt of his torso

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
could see it in the tilt of his torso
 

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,910
could see it in the tilt of his torso
okay do it one more time I won't ground

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
okay do it one more time I won't ground
 

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,830
okay do it one more time I won't ground
it so you see the effect on me

34
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
it so you see the effect on me
 

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,310
it so you see the effect on me
okay um and so we P we think he's going

36
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
okay um and so we P we think he's going
 

37
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,270
okay um and so we P we think he's going
this way and so as long as

38
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:04,280
this way and so as long as
 

39
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,230
this way and so as long as
I um have my motion going in a in a

40
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
I um have my motion going in a in a
 

41
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,310
I um have my motion going in a in a
harmonious Direction with that we think

42
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
harmonious Direction with that we think
 

43
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,149
harmonious Direction with that we think
we have not

44
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:15,159
we have not
 

45
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,069
we have not
contested okay but if we just slow

46
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:19,079
contested okay but if we just slow
 

47
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,630
contested okay but if we just slow
motion uh pretend my arm is

48
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
motion uh pretend my arm is
 

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,350
motion uh pretend my arm is
there okay and if you pay attention the

50
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
there okay and if you pay attention the
 

51
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,950
there okay and if you pay attention the
fingers are going the other way so yes

52
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,960
fingers are going the other way so yes
 

53
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,910
fingers are going the other way so yes
his spine he's doing spinal displacement

54
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
his spine he's doing spinal displacement
 

55
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,270
his spine he's doing spinal displacement
but the fingers are going back the other

56
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,280
but the fingers are going back the other
 

57
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,510
but the fingers are going back the other
way do you see that so if I actually go

58
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:40,520
way do you see that so if I actually go
 

59
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,630
way do you see that so if I actually go
this way I'm actually contesting the

60
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
this way I'm actually contesting the
 

61
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,670
this way I'm actually contesting the
fingers

62
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
fingers
 

63
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,670
fingers
okay your choreograph ID they were going

64
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
okay your choreograph ID they were going
 

65
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,990
okay your choreograph ID they were going
to fly that way anyway so you don't

66
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
to fly that way anyway so you don't
 

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,389
to fly that way anyway so you don't
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes

68
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes
 

69
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,550
really feel it but your scaredy cat ukes
or the ukes who are just grounding

70
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,560
or the ukes who are just grounding
 

71
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,069
or the ukes who are just grounding
you'll feel the fingers okay and and

72
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
you'll feel the fingers okay and and
 

73
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,069
you'll feel the fingers okay and and
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers

74
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers
 

75
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,630
you'll feel the Yong of the fingers
because you're yanging on the fingers

76
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
because you're yanging on the fingers
 

77
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,749
because you're yanging on the fingers
okay um that is another reason why the

78
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,759
okay um that is another reason why the
 

79
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,190
okay um that is another reason why the
hand workk that we use isn't for example

80
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
hand workk that we use isn't for example
 

81
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,110
hand workk that we use isn't for example
like this

82
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
like this
 

83
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,430
like this
one here remember remember that EO

84
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,440
one here remember remember that EO
 

85
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,309

see that the tabaki that we use it's
 

109
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,990
see that the tabaki that we use it's
going to reconcile the fingerpull as as

going to reconcile the fingerpull as as
 

111
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,070
going to reconcile the fingerpull as as
it reconciles the spinal displacement so

112
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,080
it reconciles the spinal displacement so
 

113
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,350
it reconciles the spinal displacement so
for example in

114
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360

I don't pull on the fingers I'm inside
his grip got it and so the the Eco that

132
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
his grip got it and so the the Eco that
 

133
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,390
his grip got it and so the the Eco that
we're doing is I go this way do you see

134
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
we're doing is I go this way do you see
 

135
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,750
we're doing is I go this way do you see
and then around and I'm working inside

136
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
and then around and I'm working inside
 

137
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,789
and then around and I'm working inside
the fingers on the inward

138
