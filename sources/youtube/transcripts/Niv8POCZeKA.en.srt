227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,030

You need the spiral rotation, not just

228
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
You need the spiral rotation, not just
 

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,750
You need the spiral rotation, not just
rotating.

230
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760

 

231
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,670

And it doesn't always have to be a
 

233
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,150
And it doesn't always have to be a
throw.

234
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
throw.
 

235
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,590
throw.
>> That was just the one you were going

236
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
>> That was just the one you were going
 

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:28,389
>> That was just the one you were going
for. That's the one I corrected.

238
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399

 

239
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,230

You got to pin that foot

240
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
You got to pin that foot
 

241
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:52,630
You got to pin that foot
otherwise they'll keep stepping.

242
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:52,640

 

243
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,470

Okay.

So, uh
 

247
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,470
So, uh
she she uh uh pushes.

248
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
she she uh uh pushes.
 

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,829
she she uh uh pushes.
You see

250
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
You see
 

251
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,629
You see
>> she pulls.

252
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
>> she pulls.
 

253
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,030
>> she pulls.
If she pushes, I'm not going here. If

254
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
If she pushes, I'm not going here. If
 

255
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,990
If she pushes, I'm not going here. If
she pulls, I'm not going here. Do you

256
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
she pulls, I'm not going here. Do you
 

257
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,509
she pulls, I'm not going here. Do you
see that? I just trading which foot

258
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
see that? I just trading which foot
 

259
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,389
see that? I just trading which foot
the ground the energy is going to. So

260
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
the ground the energy is going to. So
 

261
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,470
the ground the energy is going to. So
when she pulls, it goes to the front

262
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
when she pulls, it goes to the front
 

263
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,350
when she pulls, it goes to the front
foot. When she pushes, goes to the back

264
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
foot. When she pushes, goes to the back
 

265
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,670
foot. When she pushes, goes to the back
foot. Do you see that? So not not my

266
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
foot. Do you see that? So not not my
 

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,470
foot. Do you see that? So not not my
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.

268
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.
 

269
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,710
line of gravity for pull. She pulls.
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's

270
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's
 

271
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,389
It's in the back. When she pushes, it's
in the front. I'm not doing that. Just

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
in the front. I'm not doing that. Just
 

273
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,430
in the front. I'm not doing that. Just

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:47,110
shifting. Okay. Just shifting. Just
shifting where I'm at. And I go

276
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120

Okay. Try it again.

282
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639

 

283
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,230

So it's front foot, front foot

288
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
So it's front foot, front foot
 

289
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,030
So it's front foot, front foot
start. If it's already hard there, then

290
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
start. If it's already hard there, then
 

291
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,150
start. If it's already hard there, then
you start turning it there.

292
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160

 

293
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,590

>> Put the back foot down and move the
 

337
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,590
>> Put the back foot down and move the
front foot now. Do you see that?

338
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
front foot now. Do you see that?
 

339
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,829
front foot now. Do you see that?
>> Okay. So that's just cuz you stayed on

340
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
>> Okay. So that's just cuz you stayed on
 

341
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,110
>> Okay. So that's just cuz you stayed on
that pin.

342
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
that pin.
 

343
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,350
that pin.
>> So as you go to move, I keep doing it.

344
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
>> So as you go to move, I keep doing it.
 

345
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,829
>> So as you go to move, I keep doing it.
>> Do you understand? And then it's easier.

346
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
>> Do you understand? And then it's easier.
 

347
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,110
>> Do you understand? And then it's easier.
So, uh, start turning it. There's the

348
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
So, uh, start turning it. There's the
 

349
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,990
So, uh, start turning it. There's the
pin on that foot. Do you get it?

350
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
pin on that foot. Do you get it?
 

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,069
pin on that foot. Do you get it?
>> You're pulling right home. There's the

352
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
>> You're pulling right home. There's the
 

353
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,269
>> You're pulling right home. There's the
turn. And right when you go there, I

354
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
turn. And right when you go there, I
 

355
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,750
turn. And right when you go there, I
take advantage of that. Okay. As opposed

356
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
take advantage of that. Okay. As opposed
 

357
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,189
take advantage of that. Okay. As opposed
to let you get that. So, when you go,

358
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
to let you get that. So, when you go,
 

359
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,550
to let you get that. So, when you go,
I could do it here or I could do it

360
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
I could do it here or I could do it
 

361
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,750
I could do it here or I could do it
here.

362
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
here.
 

363
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,910
here.
>> When you go one foot, okay? But you have

364
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
>> When you go one foot, okay? But you have
 

365
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:35,430
>> When you go one foot, okay? But you have
to stay in it. Okay.

366
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440

 

367
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,829

See like that. In between that step is

368
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
See like that. In between that step is
 

369
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,790
See like that. In between that step is
where you can do it.

370
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800

 

371
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,030

>> Otherwise, they'll just keep doing that

372
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
>> Otherwise, they'll just keep doing that
 

373
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:56,470
>> Otherwise, they'll just keep doing that
all day.

374
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480

 

375
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:23,350

Don't fight her grip. Use her grip.

376
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360

 

377
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,189

You have to always have one ground

378
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
You have to always have one ground
 

379
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:38,710
You have to always have one ground
vectoring foot.

380
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720

 

381
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:54,550

Switch roles.

382
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560

 

383
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,230

Turn it. Turn it. Yes.

384
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
Turn it. Turn it. Yes.
 

385
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,949
Turn it. Turn it. Yes.
Good. And you're going to not take these

386
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
Good. And you're going to not take these
 

387
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,870
Good. And you're going to not take these
dice. So, it might not be such a pretty

388
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
dice. So, it might not be such a pretty
 

389
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,910
dice. So, it might not be such a pretty
roll.

390
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
roll.
 

391
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,870
roll.
>> Okay.

392
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880

 

393
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,949

>> Turn it.

394
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959

 

395
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,590

Well, don't pick it up. Use the

396
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, don't pick it up. Use the
 

397
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:31,350
Well, don't pick it up. Use the
adhesion.

398
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360

 

399
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:50,789

Turn it.

400
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799

 

401
00:17:50,799 --> 00:18:07,590

Turn. Turn.

402
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600

 

403
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,669

So it's in your head. You're you're

404
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
So it's in your head. You're you're
 

405
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,510
So it's in your head. You're you're
going here. Okay. So right when here

406
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
going here. Okay. So right when here
 

407
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,190
going here. Okay. So right when here
look I turn. Okay. So you you you to

408
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
look I turn. Okay. So you you you to
 

409
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,230
look I turn. Okay. So you you you to
turn one part has to either not move and

410
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
turn one part has to either not move and
 

411
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,630
turn one part has to either not move and
the other part has to move or one part

412
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
the other part has to move or one part
 

413
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,789
the other part has to move or one part
can move slower than the other part

414
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
can move slower than the other part
 

415
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,710
can move slower than the other part
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you

416
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you
 

417
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,190
moving faster than you'll turn. Do you
see that? I move both parts together.

418
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
see that? I move both parts together.
 

419
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,350
see that? I move both parts together.
It's not going to happen. Okay. If I go

420
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
It's not going to happen. Okay. If I go
 

421
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,510
It's not going to happen. Okay. If I go
here for because you can keep resisting

422
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
here for because you can keep resisting
 

423
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,270
here for because you can keep resisting
this technique, we just are changing the

424
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
this technique, we just are changing the
 

425
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,950
this technique, we just are changing the
relationship. That's all we're doing.

426
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
relationship. That's all we're doing.
 

427
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,470
relationship. That's all we're doing.
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the

428
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the
 

429
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,549
Okay. So to get the spiral rotate at the
beginning, one side either stops, the

430
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
beginning, one side either stops, the
 

431
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,710
beginning, one side either stops, the
other side turns there. There's the

432
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
other side turns there. There's the
 

433
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,549
other side turns there. There's the
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work

434
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work
 

435
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,230
turn. Do you see? Okay. And now you work
with whatever they're doing on you.

436
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
with whatever they're doing on you.
 

437
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,549
with whatever they're doing on you.
Okay. So we're back where we started.

438
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
Okay. So we're back where we started.
 

439
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,430
Okay. So we're back where we started.
Right?

440
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
Right?
 

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,950
Right?
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one

442
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one
 

443
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,909
>> Right. Did you see that? So I go one
boom. And as you do that, I take you

444
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
boom. And as you do that, I take you
 

445
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,390
boom. And as you do that, I take you
further in. Do you see? Okay.

446
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
further in. Do you see? Okay.
 

447
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,350
further in. Do you see? Okay.
>> And then now, this is what always

448
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
>> And then now, this is what always
 

449
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,350
>> And then now, this is what always
happens is as you try to not fall, you

450
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
happens is as you try to not fall, you
 

451
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,750
happens is as you try to not fall, you
now stopped pulling and you're now

452
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
now stopped pulling and you're now
 

453
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,990
now stopped pulling and you're now
pushing on me. Do do you see that? And

454
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
pushing on me. Do do you see that? And
 

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,270
pushing on me. Do do you see that? And
so that's what I use.

456
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
so that's what I use.
 

457
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,270
so that's what I use.
>> Okay? But you have to be sensitive to

458
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
>> Okay? But you have to be sensitive to
 

459
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,990
>> Okay? But you have to be sensitive to
it.

460
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
it.
 

461
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,870
it.
>> So one side moves the the other one

462
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
>> So one side moves the the other one
 

463
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,029
>> So one side moves the the other one
moves at a different rate. Do you see?

464
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
moves at a different rate. Do you see?
 

465
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,630
moves at a different rate. Do you see?
Okay. Okay. And we going. There's that

466
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay. Okay. And we going. There's that
 

467
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,150
Okay. Okay. And we going. There's that
step.

468
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
step.
 

469
00:19:36,160 --> 00:20:20,710
step.
And you go.

470
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720

 

471
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,470

Boom. There it is.

472
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
Boom. There it is.
 

473
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,950
Boom. There it is.
Good. Let you have it if you come up.

474
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
Good. Let you have it if you come up.
 

475
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,830
Good. Let you have it if you come up.
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see

476
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see
 

477
00:20:29,840 --> 00:21:01,110
Good. Cool. Go in this way. So, you see
that one?

478
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120

 

479
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,830

Go back here or over here. No, you were

480
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
Go back here or over here. No, you were
 

481
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,390
Go back here or over here. No, you were
there and you felt that one coming,

482
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
there and you felt that one coming,
 

483
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,950
there and you felt that one coming,
right?

484
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
right?
 

485
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,590
right?
>> So, you pushed and I go here and we're

486
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
>> So, you pushed and I go here and we're
 

487
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,990
>> So, you pushed and I go here and we're
over here now. See?

488
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
over here now. See?
 

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,870
over here now. See?
And then you felt you push on me.

490
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
And then you felt you push on me.
 

491
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:38,789
And then you felt you push on me.
Boom.

492
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799

 

493
00:21:38,799 --> 00:22:30,789

There it is.

494
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799

 

495
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,950

Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll

496
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll
 

497
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,590
Then if they hyper yin yield, you'll
take the spine line. Do you understand?

498
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
take the spine line. Do you understand?
 

499
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,430
take the spine line. Do you understand?
Okay. So, we're coming in here,

500
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
Okay. So, we're coming in here,

right? And then you go in this way and
 

503
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,750
right? And then you go in this way and
disarm yield.

504
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
disarm yield.
 

505
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,750
disarm yield.
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine

506
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine
 

507
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,350
>> Do you see? So, then you take the spine
line.

508
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
line.
 

509
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,390
line.
Okay.

510
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400

 

511
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,430

513
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,669
You have to feel all that. So, boom.
Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the

Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the
 

515
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,310
Can step if you want. Change it. Pin the
foot to it's too low for you to do

516
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
foot to it's too low for you to do
 

517

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
anything with the stepping. You can do
 

519
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:43,990

529
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,950

there's the yin yield. There's the head.

530
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
there's the yin yield. There's the head.
 

531
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:28,390
there's the yin yield. There's the head.
Okay.

532

So, right that it's just like an attack.

538
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
So, right that it's just like an attack.
 

539
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,750
So, right that it's just like an attack.
If I push, you turn it.

540
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
If I push, you turn it.
 

541
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,470
If I push, you turn it.
>> So, I pull. Yes.

542
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
So go back when I pushed cuz you had my
 

547
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:01,830
So go back when I pushed cuz you had my
balance. That's when you yielded. Good.

548
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840

 

549
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,070

Lower it. So stick. Stick. And if you go
 

555
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,029
Lower it. So stick. Stick. And if you go
here, you'll lower it. Good. And then

556
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
here, you'll lower it. Good. And then
 

557
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,710
here, you'll lower it. Good. And then
I'm pushing. And you push.

558

I'm pushing. And you push.
 

559
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,029
I'm pushing. And you push.
You have to resist the urge to push back

560
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
You have to resist the urge to push back
 

561
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,149

on me.

562
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159

 

563
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,390

Turn it. You can always step if you

564
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
Turn it. You can always step if you
 

565
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,710

Well, that set us back up. Do you see?

570
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
Well, that set us back up. Do you see?
 

571
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:46,070
Well, that set us back up. Do you see?
You always have to spiral rotate.

572
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080

 

573
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,870

>> Can Can you go somewhere where you're
 

579
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:09,540
>> Can Can you go somewhere where you're
not pulling back on it?

580
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:09,550

 

581
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,830

591
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,590
watch watch what I do. Look how you're
pulling there. Got it?

592
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
pulling there. Got it?
 

593
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,149
pulling there. Got it?
>> Okay. So go back

>> You see?
So just enough of a change.

600
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
So just enough of a change.
 

601
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,830
So just enough of a change.
That's not what you wanted. You wanted

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
>> So as you go to pull this goes there.
 

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,789
>> So as you go to pull this goes there.
Then we're changing.

610
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799

 

611
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,990

So I go to pull

612
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
So I go to pull
 

613
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,110
So I go to pull
outward spiral. There it is. And here it

614
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
outward spiral. There it is. And here it
 

615

outward spiral. There it is. And here it
is right here. Do you see

616
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
is right here. Do you see
 

617
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,870
is right here. Do you see
>> height?

618
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
>> height?
 

619
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,669

So don't try to overpower it.
 

627
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,350
So don't try to overpower it.
>> Turn around it. Do you understand

628
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
>> Turn around it. Do you understand
 

629
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,990
>> Turn around it. Do you understand
>> height?

630
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000

 

631
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,269

You know my balance is back.

632
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279

 

633
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:27,269

There's the push.

634
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279

 

635
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:36,310

Then you yield spine

636
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320

 

637
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,950

feel that difference.

644
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
feel that difference.
 

645
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,269

So, go a little slower.
 

651
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,350
So, go a little slower.
Here's that pull.

652
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
Here's that pull.
 

653
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,710
Here's that pull.
Good. Don't push down. See, you smell

Good. Don't push down. See, you smell
leverage. You understand?

656
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880
leverage. You understand?
 

657
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,110
leverage. You understand?
>> Cuz you feel your skeletal alignment.

658
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
>> Cuz you feel your skeletal alignment.
 

659

Find my foot as light as possible.
 

841
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,150
Find my foot as light as possible.
Little too light. Too light.

842
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,160

 

843
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,030

Too light. F. Connect my foot. So,

844
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
Too light. F. Connect my foot. So,
 

845
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,470
Too light. F. Connect my foot. So,
here's what I mean. Okay. So, uh, as

you see? Okay. But not here.
>> But not here either. Okay. It's in the

854
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
>> But not here either. Okay. It's in the
 

855
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,270
>> But not here either. Okay. It's in the
center. So I can have the center. So we

856
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
center. So I can have the center. So we
 

857
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,069
center. So I can have the center. So we
have to feel my center.

858
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
have to feel my center.
 

859
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,790
have to feel my center.
Center. Find my There it is. Okay. And

860
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
Center. Find my There it is. Okay. And
 

861
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,349
Center. Find my There it is. Okay. And
do it again.

862
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359
do it again.
 

863
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,870
do it again.
Good.

864

865
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,950

You're kind of going that way. Go into

866
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
You're kind of going that way. Go into
 

867
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,310
You're kind of going that way. Go into
the center. Yes. And it's not about it's

868
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
the center. Yes. And it's not about it's
 

869
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,470
the center. Yes. And it's not about it's
it's about energy, not anatomy.

870
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
it's about energy, not anatomy.
 

871
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,870
it's about energy, not anatomy.
Okay. Stay there. Can you move me to

872
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
Okay. Stay there. Can you move me to
 

873
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,910
Okay. Stay there. Can you move me to
your right? Then get enough connection

874
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
your right? Then get enough connection
 

875
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,550
your right? Then get enough connection
there. It's not about down. It's in.

876
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
there. It's not about down. It's in.
 

877

879
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,710

Find my center

880
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
Find my center
 

881
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,430
Find my center
and go ahead and move it.

882
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
and go ahead and move it.
 

883
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,630

Stay. Stay. Not anatomy. You don't You
don't need to get over here to move it.

886
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,800
don't need to get over here to move it.
 

887
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,870
don't need to get over here to move it.
It's It's enough here. Move it. Yes.

00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240

 

893
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,550

You want to do anatomy. You want to go

894
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
You want to do anatomy. You want to go
 

895
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:08,470
You want to do anatomy. You want to go
like this.

896
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480

 

897
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,990

This

898
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000

 

899
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,870

You can always use your other hand.

900
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
You can always use your other hand.
 

901
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,750
You can always use your other hand.
Okay. If if you know if it's like it's

902
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
Okay. If if you know if it's like it's
 

903
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,150
Okay. If if you know if it's like it's
too slippery cuz we're sweating or

904
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
too slippery cuz we're sweating or
 

905
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,390
too slippery cuz we're sweating or
whatever. Okay. Or you double your

906
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
whatever. Okay. Or you double your
 

907
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,270
whatever. Okay. Or you double your
friction. But don't don't now go here

908
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
friction. But don't don't now go here
 

909
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,710
friction. But don't don't now go here
and then try to do that. Okay.

910
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720

 

911
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,230

Connection. See how you're on the

912
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
Connection. See how you're on the
 

913
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,109
Connection. See how you're on the
outside

914
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
outside
 

915
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,950
outside
on top. Good.

916
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
on top. Good.
 

917
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,829
on top. Good.
Wait for the queue.

918
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839

 

919
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,390

More here. Less around me.

920
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,400

 

921
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,550

>> Sure. Use it.

922
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,560

 

923
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,030

Don't fight it.

924
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,040
Don't fight it.
 

925
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,870
Don't fight it.
Yep.

926
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880

 

927
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,829

Don't fight it.

928
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839

 

929
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,030

Okay, try it.

930
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040

 

931
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:53,589

You're just pulling back.

932
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599

 

933
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,550

turn it instead of pulling against it.

934
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
turn it instead of pulling against it.
 

935
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,550
turn it instead of pulling against it.
Turn. And when we say turn, we always

936
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,560
Turn. And when we say turn, we always
 

937
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,109
Turn. And when we say turn, we always
mean their center.

938
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
mean their center.
 

939
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,270
mean their center.
Their center spiral rotates through

940
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
Their center spiral rotates through
 

941
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:18,710
Their center spiral rotates through
space

942
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720

 

943
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,870

and they can't move at the same time

944
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
and they can't move at the same time
 

945
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,510
and they can't move at the same time
because then we're just rotating, not

946
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
because then we're just rotating, not
 

947
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,470
because then we're just rotating, not
spiral rotating.

948
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
spiral rotating.
 

949
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,790
spiral rotating.
You have a yin hand and a yang hand at

950
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
You have a yin hand and a yang hand at
 

951
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,990
You have a yin hand and a yang hand at
all times.

952
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000

 

953
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,109

And the more they're yin to the yang or

954
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
And the more they're yin to the yang or
 

955
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,510
And the more they're yin to the yang or
vice versa, the more you'll spiral

956
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
vice versa, the more you'll spiral
 

957
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,310
vice versa, the more you'll spiral
rotate.

958
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,320
rotate.
 

959
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,790
rotate.
Do you understand that, Virgin?

960
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
Do you understand that, Virgin?
 

961
00:39:44,800 --> 00:40:09,510
Do you understand that, Virgin?
Okay.

962
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,520

 

963
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,550

So that means if one hand's going up and

964
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
So that means if one hand's going up and
 

965
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,710
So that means if one hand's going up and
out

966
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:14,720
out
 

967
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,910
out
and forward then the other hand is going

968
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
and forward then the other hand is going
 

969
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,870
and forward then the other hand is going
down and in and rearward. That's what I

970
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
down and in and rearward. That's what I
 

971
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:48,550
down and in and rearward. That's what I
mean. Okay.

972
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560

 

973
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,950

So if we had a glass table, both your

974
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
So if we had a glass table, both your
 

975
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,790
So if we had a glass table, both your
hands would be on it, your arms. So we

976
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
hands would be on it, your arms. So we
 

977
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,950
hands would be on it, your arms. So we
don't have a up and a down. So we don't

978
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
don't have a up and a down. So we don't
 

979
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:09,349
don't have a up and a down. So we don't
really have a yin and a yong.

980
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:09,359

 

981
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:24,630

You're back on the glass table.

982
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640

 

983
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,109

So here's uh it's classic coke hole

984
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
So here's uh it's classic coke hole
 

985
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,270
So here's uh it's classic coke hole
in this point. Okay. So, uh, you have a

986
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
in this point. Okay. So, uh, you have a
 

987
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,950
in this point. Okay. So, uh, you have a
lot of this

988
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:34,960
lot of this
 

989
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,230
lot of this
>> and then this hand is doing this. Do you

990
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,240
>> and then this hand is doing this. Do you
 

991
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,030
>> and then this hand is doing this. Do you
get it?

992
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,040
get it?
 

993
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,030
get it?
>> And so, if we had a glass table, they're

994
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,040
>> And so, if we had a glass table, they're
 

995
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,270
>> And so, if we had a glass table, they're
not This might be like a few inches off.

996
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
not This might be like a few inches off.
 

997
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,630
not This might be like a few inches off.
Do you see that? So, it looks like you

998
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
Do you see that? So, it looks like you
 

999
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,670
Do you see that? So, it looks like you
want this hand to go up

1000
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
want this hand to go up
 

1001
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,670
want this hand to go up
>> and in.

1002
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
>> and in.
 

1003
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,790
>> and in.
>> Okay.

1004
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,800
>> Okay.
 

1005
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,230
>> Okay.
>> And towards

1006
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
>> And towards
 

1007
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,589
>> And towards
>> Do you see?

1008
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
>> Do you see?
 

1009
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,150
>> Do you see?
>> Okay. Well, then this hand will go out

1010
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
>> Okay. Well, then this hand will go out
 

1011
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,589
>> Okay. Well, then this hand will go out
>> down, do you see? And towards me,

1012
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
>> down, do you see? And towards me,
 

1013
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,510
>> down, do you see? And towards me,
>> and then you get the bigger effect on

1014
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
>> and then you get the bigger effect on
 

1015
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:27,990
>> and then you get the bigger effect on
you.

1016
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000

 

1017
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,230

bigger effect on you because more of the

1018
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
bigger effect on you because more of the
 

1019
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,390
bigger effect on you because more of the
universe is working upon you and not

1020
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
universe is working upon you and not
 

1021
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,710
universe is working upon you and not
just aspect of it. Okay. All right. So

1022
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
just aspect of it. Okay. All right. So
 

1023
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,470
just aspect of it. Okay. All right. So
that's what I mean. Okay.

1024
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
that's what I mean. Okay.
 

1025
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,230
that's what I mean. Okay.
>> And we're usually not able to do it

1026
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
>> And we're usually not able to do it
 

1027
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:59,430
>> And we're usually not able to do it
because we get stuck on one point.

1028
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,440

 

1029
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,910

So that you stay where you are please.

1030
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:01,920
So that you stay where you are please.
 

1031
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,870
So that you stay where you are please.
Your right hand is all you're going to

1032
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
Your right hand is all you're going to
 

1033
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,230
Your right hand is all you're going to
get out of that and it is enough if you

1034
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
get out of that and it is enough if you
 

1035
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,109
get out of that and it is enough if you
take it to its final point.

1036
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119
take it to its final point.
 

1037
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,750
take it to its final point.
>> There it is. Now with the other hand go

1038
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
>> There it is. Now with the other hand go
 

1039
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,950
>> There it is. Now with the other hand go
more in and up and push. And that will

1040
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:16,960
more in and up and push. And that will
 

1041
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:26,069
more in and up and push. And that will
be a pivot point. Do you see?

1042
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079

 

1043
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:39,510

Fulfill more.

1044
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:39,520

 

1045
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,230

Ground the front foot.

1046
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240

 

1047
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,510

Change levels. Change levels.

1048
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
Change levels. Change levels.
 

1049
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,790
Change levels. Change levels.
Now leave that where it is and go

1050
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
Now leave that where it is and go
 

1051
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,670
Now leave that where it is and go
forward into her center, not around her

1052
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
forward into her center, not around her
 

1053
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,630
forward into her center, not around her
center.

1054
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
center.
 

1055
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,670
center.
There you go. If that's what it looks

1056
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
There you go. If that's what it looks
 

1057
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,750
There you go. If that's what it looks
like you're trying for that, that's how

1058
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
like you're trying for that, that's how
 

1059
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:34,230
like you're trying for that, that's how
you would do that.

1060
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240

 

1061
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:58,950

Change heights.

1062
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960

 

1063
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:11,430

Change heights. Change heights.

1064
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440

 

1065
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,910

So when I think spiral rotate, I think

1066
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
So when I think spiral rotate, I think
 

1067
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,470
So when I think spiral rotate, I think
like a orbitron on a corkcrew roller

1068
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:16,480
like a orbitron on a corkcrew roller
 

1069
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,910
like a orbitron on a corkcrew roller
coaster.

1070
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:17,920
coaster.
 

1071
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,109
coaster.
You remember what a Obitron was? Was a

1072
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
You remember what a Obitron was? Was a
 

1073
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,870
You remember what a Obitron was? Was a
carnival ride. You sit in the middle of

1074
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
carnival ride. You sit in the middle of
 

1075
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,670
carnival ride. You sit in the middle of
it and it goes all 360. Okay. Now

1076
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
it and it goes all 360. Okay. Now
 

1077
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,829
it and it goes all 360. Okay. Now
imagine one of those on a corkcrew

1078
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
imagine one of those on a corkcrew
 

1079
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,670
imagine one of those on a corkcrew
roller coaster.

1080
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
roller coaster.
 

1081
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,829
roller coaster.
>> Okay. That's what I mean by spiral

1082
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
>> Okay. That's what I mean by spiral
 

1083
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:41,510
>> Okay. That's what I mean by spiral
rotate.

1084
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520

 

1085
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:52,309

So my hands have to do different things.

1086
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319

 

1087
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,230

Never lose the front foot if that's the

1088
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
Never lose the front foot if that's the
 

1089
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:04,150
Never lose the front foot if that's the
one that's grounding.

1090
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160

 

1091
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,030

What one feels y don't push through. Go

1092
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040
What one feels y don't push through. Go
 

1093
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,109
What one feels y don't push through. Go
to the other hand. It's the universe. So

1094
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:09,119
to the other hand. It's the universe. So
 

1095
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,750
to the other hand. It's the universe. So
if one hand feels yang and you had a yin

1096
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
if one hand feels yang and you had a yin
 

1097
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,910
if one hand feels yang and you had a yin
and a yang hand, the other hand has

1098
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:13,920
and a yang hand, the other hand has
 

1099
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,710
and a yang hand, the other hand has
room. Okay. So, you go to the other

1100
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
room. Okay. So, you go to the other
 

1101
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,309
room. Okay. So, you go to the other
hand,

1102
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:20,319

 

1103
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,710

change levels.

1104
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720

 

1105
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,190

Okay. So, the right probably feels yang.

1106
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
Okay. So, the right probably feels yang.
 

1107
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,510
Okay. So, the right probably feels yang.
So, the left is going to be in a yin

1108
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,520
So, the left is going to be in a yin
 

1109
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,990
So, the left is going to be in a yin
phase. Has more yang potential. You go

1110
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,000
phase. Has more yang potential. You go
 

1111
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,430
phase. Has more yang potential. You go
to it

1112
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440

 

1113
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,030

and never predict.

1114
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040

 

1115
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,829

>> So, feels tight. So then the other one

1116
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
>> So, feels tight. So then the other one
 

1117
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,990
>> So, feels tight. So then the other one
comes around.

1118
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,000
comes around.
 

1119
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,790
comes around.
Yes. Do you do you do you get what I'm

1120
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,800
Yes. Do you do you do you get what I'm
 

1121
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,950
Yes. Do you do you do you get what I'm
saying for real?

1122
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
saying for real?
 

1123
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,270
saying for real?
>> Yes.

1124
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
>> Yes.
 

1125
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,430
>> Yes.
>> Okay. So because it because it's a

1126
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440
>> Okay. So because it because it's a
 

1127
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,630
>> Okay. So because it because it's a
cosmogonic truth. Okay. That if I get

1128
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
cosmogonic truth. Okay. That if I get
 

1129
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,190
cosmogonic truth. Okay. That if I get
these things going, do you get it? So

1130
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
these things going, do you get it? So
 

1131
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,630
these things going, do you get it? So
let's push push really hard on this

1132
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
let's push push really hard on this
 

1133
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,870
let's push push really hard on this
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is

1134
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is
 

1135
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,150
hand. Do you see that? Well, this one is
now in a yin phase.

1136
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160

 

1137
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,550

I I don't know why and I don't care why.

1138
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
I I don't know why and I don't care why.
 

1139
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,710
I I don't know why and I don't care why.
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.

1140
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.
 

1141
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,750
Okay. So, the other we do the other one.
We'll get there again. Okay. And now

1142
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
We'll get there again. Okay. And now
 

1143
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,150
We'll get there again. Okay. And now
lift up really high on that hand. And

1144
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,160
lift up really high on that hand. And
 

1145
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,150
lift up really high on that hand. And
your instinct is to shove down here. But

1146
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
your instinct is to shove down here. But
 

1147
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,069
your instinct is to shove down here. But
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So

1148
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So
 

1149
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,950
now this one goes in. Do you get it? So
you already know that. So when you feel

1150
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
you already know that. So when you feel
 

1151
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,109
you already know that. So when you feel
the the force in your own body

1152
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
the the force in your own body
 

1153
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,510
the the force in your own body
stop and you go to the other hand, it

1154
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
stop and you go to the other hand, it
 

1155
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,589
stop and you go to the other hand, it
will be in the yin phase. Okay.

1156
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
will be in the yin phase. Okay.
 

1157
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,910
will be in the yin phase. Okay.
>> Okay. If you can't feel it, you should

1158
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
>> Okay. If you can't feel it, you should
 

1159
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,670
>> Okay. If you can't feel it, you should
be able to feel it, but if you can't

1160
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
be able to feel it, but if you can't
 

1161
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,150
be able to feel it, but if you can't
feel it, you can cosmogonically

1162
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,160
feel it, you can cosmogonically
 

1163
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,390
feel it, you can cosmogonically
map it. It's going to be open.

1164
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
map it. It's going to be open.
 

1165
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,190
map it. It's going to be open.
>> Okay. It's like a app that tells you

1166
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,200
>> Okay. It's like a app that tells you
 

1167
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,230
>> Okay. It's like a app that tells you
that Starbucks is open. Okay.

1168
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
that Starbucks is open. Okay.
 

1169
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,630
that Starbucks is open. Okay.
>> On your road trips. Yes.

1170
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640

 

1171
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,670

>> Then you did not generate a yin and a

1172
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
>> Then you did not generate a yin and a
 

1173
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,550
>> Then you did not generate a yin and a
yang hand. You did not spiral rotate the

1174
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:08,560
yang hand. You did not spiral rotate the
 

1175
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,510
yang hand. You did not spiral rotate the
fight.

1176
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
fight.
 

1177
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:18,790
fight.
>> Okay. Yeah. So, first do that

1178
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800

 

1179
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,710

and take one take them both as far as

1180
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:20,720
and take one take them both as far as
 

1181
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:31,990
and take one take them both as far as
they can go and one will go further.

1182
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000

 

1183
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,589

See how your hands are in that same

1184
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
See how your hands are in that same
 

1185
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:46,790
See how your hands are in that same
level.

1186
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800

 

1187
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,230

So, here's here's what I mean. Uh, you

1188
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,240
So, here's here's what I mean. Uh, you
 

1189
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,109
So, here's here's what I mean. Uh, you
get stuck on

1190
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
get stuck on
 

1191
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,829
get stuck on
that she's she's pulling you. Do you get

1192
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:55,839
that she's she's pulling you. Do you get
 

1193
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,950
that she's she's pulling you. Do you get
that? And you try to do something on one

1194
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
that? And you try to do something on one
 

1195
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,030
that? And you try to do something on one
hand, but now that you left that hand

1196
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,040
hand, but now that you left that hand
 

1197
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,910
hand, but now that you left that hand
dead. Do do you you're being

1198
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
dead. Do do you you're being
 

1199
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,069
dead. Do do you you're being
cosmogonically mapped. So as you did

1200
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:06,079
cosmogonically mapped. So as you did
 

1201
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,549
cosmogonically mapped. So as you did
something with one hand, that hand went

1202
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
something with one hand, that hand went
 

1203
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,430
something with one hand, that hand went
yong and this hand went yin.

1204
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:11,440
yong and this hand went yin.
 

1205
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,270
yong and this hand went yin.
So you didn't do anything with it.

1206
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
So you didn't do anything with it.
 

1207
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,589
So you didn't do anything with it.
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always

1208
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:15,599
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always
 

1209
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,349
>> So as she goes to pull in, you're always
doing something with the two hands

1210
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:17,359
doing something with the two hands
 

1211
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:23,190
doing something with the two hands
together. Always doing something.

1212
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200

 

1213
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,349

>> Don't get f focused. Usually what

1214
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
>> Don't get f focused. Usually what
 

1215
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,349
>> Don't get f focused. Usually what
happens is she pulls and you feel one of

1216
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
happens is she pulls and you feel one of
 

1217
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,109
happens is she pulls and you feel one of
them's taking your balance more than the

1218
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,119
them's taking your balance more than the
 

1219
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,190
them's taking your balance more than the
other one. So that's the one that you

1220
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,200
other one. So that's the one that you
 

1221
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,309
other one. So that's the one that you
focus on. And this hand went dead. So

1222
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
focus on. And this hand went dead. So
 

1223
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,990
focus on. And this hand went dead. So
she's going. You can see how this

1224
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
she's going. You can see how this
 

1225
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,750
she's going. You can see how this
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?

1226
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?
 

1227
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,910
elbow's anchored more. Do you see that?
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity

1228
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity
 

1229
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,829
So I feel my b I feel my line of gravity
being taken that way. Okay. So again,

1230
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:43,839
being taken that way. Okay. So again,
 

1231
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,270
being taken that way. Okay. So again,
that's only a problem if you're not

1232
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
that's only a problem if you're not
 

1233
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,950
that's only a problem if you're not
grounding because if you are grounding,

1234
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
grounding because if you are grounding,
 

1235
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,870
grounding because if you are grounding,
go ahead. My line of gravity never

1236
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
go ahead. My line of gravity never
 

1237
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,150
go ahead. My line of gravity never
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,

1238
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,
 

1239
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,829
moves. Okay. But if should that happen,
then you this is where your attention

1240
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:53,839
then you this is where your attention
 

1241
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,790
then you this is where your attention
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.

1242
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:56,800
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.
 

1243
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,309
goes. You'll feel that it's very yin.
It's like her she didn't even have

1244
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
It's like her she didn't even have
 

1245
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,990
It's like her she didn't even have
anything on the other hand because she

1246
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
anything on the other hand because she
 

1247
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,390
anything on the other hand because she
was being cosmogonically mapped and she

1248
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
was being cosmogonically mapped and she
 

1249
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,390
was being cosmogonically mapped and she
overemphasized one hand gave me the

1250
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:04,400
overemphasized one hand gave me the
 

1251
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,309
overemphasized one hand gave me the
other hand. Okay. But if you're

1252
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
other hand. Okay. But if you're
 

1253
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,870
other hand. Okay. But if you're
grounding it's a moot point. Okay.

1254
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880
grounding it's a moot point. Okay.
 

1255
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,829
grounding it's a moot point. Okay.
You could do it any old way is what I

1256
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
You could do it any old way is what I
 

1257
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:38,549
You could do it any old way is what I
mean. You could done either side.

1258
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:38,559

 

1259
00:50:38,559 --> 00:51:02,950

See, our hands are on the table.

1260
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960

 

1261
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,870

don't come off the ground vector of the

1262
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:04,880
don't come off the ground vector of the
 

1263
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,790
don't come off the ground vector of the
front foot.

1264
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800

 

1265
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,109

And then each hand follows that yinyang

1266
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
And then each hand follows that yinyang
 

1267
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,710
And then each hand follows that yinyang
rule. So you you I did go to the other

1268
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
rule. So you you I did go to the other
 

1269
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,470
rule. So you you I did go to the other
hand if I felt this hand is at max yong

1270
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
hand if I felt this hand is at max yong
 

1271
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,309
hand if I felt this hand is at max yong
now I would be yong yong clashing. Okay

1272
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:26,319
now I would be yong yong clashing. Okay
 

1273
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,190
now I would be yong yong clashing. Okay
max yong is their yong value. Okay so if

1274
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
max yong is their yong value. Okay so if
 

1275
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,430
max yong is their yong value. Okay so if
you push past it that's a yong clash.

1276
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
you push past it that's a yong clash.
 

1277
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,870
you push past it that's a yong clash.
Okay. So, what I first explained was I

1278
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
Okay. So, what I first explained was I
 

1279
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,390
Okay. So, what I first explained was I
if you get at that max yong on that

1280
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
if you get at that max yong on that
 

1281
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,510
if you get at that max yong on that
contact point, I should have said that

1282
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
contact point, I should have said that
 

1283
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,230
contact point, I should have said that
the other hand will be in a yin phase.

1284
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,240
the other hand will be in a yin phase.
 

1285
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,349
the other hand will be in a yin phase.
But at each hand, it's that contact

1286
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
But at each hand, it's that contact
 

1287
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,309
But at each hand, it's that contact
point that is at max yong, not the next

1288
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319
point that is at max yong, not the next
 

1289
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,190
point that is at max yong, not the next
contact point on that hand.

1290
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
contact point on that hand.
 

1291
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,069
contact point on that hand.
Okay? So, because you you got there, so

1292
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
Okay? So, because you you got there, so
 

1293
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,589
Okay? So, because you you got there, so
we'll use you again. Okay? So you're

1294
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599
we'll use you again. Okay? So you're
 

1295
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,790
we'll use you again. Okay? So you're
you're uh going here and that's where

1296
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
you're uh going here and that's where
 

1297
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,109
you're uh going here and that's where
you felt that. Do you see that?

1298
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
you felt that. Do you see that?
 

1299
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,309
you felt that. Do you see that?
>> It's it's this relationship that's in

1300
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:10,319
>> It's it's this relationship that's in
 

1301
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,390
>> It's it's this relationship that's in
the yong face. Do you got it?

1302
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
the yong face. Do you got it?
 

1303
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,349
the yong face. Do you got it?
>> So she as she's here when I go here, do

1304
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
>> So she as she's here when I go here, do
 

1305
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,309
>> So she as she's here when I go here, do
you see

1306
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
you see
 

1307
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,510
you see
>> it's not in the young face?

1308
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
>> it's not in the young face?
 

1309
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:38,309
>> it's not in the young face?
>> So come back.

1310
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319

 

1311
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,150

So come back and you'll see what I did.

1312
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,160
So come back and you'll see what I did.
 

1313
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,950
So come back and you'll see what I did.
>> It's you lifting up

1314
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
>> It's you lifting up
 

1315
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,430
>> It's you lifting up
>> and me pushing down. That's the yong

1316
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
>> and me pushing down. That's the yong
 

1317
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,190
>> and me pushing down. That's the yong
face. Do you see that?

1318
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
face. Do you see that?
 

1319
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,030
face. Do you see that?
>> Then you can leave that where it is. And

1320
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
>> Then you can leave that where it is. And
 

1321
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,349
>> Then you can leave that where it is. And
this hound will have yin space. Okay?

1322
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
this hound will have yin space. Okay?
 

1323
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,950
this hound will have yin space. Okay?
>> Or you can change this hound. And I did

1324
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
>> Or you can change this hound. And I did
 

1325
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,270
>> Or you can change this hound. And I did
and I went this way.

1326
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
and I went this way.
 

1327
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,589
and I went this way.
>> And you'll find more yin space. Okay?

1328
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:05,599
>> And you'll find more yin space. Okay?
 

1329
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,990
>> And you'll find more yin space. Okay?
That's what I mean. Okay? You don't have

1330
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,000
That's what I mean. Okay? You don't have
 

1331
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,950
That's what I mean. Okay? You don't have
to. And you shouldn't be trapped in that

1332
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:10,960
to. And you shouldn't be trapped in that
 

1333
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,510
to. And you shouldn't be trapped in that
yang phase. We because the trapping is

1334
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:13,520
yang phase. We because the trapping is
 

1335
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,630
yang phase. We because the trapping is
the bad part. Not not that it was at a

1336
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
the bad part. Not not that it was at a
 

1337
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,710
the bad part. Not not that it was at a
yang phase and then you went yin on the

1338
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
yang phase and then you went yin on the
 

1339
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,349
yang phase and then you went yin on the
other hand. It's I can tell your mind is

1340
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
other hand. It's I can tell your mind is
 

1341
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,750
other hand. It's I can tell your mind is
just stuck on it. That's the bad part.

1342
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
just stuck on it. That's the bad part.
 

1343
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:33,510
just stuck on it. That's the bad part.
Okay, try it again.

1344
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,520

 

1345
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,069

Distinct yinyong.

1346
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079

 

1347
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,309

So, right there on your right hand, if

1348
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
So, right there on your right hand, if
 

1349
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,790
So, right there on your right hand, if
you just point, stop trying to touch her

1350
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
you just point, stop trying to touch her
 

1351
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,670
you just point, stop trying to touch her
and point your fingers more down

1352
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
and point your fingers more down
 

1353
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,589
and point your fingers more down
straight. Yeah. Do you see? You'll have

1354
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
straight. Yeah. Do you see? You'll have
 

1355
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:55,910
straight. Yeah. Do you see? You'll have
more room. Okay,

1356
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920

 

1357
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,230

>> you can do it here again. Point them

1358
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
>> you can do it here again. Point them
 

1359
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,390
>> you can do it here again. Point them
down. Just down. Just down. Just point

1360
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
down. Just down. Just down. Just point
 

1361
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:24,309
down. Just down. Just down. Just point
down until that runs out.

1362
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319

 

1363
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,309

and you know if it got stuck it's the

1364
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
and you know if it got stuck it's the
 

1365
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,950
and you know if it got stuck it's the
other hand you just go to the other hand

1366
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
other hand you just go to the other hand
 

1367
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,069
other hand you just go to the other hand
don't don't Yes.

1368
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,079
don't don't Yes.
 

1369
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,470
don't don't Yes.
But what happened is she shifted her she

1370
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:36,480
But what happened is she shifted her she
 

1371
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,630
But what happened is she shifted her she
changed your contact point on your right

1372
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
changed your contact point on your right
 

1373
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,870
changed your contact point on your right
hand with her left hand and then it

1374
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:40,880
hand with her left hand and then it
 

1375
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,549
hand with her left hand and then it
captured your mind and then you

1376
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
captured your mind and then you
 

1377
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,190
captured your mind and then you
contested on that new contact point that

1378
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
contested on that new contact point that
 

1379
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,349
contested on that new contact point that
she regained her leverage on and then

1380
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:47,359
she regained her leverage on and then
 

1381
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,190
she regained her leverage on and then
you had to be told the other hand is

1382
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
you had to be told the other hand is
 

1383
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,270
you had to be told the other hand is
available. Okay. So you don't want to be

1384
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
available. Okay. So you don't want to be
 

1385
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,190
available. Okay. So you don't want to be
trapped like that.

1386
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200

 

1387
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,510

That's what we mean by release. I don't

1388
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
That's what we mean by release. I don't
 

1389
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:06,390
That's what we mean by release. I don't
get trapped.

1390
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:06,400

 

1391
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:29,349

Your feet too don't have to get trapped.

1392
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359

 

1393
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,190

The stink yin and yong hand from the

1394
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:31,200
The stink yin and yong hand from the
 

1395
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:38,630
The stink yin and yong hand from the
beginning. Try it again.

1396
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640

 

1397
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,630

Go around it. Go around it. No. Go

1398
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
Go around it. Go around it. No. Go
 

1399
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,069
Go around it. Go around it. No. Go
around it. Don't Don't Don't try to do

1400
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
around it. Don't Don't Don't try to do
 

1401
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:58,470
around it. Don't Don't Don't try to do
something to it.

1402
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480

 

1403
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,190

See how you see how you pull you pulling

1404
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
See how you see how you pull you pulling
 

1405
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,990
See how you see how you pull you pulling
that hand. Did you feel that pull? Okay.

1406
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
that hand. Did you feel that pull? Okay.
 

1407
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,150
that hand. Did you feel that pull? Okay.
So, the other thing you can do is with

1408
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:06,160
So, the other thing you can do is with
 

1409
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,069
So, the other thing you can do is with
your body. Okay. So, you're you got here

1410
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
your body. Okay. So, you're you got here
 

1411
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,349
your body. Okay. So, you're you got here
like that and then pulling that out. Do

1412
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
like that and then pulling that out. Do
 

1413
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,630
like that and then pulling that out. Do
you see that? Okay. So, the reason that

1414
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
you see that? Okay. So, the reason that
 

1415
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,030
you see that? Okay. So, the reason that
you're pulling that out is because it's

1416
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040
you're pulling that out is because it's
 

1417
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,670
you're pulling that out is because it's
relationship to your center. My center

1418
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
relationship to your center. My center
 

1419
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,309
relationship to your center. My center
is on the is on the other side and the

1420
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
is on the is on the other side and the
 

1421
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,390
is on the is on the other side and the
active qua

1422
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
active qua
 

1423
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,190
active qua
can't get to push on there. So, you can

1424
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
can't get to push on there. So, you can
 

1425
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,430
can't get to push on there. So, you can
get it to where you want it to be. And

1426
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
get it to where you want it to be. And
 

1427
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,349
get it to where you want it to be. And
look how I shifted weight. Do you see

1428
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
look how I shifted weight. Do you see
 

1429
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,470
look how I shifted weight. Do you see
that? Okay. And now my body's not

1430
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
that? Okay. And now my body's not
 

1431
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,349
that? Okay. And now my body's not
pulling it on the outer deltoid.

1432
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
pulling it on the outer deltoid.
 

1433
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,270
pulling it on the outer deltoid.
>> So, you're you're over here and you're

1434
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
>> So, you're you're over here and you're
 

1435
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,069
>> So, you're you're over here and you're
trying to pull it across. Yeah, you

1436
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
trying to pull it across. Yeah, you
 

1437
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,150
trying to pull it across. Yeah, you
can't move the other side and then you

1438
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
can't move the other side and then you
 

1439
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,470
can't move the other side and then you
rotate the qua

1440
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:48,480
rotate the qua
 

1441
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,470
rotate the qua
and it goes

1442
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
and it goes
 

1443
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,150
and it goes
yin again. Okay, so the hands are yin

1444
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
yin again. Okay, so the hands are yin
 

1445
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,630
yin again. Okay, so the hands are yin
and yang to each other. The hand is yin

1446
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:56,640
and yang to each other. The hand is yin
 

1447
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,430
and yang to each other. The hand is yin
and yang to each other and the hand is

1448
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
and yang to each other and the hand is
 

1449
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,150
and yang to each other and the hand is
the arms are yin and yang to what my qua

1450
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
the arms are yin and yang to what my qua
 

1451
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,750
the arms are yin and yang to what my qua
and center is doing. Okay.

1452
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,760
and center is doing. Okay.
 

1453
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,270
and center is doing. Okay.
>> Okay.

1454
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,280

 

1455
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,309

It's too much to remember that and I

1456
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
It's too much to remember that and I
 

1457
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,630
It's too much to remember that and I
that's why you just find the feeling and

1458
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
that's why you just find the feeling and
 

1459
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:21,190
that's why you just find the feeling and
the release.

1460
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200

 

1461
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,910

>> So you had a yin yield and then the

1462
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:23,920
>> So you had a yin yield and then the
 

1463
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,190
>> So you had a yin yield and then the
spine is available.

1464
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
spine is available.
 

1465
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,789
spine is available.
I know it feels like I'm beating the

1466
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
I know it feels like I'm beating the
 

1467
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,109
I know it feels like I'm beating the
crap out of you when I go to your spine,

1468
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
crap out of you when I go to your spine,
 

1469
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,190
crap out of you when I go to your spine,
but if you watch the video, it's just

1470
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,200
but if you watch the video, it's just
 

1471
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,309
but if you watch the video, it's just
slow. It's just that's how much the

1472
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
slow. It's just that's how much the
 

1473
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,150
slow. It's just that's how much the
direct control is because we now have

1474
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
direct control is because we now have
 

1475
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,950
direct control is because we now have
more uh we've bridged more towards

more uh we've bridged more towards
 

1477
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,470
more uh we've bridged more towards
close-range grappling with the

00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
close-range grappling with the
 

1479
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,270
close-range grappling with the
internals. Do you get that? So, when you

1480
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280

It's probably because you're you're
bracing by squatting back. Your line of

to always think about that. Um let's say
 

1605
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,349
to always think about that. Um let's say
she's in that in this stance. Do you see

1606
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
she's in that in this stance. Do you see

she's in that in this stance. Do you see
she's in Ihan me? Uh if you take her to

1608
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:36,880
she's in Ihan me? Uh if you take her to
 

1609
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,190
she's in Ihan me? Uh if you take her to
this to this way, she'll always be able

1610
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,200
this to this way, she'll always be able
 

1611
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,150
this to this way, she'll always be able
to step into that. Do you see? If you

1612
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
to step into that. Do you see? If you
 

1613
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,030
to step into that. Do you see? If you
take her the other way, then you get her

1614
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,040
take her the other way, then you get her
 

1615
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,630
take her the other way, then you get her
outside that edge. She has that

1616
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
outside that edge. She has that
 

1617
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,030
outside that edge. She has that
awkwardness. Okay? Do do you understand?

So, I think you're just kind of picking
what's comfortable for you regardless of

01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,189
and you go further down the roller
coaster line. No, it's always going to

1944
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
coaster line. No, it's always going to
 

1945
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,870
coaster line. No, it's always going to
be better to intern turn there because

1946
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
be better to intern turn there because
 

1947
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,390
be better to intern turn there because
your your center is on the east side of

1948
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
your your center is on the east side of
 

1949
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,950
your your center is on the east side of
it. So when you go backwards on someone

1950
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
it. So when you go backwards on someone
 

1951
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,430
it. So when you go backwards on someone
that's pulling, you're going to clash.

1952
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
that's pulling, you're going to clash.
 

1953
