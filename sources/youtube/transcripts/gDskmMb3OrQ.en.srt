35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,469

okay you're giving yourself a backf foot

36
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:07,479
okay you're giving yourself a backf foot
 

37
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,510
okay you're giving yourself a backf foot
bracing angle did you

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520

 

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,869

see whoa you actually

40
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879

43
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,229

go and you leaned forward right that's a

44
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,239
go and you leaned forward right that's a
 

45
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,309
go and you leaned forward right that's a
bracing angle too right

46
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,319

 

47
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:44,390

okay

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400

 

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:54,949

good and bring it down to your lower

50
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959

 

51
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,830

legs lower

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840

 

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,789

legs

54
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:07,799

 

55
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,110

all right do do you uh feel tension

56
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,120
all right do do you uh feel tension
 

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,070
all right do do you uh feel tension
coming into your body as you try to do

58
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
coming into your body as you try to do
 

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,430
coming into your body as you try to do
it okay and that that's the point of the

60
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
it okay and that that's the point of the
 

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,830
it okay and that that's the point of the
drill is uh to bring awareness to that

62
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:20,840
drill is uh to bring awareness to that
 

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,350
drill is uh to bring awareness to that
tension

64
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,360
tension
 

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,910
tension
okay

66
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:24,920
okay
 

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,750
okay
um here the tension won't serve you here

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,760
um here the tension won't serve you here
 

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,789
um here the tension won't serve you here
in this drill the tension is going to

70
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
in this drill the tension is going to
 

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,429
in this drill the tension is going to
make you go backwards right uh because

72
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:35,439
make you go backwards right uh because
 

73
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,190
make you go backwards right uh because
that tension is from a

74
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200
that tension is from a
 

75
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,949
that tension is from a
dichotomist worldview and they have all

76
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:41,959
dichotomist worldview and they have all
 

77
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,869
dichotomist worldview and they have all
the inertia the bracing angle uh their

78
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:45,879
the inertia the bracing angle uh their
 

79
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,149
the inertia the bracing angle uh their
action and you tend to either have

80
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
action and you tend to either have
 

81
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,670
action and you tend to either have
nothing because they

82
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
nothing because they
 

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,429
nothing because they
stopped or uh you get pushed back does

84
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:54,439
stopped or uh you get pushed back does
 

85
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,350
stopped or uh you get pushed back does
that make sense okay whereas in the in

86
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
that make sense okay whereas in the in
 

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,710
that make sense okay whereas in the in
the other

88
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
the other
 

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,670
the other
ones

90
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:00,680
ones
 

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,309
ones
you you get your back foot like you

92
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
you you get your back foot like you
 

93
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,789
you you get your back foot like you
wanted a back foot you see and that

94
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
wanted a back foot you see and that
 

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,110
wanted a back foot you see and that
means I'm probably using my back foot is

96
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,120
means I'm probably using my back foot is
 

97
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,429
means I'm probably using my back foot is
a bracing angle without realizing it

98
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
a bracing angle without realizing it
 

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,229
a bracing angle without realizing it
okay do you guys get that okay

100
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
okay do you guys get that okay
 

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,670
okay do you guys get that okay
so um some of some of the

102
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,680
so um some of some of the
 

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,749
so um some of some of the
more advanced in this skill your arms

104
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
more advanced in this skill your arms
 

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,430
more advanced in this skill your arms
are relaxed which is really good you got

106
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,440
are relaxed which is really good you got
 

107
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,390
are relaxed which is really good you got
to start there um but the legs are still

108
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
to start there um but the legs are still
 

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,350
to start there um but the legs are still
have some you still go whoa and you

110
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,360
have some you still go whoa and you
 

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,310
have some you still go whoa and you
still hold that and there's flexion in

112
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
still hold that and there's flexion in
 

113
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
still hold that and there's flexion in
through the in through the glutes okay

114
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
through the in through the glutes okay
 

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,550
through the in through the glutes okay
and down through the lower legs um okay

116
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
and down through the lower legs um okay
 

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,950
and down through the lower legs um okay
why because that's where you feel the

118
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:41,960
why because that's where you feel the
 

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,189
why because that's where you feel the
dichotomy but subjectively you're

120
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:44,199
dichotomy but subjectively you're
 

121
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,909
dichotomy but subjectively you're
experiencing as I'm not going to make it

122
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:46,919
experiencing as I'm not going to make it
 

123
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,870
experiencing as I'm not going to make it
or they're going to get me do you see

124
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
or they're going to get me do you see
 

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,950
or they're going to get me do you see
that it's very it's an egocentricity

126
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
that it's very it's an egocentricity
 

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,550
that it's very it's an egocentricity
that happens and it is concentric with

128
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
that happens and it is concentric with
 

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,790
that happens and it is concentric with
that flexion so you have to bring some

130
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:57,800
that flexion so you have to bring some
 

131
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,189
that flexion so you have to bring some
awareness to the flexion to identify the

132
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
awareness to the flexion to identify the
 

133
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,270
awareness to the flexion to identify the
problem and then you have to do the

134
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
problem and then you have to do the
 

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,110
problem and then you have to do the
remedy and the remedy is is uh self-

136
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
remedy and the remedy is is uh self-
 

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,870
remedy and the remedy is is uh self-

okay any questions on
that so as I'm trying to do this drill I

142
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
that so as I'm trying to do this drill I
 

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,990
that so as I'm trying to do this drill I
try to release release all the way down

144
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,000
try to release release all the way down
 

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,150
try to release release all the way down
just release

146
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
just release
 

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,469
just release
release I'll feel that come in right

148
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:23,479
release I'll feel that come in right
 

149
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,350
release I'll feel that come in right
here I felt it do you see or I release

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,000
it and I get reps that release
 

153
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,309
it and I get reps that release
it's not so much that I'm in a released

154
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,319
it's not so much that I'm in a released
 

155
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,029
it's not so much that I'm in a released
State and I I want to do that I want to

it okay let's let's see but let's have
 

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,390
it okay let's let's see but let's have
you try that I think most of you will

172
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,400
you try that I think most of you will
 

173
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,230
you try that I think most of you will
get in trouble and be bounced off

174
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
get in trouble and be bounced off
 

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,830
get in trouble and be bounced off
because the antagonism shows up but

176
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:06,840
because the antagonism shows up but
 

177
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,430
because the antagonism shows up but
maybe a couple of you can get in trouble

178
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,440
maybe a couple of you can get in trouble
 

179
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,749
maybe a couple of you can get in trouble
release and you'll get that skill which

180
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
release and you'll get that skill which
 

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,350
release and you'll get that skill which
is the skill you want which is the

182
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
is the skill you want which is the
 

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,629
is the skill you want which is the
releasing skill because the ego Tri

184
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
releasing skill because the ego Tri
 

185
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,550
releasing skill because the ego Tri
partti mind never goes away it's always

186
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
partti mind never goes away it's always
 

187
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,870
partti mind never goes away it's always
there and we need that skill to be able

188
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:23,880
there and we need that skill to be able
 

189
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,189
there and we need that skill to be able
to balance out the two minds do you guys

190
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
to balance out the two minds do you guys
 

191
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,550
to balance out the two minds do you guys
understand all right let's see what

192
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
understand all right let's see what
 

193
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,710
understand all right let's see what
we

194
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,720

 

195
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,790

often times we'll look at

196
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:35,800
often times we'll look at
 

197
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,589
often times we'll look at
that and we're going to think it's a

198
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:38,599
that and we're going to think it's a
 

199
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,710
that and we're going to think it's a
physical problem but it's it's not a

200
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:41,720
physical problem but it's it's not a
 

201
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,909
physical problem but it's it's not a
physical problem it's a mind problem

202
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
physical problem it's a mind problem
 

203
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,309
physical problem it's a mind problem
okay so yes I do Flex yeah but and yes

204
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
okay so yes I do Flex yeah but and yes
 

205
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,589
okay so yes I do Flex yeah but and yes
that's physiology but I'm flexing

206
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
that's physiology but I'm flexing
 

207
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,870
that's physiology but I'm flexing
because I'm antagonistically

208
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
because I'm antagonistically
 

209
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,270
because I'm antagonistically
experiencing the relationship and that

210
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
experiencing the relationship and that
 

211
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,790
experiencing the relationship and that
is not a physical problem that's a mind

212
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
is not a physical problem that's a mind
 

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,189
is not a physical problem that's a mind
problem okay and then it concentrically

214
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
problem okay and then it concentrically
 

215
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,710
problem okay and then it concentrically
manifests physiologically do do you guys

216
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:03,720
manifests physiologically do do you guys
 

217
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,230
manifests physiologically do do you guys
understand okay so for example as as

trouble get you might be thinking I'm in

222
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
trouble get you might be thinking I'm in
 

223
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,830

I'm in trouble because I had that mind

226
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:19,879
I'm in trouble because I had that mind
 

227
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:28,510
I'm in trouble because I had that mind
so you as you're free you could

228
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520

 

229
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,309

do

230
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319

 

231
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,950

never in trouble do do you understand

232
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
never in trouble do do you understand
 

233
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,350
never in trouble do do you understand
that do you get that I know it's weird

234
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360
that do you get that I know it's weird
 

235
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,869
that do you get that I know it's weird
because you're like wait where is that

236
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:43,879
because you're like wait where is that
 

237
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,309
because you're like wait where is that
where's the anatomical positioning but

238
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
where's the anatomical positioning but
 

239
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,430
where's the anatomical positioning but
that's what had you in these bracing

240
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,440
that's what had you in these bracing
 

241
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,830
that's what had you in these bracing
angles and the skeletal alignment in the

242
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,840
angles and the skeletal alignment in the
 

243
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,309
angles and the skeletal alignment in the
first place you see but you if you don't

244
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
first place you see but you if you don't
 

245
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,670
first place you see but you if you don't
ever have that antagonism you could be

246
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:56,680
ever have that antagonism you could be
 

247
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:17,469
ever have that antagonism you could be
in weird ass places weird

248
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:17,479

 

249
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,589

and it'll it's going to work okay like

250
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
and it'll it's going to work okay like
 

251
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,430
and it'll it's going to work okay like
very do you

252
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440

 

253
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:40,310

see

254
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320

 

255
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,509

that should not be

256
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:42,519
that should not be
 

257
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,350
that should not be
doable got do you understand okay so um

258
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
doable got do you understand okay so um
 

259
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,070
doable got do you understand okay so um
it's really in the mind that's why I

260
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,080
it's really in the mind that's why I

your self- Detachment practices because

264
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,240
your self- Detachment practices because
 

265
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,870
your self- Detachment practices because
this can be one but even in the practice

266
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
this can be one but even in the practice

of it
I'm I'm kind of like got in trouble oh I

270
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm I'm kind of like got in trouble oh I
 

271
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,150
I'm I'm kind of like got in trouble oh I
shouldn't even be thinking about this

272
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
shouldn't even be thinking about this
 

273
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,190
shouldn't even be thinking about this
okay and here's here's why so let's say

274
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
okay and here's here's why so let's say
 

275
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,350
okay and here's here's why so let's say
I'm

I'm
 

277
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,710
I'm
doing aido okay Kon Wasa and you could

278
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
doing aido okay Kon Wasa and you could
 

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,269
doing aido okay Kon Wasa and you could
see there's a skeletal alignment is is

280
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:18,279
see there's a skeletal alignment is is
 

281
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,350
see there's a skeletal alignment is is
really what I'm using even though I

282
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,360
really what I'm using even though I
 

283
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,750
really what I'm using even though I
don't have the obvious A-frame it's

284
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:22,760
don't have the obvious A-frame it's
 

285
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,430
don't have the obvious A-frame it's
still a bracing angle here it's a

286
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
still a bracing angle here it's a
 

287
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,190
still a bracing angle here it's a
different feeling you see it's a

288
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,200
different feeling you see it's a
 

289
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,389
different feeling you see it's a
different feeling when you're doing

290
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:29,399
different feeling when you're doing
 

291
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,430
different feeling when you're doing
doing it right it look it kind I think

292
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
doing it right it look it kind I think
 

293
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,910
doing it right it look it kind I think
anyone that can knows what to look for

294
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:34,920
anyone that can knows what to look for
 

295
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,870
anyone that can knows what to look for
would see the high glute the tension in

296
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
would see the high glute the tension in
 

297
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,069
would see the high glute the tension in
the lower leg and the the need for that

298
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:42,079
the lower leg and the the need for that
 

299
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:44,550
the lower leg and the the need for that
skeletal alignment even in the in the

300
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
skeletal alignment even in the in the
 

301
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,630
skeletal alignment even in the in the
way that the uh L the the pseudo L lon's

302
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:49,640
way that the uh L the the pseudo L lon's
 

303
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,470

face is uh I'm sorry is constructed so

304
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
face is uh I'm sorry is constructed so
 

305
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,750
face is uh I'm sorry is constructed so
you're like this you see as opposed to

306
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
you're like this you see as opposed to
 

307
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,069
you're like this you see as opposed to
your your these metacarpal are opening

308
00:09:59,069 --> 00:09:59,079
your your these metacarpal are opening
 

309
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,190
your your these metacarpal are opening
okay and so it's it's a different

310
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
okay and so it's it's a different
 

311
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,350
okay and so it's it's a different
feeling and so it does different things

312
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
feeling and so it does different things
 

313
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,750
feeling and so it does different things
to the person as you're moving

314
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760

 

315
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,870

around okay

316
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
around okay
 

317
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,269
around okay
so let us realize

318
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:14,279
so let us realize
 

319
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,870
so let us realize
why we want to get away from a skeletal

320
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:17,880
why we want to get away from a skeletal
 

321
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,670
why we want to get away from a skeletal
alment okay spiritually it's

322
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
alment okay spiritually it's
 

323
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,269
alment okay spiritually it's
antagonistic so spiritually it's fear

324
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:24,279
antagonistic so spiritually it's fear
 

325
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,949
antagonistic so spiritually it's fear
based it's ego triar mind based and we

326
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:27,959
based it's ego triar mind based and we
 

327
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,110
based it's ego triar mind based and we
want to realize the difficult difficulty

328
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,120
want to realize the difficult difficulty
 

329
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,150
want to realize the difficult difficulty
in identifying where we're doing it

330
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,160
in identifying where we're doing it
 

331
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,870
in identifying where we're doing it
because there's a lot of people that

332
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
because there's a lot of people that
 

333
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,629
because there's a lot of people that
will think I'm not I'm not antagonistic

334

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
okay and then we want to understand what
 

341
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,990
okay and then we want to understand what
can we do with that stuff well I think

342
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
can we do with that stuff well I think
 

343
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,310
can we do with that stuff well I think
it's pretty cool that you could do

344
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,320
it's pretty cool that you could do
 

345
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,470
it's pretty cool that you could do
whatever you want with it versus I have

346

this and not that okay uh and in
particular we're going to focus in on

354
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,480
particular we're going to focus in on
 

355
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,829
particular we're going to focus in on
the shoulder okay the shoulder is key so

356
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
the shoulder okay the shoulder is key so
 

357
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,190
the shoulder okay the shoulder is key so
in terms of

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,550
in terms of
fighting uh because most of the personal

Weapons they're in my hands you're going
 

365
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,389
Weapons they're in my hands you're going
to find that the shoulder because it's a

366
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
to find that the shoulder because it's a
 

367
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,230
to find that the shoulder because it's a
ball and socket joint is a weak point in

368
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
ball and socket joint is a weak point in
 

369
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,389
ball and socket joint is a weak point in
how well you can deliver Force into your

00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
how well you can deliver Force into your
 

371
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,110
how well you can deliver Force into your

hands
 

373
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,829
hands
okay and you're also going to find

374
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:34,839
okay and you're also going to find
 

375
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,790
okay and you're also going to find
though that it's

376
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
though that it's
 

377
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,269
though that it's
psychologically it's a point that we

378
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279
psychologically it's a point that we
 

379
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,150
psychologically it's a point that we
once we realize that it's a marshall

380
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
once we realize that it's a marshall
 

381
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,069
once we realize that it's a marshall
weak point we we lock it in place do you

382
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:45,079
weak point we we lock it in place do you
 

383
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,550
weak point we we lock it in place do you
see and now you're doing all your iido

384
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
see and now you're doing all your iido
 

385
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,870
see and now you're doing all your iido
like this kind of stuff which makes whoa

386
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
like this kind of stuff which makes whoa
 

387
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,629
like this kind of stuff which makes whoa
that's going to feel way weird to you're

388
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
that's going to feel way weird to you're
 

389
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,670
that's going to feel way weird to you're
not going to be able to do okay so let

390
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
not going to be able to do okay so let
 

391
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,069
not going to be able to do okay so let
us go back

392
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
us go back
 

393
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,150
us go back
to uh

394
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
to uh
 

395
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,590
to uh
um the inward outward spiral and pay

396
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
um the inward outward spiral and pay
 

397
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,710
um the inward outward spiral and pay
attention you have you have to come

398
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720

 

399
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,949

closest okay so the inward outward

400
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
closest okay so the inward outward
 

401
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,310
closest okay so the inward outward
spiral drill again is this one Bo it

402
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
spiral drill again is this one Bo it
 

403
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,670
spiral drill again is this one Bo it
comes back

404
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
comes back
 

405
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,790
comes back
in boom okay you I I want all of you you

406
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
in boom okay you I I want all of you you
 

407
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,470
in boom okay you I I want all of you you
do that drill to learn the pattern first

408
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,480
do that drill to learn the pattern first
 

409
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,910
do that drill to learn the pattern first
you have to learn the gross pattern you

410
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:24,920
you have to learn the gross pattern you
 

411
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,069
you have to learn the gross pattern you
have to learn the gross pattern okay and

412
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
have to learn the gross pattern okay and
 

413
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,910
have to learn the gross pattern okay and
then you're going to go deep and deeper

414
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:30,920
then you're going to go deep and deeper
 

415
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,629
then you're going to go deep and deeper
to where you get to this spiritual

416
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
to where you get to this spiritual
 

417
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,790
to where you get to this spiritual
training where am I doing this

418
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
training where am I doing this
 

419
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,990
training where am I doing this
antagonistically am I doing it bracing

420
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,000
antagonistically am I doing it bracing
 

421
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,670
antagonistically am I doing it bracing
angle so you see you go like

422
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:42,680

 

423
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,990

this see and if you pay attention you're

424
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
this see and if you pay attention you're
 

425
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,670
this see and if you pay attention you're
like going to go I I know I'm using

426
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,680
like going to go I I know I'm using
 

427
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,990
like going to go I I know I'm using
them okay and I would

428
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
them okay and I would
 

429
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,470
them okay and I would
say that there's a lot of shoulder

430
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
say that there's a lot of shoulder
 

431
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,910
say that there's a lot of shoulder
injuries in iido for an art that is not

432
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:56,920
injuries in iido for an art that is not
 

433
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,949
injuries in iido for an art that is not
supposed to be using his shoulders okay

434
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
supposed to be using his shoulders okay
 

435
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,670
supposed to be using his shoulders okay
just it's like there's a lot of knee

436
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:00,680
just it's like there's a lot of knee
 

437
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,470
just it's like there's a lot of knee
injuries in the art that's supposed to

438
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
injuries in the art that's supposed to
 

439
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,430
injuries in the art that's supposed to
be doing

440
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
be doing
 

441
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,310
be doing
Chico uh why because we're antagonistic

442
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
Chico uh why because we're antagonistic
 

443
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,430
Chico uh why because we're antagonistic
even with our choreographed ukz

444
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
even with our choreographed ukz
 

445
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,910
even with our choreographed ukz
okay so when you do this drill you want

446
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:14,920
okay so when you do this drill you want
 

447
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,389
okay so when you do this drill you want
to again go to the physiology do you

448
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
to again go to the physiology do you
 

449
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,470
to again go to the physiology do you
feel like you're using your shoulder

450
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
feel like you're using your shoulder
 

451
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,310
feel like you're using your shoulder
okay do you feel like you need the

452
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
okay do you feel like you need the
 

453
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,310
okay do you feel like you need the
bracing angle all right and you're going

454
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,320
bracing angle all right and you're going
 

455
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,509
bracing angle all right and you're going
to have to get to that spiritual level

456
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
to have to get to that spiritual level
 

457
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,310
to have to get to that spiritual level
and I'm going to bring it back to the

458
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,320
and I'm going to bring it back to the
 

459
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,990
and I'm going to bring it back to the
shoulder which is not always uh

460
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
shoulder which is not always uh
 

461
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,350
shoulder which is not always uh
observable and I'm not sure it'll show

462
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:36,360
observable and I'm not sure it'll show
 

463
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,150
observable and I'm not sure it'll show
up here okay so when you do your spiral

464
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
up here okay so when you do your spiral
 

465
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,790
up here okay so when you do your spiral
your inward

466
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:41,800
your inward
 

467
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,670
your inward
spiral if you do it like this you're

468
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:44,680
spiral if you do it like this you're
 

469
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,870
spiral if you do it like this you're
going to you should feel it here that's

470
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
going to you should feel it here that's
 

471
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,990
going to you should feel it here that's
incorrect okay so you come around and

472
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
incorrect okay so you come around and
 

473
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,710
incorrect okay so you come around and
you're doing it you're doing bracing

474
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:53,720
you're doing it you're doing bracing
 

475
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,910
you're doing it you're doing bracing
angle okay and you're going to you

476
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
angle okay and you're going to you
 

477
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,069
angle okay and you're going to you
should as you get to the top you

478
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
should as you get to the top you
 

479
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,389
should as you get to the top you
actually feel that outer deltoid

480
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
actually feel that outer deltoid
 

481
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,389
actually feel that outer deltoid
Activation so what you have to do to do

482
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:03,399
Activation so what you have to do to do
 

483
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,189
Activation so what you have to do to do
the EM spiral is you're going to take

484
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
the EM spiral is you're going to take
 

485
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,030
the EM spiral is you're going to take
the

486
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
the
 

487
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,829
the
locked the lockness or the locked

488
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
locked the lockness or the locked
 

489
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,350
locked the lockness or the locked
shoulder that you're using and you have

490
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360
shoulder that you're using and you have
 

491
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,590
shoulder that you're using and you have
to drop it okay and you're going to see

492
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600

different whoa
that is a lot of inner deltoid he let's

712
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:33,640
that is a lot of inner deltoid he let's
 

713
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,990
that is a lot of inner deltoid he let's
go through just keep

714
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000

 

715
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,390

going and again we're not seeing it on

716
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
going and again we're not seeing it on
 

717
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,990
going and again we're not seeing it on
the

718

719
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,430

outside whoa you we just moving our arm

720
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
outside whoa you we just moving our arm
 

721
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,870
outside whoa you we just moving our arm
in

722

in
 

723
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,390
in
space all right let's get some detail

724
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,400
space all right let's get some detail
 

725
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,710
space all right let's get some detail
so think about Marley when it should

726
00:22:59,710 --> 00:22:59,720
so think about Marley when it should
 

727
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,590
so think about Marley when it should
happen so I gave you two two uh

728
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:03,600
happen so I gave you two two uh
 

729
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,590
happen so I gave you two two uh
catalysts to to measure by so for

730
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:06,600
catalysts to to measure by so for
 

731
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,029
catalysts to to measure by so for
example um it's got to be where when I

732
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:10,039
example um it's got to be where when I
 

733
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,390
example um it's got to be where when I
release it he can come in so if I

734
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
release it he can come in so if I
 

735
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,510
release it he can come in so if I
release it he came in a little but he's

736
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
release it he came in a little but he's
 

737
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,909
release it he came in a little but he's
not going into the P you got it so the

738
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
not going into the P you got it so the
 

739
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,830
not going into the P you got it so the
shoulder I'm going to keep it here and

740
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:22,840
shoulder I'm going to keep it here and
 

741
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,870
shoulder I'm going to keep it here and
it's actually when you would feel that

742
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
it's actually when you would feel that
 

743
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,750
it's actually when you would feel that
ah that delto is out that's where I

744
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:28,760
ah that delto is out that's where I
 

745
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,750
ah that delto is out that's where I
released it

746
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:30,760
released it
 

747
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,669
released it
okay so you just like all things

748
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
okay so you just like all things
 

749
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,149
okay so you just like all things
complete the Yang cycle of action and

750
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
complete the Yang cycle of action and
 

751
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,310
complete the Yang cycle of action and
right when you feel that n that's going

752
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
right when you feel that n that's going
 

753
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,149
right when you feel that n that's going
to Yong Yong Clash that's when you

754
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
to Yong Yong Clash that's when you
 

755
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,110
to Yong Yong Clash that's when you
release it okay and when you release it

756
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
release it okay and when you release it
 

757
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,789
release it okay and when you release it
that's the turn happens on its own so

758
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:47,799
that's the turn happens on its own so
 

759
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,390
that's the turn happens on its own so
don't don't do it like

760
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
don't don't do it like
 

761

however you want to describe it and
 

787
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,950
however you want to describe it and
that's where the rest of the Spiral

788
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
that's where the rest of the Spiral
 

789
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,990
that's where the rest of the Spiral
happens okay

790
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,000

 

791
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,470

on the out the outer

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,480
on the out the outer
 

793
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,549
on the out the outer
one he comes around okay he he might

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
one he comes around okay he he might
 

795
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,190
one he comes around okay he he might
Sometimes some ukas get here like

796
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
Sometimes some ukas get here like
 

797
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,029
Sometimes some ukas get here like
they're on the adhesion and it's easier

798
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
they're on the adhesion and it's easier
 

799
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,269
they're on the adhesion and it's easier
to feel

800
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
to feel
 

801
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,870
to feel
um but as you come around here boom you

don't want to start pushing here okay
 

805
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,310
don't want to start pushing here okay
here is where the the extra

806
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,320
here is where the the extra
 

807
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,950
here is where the the extra
drop does that part and then cool he's

808
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
drop does that part and then cool he's
 

809
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,149
drop does that part and then cool he's
there

810
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:05,159

 

811
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,510

okay what mostly happens is we just make

812
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,520
okay what mostly happens is we just make
 

813
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,630
okay what mostly happens is we just make
a big circle with our arm and come

814
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:11,640
a big circle with our arm and come
 

815
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,430
a big circle with our arm and come
around but you should feel it again in

816
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:14,440
around but you should feel it again in
 

817
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,350
around but you should feel it again in
that outer deltoid so let's look at the

818
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
that outer deltoid so let's look at the
 

819
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,510
that outer deltoid so let's look at the
big

820
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:18,520
big
 

821
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,230
big
circle big circle look how my shoulders

822
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,240
circle big circle look how my shoulders
 

823
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,310
circle big circle look how my shoulders
stay still do you

824
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320

 

825
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,190

see and watch how wide the hand and is

826
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,200
see and watch how wide the hand and is
 

827
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,870
see and watch how wide the hand and is
to the outer

828
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
to the outer
 

829
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,070
to the outer
rim okay now watch my elbow in the big

830
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,080
rim okay now watch my elbow in the big
 

831
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,350
rim okay now watch my elbow in the big
circle big

832
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360

 

833
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,669

circle it is making a circle at the same

834
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:46,679
circle it is making a circle at the same
 

835
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,389
circle it is making a circle at the same
time that my hand is that my shoulder is

836
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:49,399
time that my hand is that my shoulder is
 

837
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,830
time that my hand is that my shoulder is
cuz I'm just doing this do you see that

838
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
cuz I'm just doing this do you see that
 

839
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,870
cuz I'm just doing this do you see that
all right on the other

840
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:53,880
all right on the other
 

841
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,389
all right on the other
one it's

842
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:56,399
one it's
 

843
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,470
one it's
not you see

844
00:25:59,470 --> 00:25:59,480
not you see
 

845
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,110
not you see
they're they're kind of snaking so if we

846
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
they're they're kind of snaking so if we
 

847
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,070
they're they're kind of snaking so if we
can NOP here big circle one big lever

848
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
can NOP here big circle one big lever
 

849
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,190
can NOP here big circle one big lever
like a stick in this one do you see the

850
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
like a stick in this one do you see the
 

851
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,110
like a stick in this one do you see the
shoulder has circled the hand has not

852
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,120
shoulder has circled the hand has not
 

853
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,110
shoulder has circled the hand has not
shoulder elbow hand okay not not a big

854
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
shoulder elbow hand okay not not a big
 

855
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,029
shoulder elbow hand okay not not a big
thing like that okay so again he's

856
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:22,039
thing like that okay so again he's
 

857
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,029
thing like that okay so again he's
pushing hard pushing hard pushing hard

858
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:24,039
pushing hard pushing hard pushing hard
 

859
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,110
pushing hard pushing hard pushing hard
your hardest your absolute

860
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,120
your hardest your absolute
 

861
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:57,230
your hardest your absolute
hardest your absolute hardest

862
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,240

 

863
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:08,389

sh

864
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:08,399

 

865
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,990

okay so I don't want to have on the

866
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,000
okay so I don't want to have on the
 

867
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,950
okay so I don't want to have on the
outer one one big stick with my elbow

868
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:13,960
outer one one big stick with my elbow
 

869
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,990
outer one one big stick with my elbow
shoulder and hand and the same uh radius

870
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,000
shoulder and hand and the same uh radius
 

871
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,990
shoulder and hand and the same uh radius
there that's shoulder elbow hand okay

872
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
there that's shoulder elbow hand okay
 

873
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,669
there that's shoulder elbow hand okay
wom and then what do you think it's the

874
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:24,679
wom and then what do you think it's the
 

875
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,510
wom and then what do you think it's the
other way too shoulder elbow Head okay

876
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:28,520
other way too shoulder elbow Head okay
 

877
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,950
other way too shoulder elbow Head okay
on this one

878
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
on this one
 

879
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,110
on this one
shoulder this is where you would get the

880
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
shoulder this is where you would get the
 

881
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,590
shoulder this is where you would get the
adhesion You' bring them forward there

882
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
adhesion You' bring them forward there
 

883
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,789
adhesion You' bring them forward there
right into the elbow and then this comes

884
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:37,799
right into the elbow and then this comes
 

885
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,389
right into the elbow and then this comes
up and out on the Emi right it's when

886
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:41,399
up and out on the Emi right it's when
 

887
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:44,470
up and out on the Emi right it's when
you go shoulder elbow that's when he

888
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
you go shoulder elbow that's when he
 

889
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,230
you go shoulder elbow that's when he
comes in there and then on this grip

890
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,240
comes in there and then on this grip
 

891
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,190
comes in there and then on this grip
that's where the coou projection is on

892
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
that's where the coou projection is on
 

893
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
that's where the coou projection is on
that grip okay all right let's let's see

894
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
that grip okay all right let's let's see
 

895
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,430
that grip okay all right let's let's see
if we can not

896
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:54,440
if we can not
 

897
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,430
if we can not
have this these stick circles do you see

898
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
have this these stick circles do you see
 

899
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,389
have this these stick circles do you see
there this

900
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:03,399

 

901
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,389

circle okay even if it's gross like I'm

902
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
circle okay even if it's gross like I'm
 

903
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,029
circle okay even if it's gross like I'm
doing now you see I'm showing I'm trying

904
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:09,039
doing now you see I'm showing I'm trying
 

905
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,470
doing now you see I'm showing I'm trying
to show it to you guys do you think you

906
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:11,480
to show it to you guys do you think you
 

907
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,789
to show it to you guys do you think you
need to show it you don't need to show

908
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:13,799
need to show it you don't need to show
 

909
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,389
need to show it you don't need to show
it okay you don't you don't in fact as

910
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
it okay you don't you don't in fact as
 

911
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,630
it okay you don't you don't in fact as
your skill goes higher the movement is

912
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
your skill goes higher the movement is
 

913
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,789
your skill goes higher the movement is
smaller and shorter and therefore there

914
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:21,799
smaller and shorter and therefore there
 

915
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,230
smaller and shorter and therefore there
shouldn't be this big body movement it's

916
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
shouldn't be this big body movement it's
 

917
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,470
shouldn't be this big body movement it's
just inside of you that you're doing it

918
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
just inside of you that you're doing it
 

919
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,909
just inside of you that you're doing it
okay so we have some gross movements

920
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:28,919
okay so we have some gross movements
 

921
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,830
okay so we have some gross movements
here to work with okay here we

922
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840

 

923
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,029

go so you have that stick you're moving

924
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
go so you have that stick you're moving
 

925
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,149
go so you have that stick you're moving
on the outward spiral and then you just

926
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
on the outward spiral and then you just
 

927
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,590
on the outward spiral and then you just
have bracing angle on the inward even

928
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:42,600
have bracing angle on the inward even
 

929
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,710
have bracing angle on the inward even
your left leg move backwards as it got

930
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,720
your left leg move backwards as it got
 

931
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,870
your left leg move backwards as it got
displaced

932
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880

 

933
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,870

okay yeah see you feel like I'm not

934
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:53,880
okay yeah see you feel like I'm not
 

935
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,070
okay yeah see you feel like I'm not
going to unlock that shoulder okay but

936
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
going to unlock that shoulder okay but
 

937
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:09,669
going to unlock that shoulder okay but
that's what we're working on hey

938
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679

 

939
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,430

in in my

940
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
in in my
 

941
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,110
in in my
teachings the dichotomous mind is the

942
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,120
teachings the dichotomous mind is the
 

943
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,669
teachings the dichotomous mind is the
ego tripartite mind

944
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:16,679
ego tripartite mind
 

945
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,269
ego tripartite mind
so and I have simplified it to it's just

946
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
so and I have simplified it to it's just
 

947
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,430
so and I have simplified it to it's just
uh it's Yi it's Earth aspect it is uh

948
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
uh it's Yi it's Earth aspect it is uh
 

949
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,590
uh it's Yi it's Earth aspect it is uh
fear it is demonic it's half of the

950
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:32,600
fear it is demonic it's half of the
 

951
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,470
fear it is demonic it's half of the
universe

952
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
universe
 

953
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,710
universe
okay

954
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
okay
 

955
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,070
okay
um and so it would include of course

956
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
um and so it would include of course
 

957
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,669
um and so it would include of course
things like ah myuk ah I'm going to fail

958
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:44,679
things like ah myuk ah I'm going to fail
 

959
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,269
things like ah myuk ah I'm going to fail
in my technique but it would also

960
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
in my technique but it would also
 

961
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,990
in my technique but it would also
include the desire to do the technique

962
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
include the desire to do the technique
 

963
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,870
include the desire to do the technique
okay and I'm still seeing that on the

964
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
okay and I'm still seeing that on the
 

965
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,389
okay and I'm still seeing that on the
outward spiral so when you

966
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
outward spiral so when you
 

967
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,190
outward spiral so when you
now throw like like that do you see do

968
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,200
now throw like like that do you see do
 

969
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,950
now throw like like that do you see do
you get it you again are going to

970
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:01,960
you get it you again are going to
 

971
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,470
you get it you again are going to
martially you're going to go back to

972
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:03,480
martially you're going to go back to
 

973
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,190
martially you're going to go back to
that outer deltoid so what I would like

974
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,200
that outer deltoid so what I would like
 

975
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,789
that outer deltoid so what I would like
for you to do is have have your hand

976
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:09,799

up and uh just drop it without feeling
 

979
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,950
up and uh just drop it without feeling
that outer deltoid okay like at the 90

980
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:17,960
that outer deltoid okay like at the 90
 

981
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,070
that outer deltoid okay like at the 90
can you all do that so here and you're

982
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
can you all do that so here and you're
 

983
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,070
can you all do that so here and you're
trying to like okay just I don't want to

984
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
trying to like okay just I don't want to
 

985
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,590
trying to like okay just I don't want to
activate that shoulder okay it kind of

986
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
activate that shoulder okay it kind of
 

987
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,509
activate that shoulder okay it kind of
works okay and now see how far you can

there do you get it cuz what I want is

1090
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,200
there do you get it cuz what I want is
 

1091
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,909
there do you get it cuz what I want is
to keep that

1092
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:12,919

sensation of the mind dropping the chi

1094
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000

1095
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,269

dropping do do you understand that I

1096
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:18,279
dropping do do you understand that I

don't really care what he does I care

1098
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,360
don't really care what he does I care
 

1099
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,269
don't really care what he does I care
how I'm doing it okay and so the reason

1100
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
how I'm doing it okay and so the reason
 

1101
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,350
how I'm doing it okay and so the reason
why I ask him to push his hardest is

1102
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,360
why I ask him to push his hardest is
 

1103
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,430
why I ask him to push his hardest is
it's more likely to

1104
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:30,440
it's more likely to
 

1105
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,950
it's more likely to
trigger everything I don't want trigger

1106
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:32,960
trigger everything I don't want trigger
 

1107
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,389
trigger everything I don't want trigger
so it's a higher training environment

1108
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:35,399
so it's a higher training environment
 

1109
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,950
so it's a higher training environment
okay so he'll push his absolute hardest

1110
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:37,960
okay so he'll push his absolute hardest
 

1111
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,269
okay so he'll push his absolute hardest
and I'll do the drill with and I don't

1112
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:40,279
and I'll do the drill with and I don't
 

1113
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,509
and I'll do the drill with and I don't
really pay

1114
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
really pay
 

1115
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,029
really pay
attention so if you look if you look at

1333
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,470
me then I'm not pushable it's and the
way that I describe this is the energy

1334
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
way that I describe this is the energy
 

1335
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,150
way that I describe this is the energy
is being internalized the energy is

1336
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,160
is being internalized the energy is
 

1337
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,950
is being internalized the energy is
being internalized it's coming into me

1338
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
being internalized it's coming into me
 

1339
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,950
being internalized it's coming into me
um and likewise if I go so let me I only

1340
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:01,960
um and likewise if I go so let me I only

1343
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,829
he can feel it but I want you to feel it
okay so that's one relationship and then

1344
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
okay so that's one relationship and then
 

1345
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,430
okay so that's one relationship and then
here is what I'm draw you see even the

1346
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:08,440
here is what I'm draw you see even the
 

1347
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,910
here is what I'm draw you see even the
skin starts to move there is movement

1348
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:10,920
skin starts to move there is movement
 

1349
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,069
skin starts to move there is movement
but people can't can't sense it okay but

1350
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
but people can't can't sense it okay but
 

1351
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,190
but people can't can't sense it okay but
that is where the chi dropped the Mind

1352
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,200
that is where the chi dropped the Mind
 

1353
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,150
that is where the chi dropped the Mind
dropped okay and the more I talk it's

1354
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,160
dropped okay and the more I talk it's
 

1355
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,950
dropped okay and the more I talk it's
difficult because language is ego Tri

1356
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:20,960
difficult because language is ego Tri
 

1357
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,510
difficult because language is ego Tri
partite mind and so if you're sensitive

1358
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
partite mind and so if you're sensitive
 

1359
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,630
partite mind and so if you're sensitive
enough it's back off right now as I'm

1360
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:25,640
enough it's back off right now as I'm
 

1361
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,190
enough it's back off right now as I'm
talking do you see uh and I'll drop it

1362
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,200
talking do you see uh and I'll drop it
 

1363
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,470
talking do you see uh and I'll drop it
again there we're dropped again okay um

1364
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
again there we're dropped again okay um
 

1365
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,470
again there we're dropped again okay um
if he pulls on me it doesn't it's not

going to change anything nothing's going
 

1369
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,109
going to change anything nothing's going
to change okay so he's pulling now which

1370
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
to change okay so he's pulling now which
 

1371
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,630
to change okay so he's pulling now which
is the opposite of

1372
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:43,640
is the opposite of
 

1373
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,470
is the opposite of
him maybe I'm getting out of the way do

1377
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,589
you see but he's he's trying to pull and
he'll feel the ground too okay and I'll

1378
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:52,599
he'll feel the ground too okay and I'll
 

1379
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,109
he'll feel the ground too okay and I'll
do the same he's pulling the same way it

1380
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:55,119
do the same he's pulling the same way it
 

1381
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,990
do the same he's pulling the same way it
doesn't matter and he's going to pull

doesn't matter and he's going to pull
 

1383
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,270

does

1388
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920

 

1389
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,430

do you guys see that so what that

1390
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,440
do you guys see that so what that
 

1391
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,270
do you guys see that so what that
telling you is

telling you is
 

1393
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,950
telling you is
that CQ and II at the higher state is

1394
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
that CQ and II at the higher state is
 

1395
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,270
that CQ and II at the higher state is
indistinguishable and you can you you

1396
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:48,280
indistinguishable and you can you you
 

1397
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,870
indistinguishable and you can you you
are going to uh explain that several

1398
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:51,880
are going to uh explain that several
 

1399
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,349
are going to uh explain that several
ways so one way is saying they're

1400
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:54,359
ways so one way is saying they're
 

1401
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,630
ways so one way is saying they're
simultaneously there or they they have

the only reason I have to match external
 

1415
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,470
the only reason I have to match external
yin to yangong is because I can't

higher a less tolerant environment
 

1471
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,990
higher a less tolerant environment
meaning it's going to trigger

okay uh what is the difference is the
mind the mind is dropping

1628
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:18,760
mind the mind is dropping
 

1629
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,710
mind the mind is dropping
okay it's drops from releasing it and

1630
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
okay it's drops from releasing it and
 

1631
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,510
okay it's drops from releasing it and
right so the skill is releasing as I

1632
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
right so the skill is releasing as I
 

1633
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,030
right so the skill is releasing as I
release I learn what that is you can

1634
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
release I learn what that is you can
 

1635
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,750
release I learn what that is you can
Define it that way what does releasing

1636
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:30,760
Define it that way what does releasing
 

1637
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,470
Define it that way what does releasing
mean uh releasing is when the Mind drops

1638
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,480
mean uh releasing is when the Mind drops
 

1639
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,510
mean uh releasing is when the Mind drops
releasing is when the Yang aspect is

1640
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:37,520
releasing is when the Yang aspect is
 

1641
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,630
releasing is when the Yang aspect is
internalized okay um you can also

1642
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
internalized okay um you can also
 

1643
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,430
internalized okay um you can also
say that um that's where I become

1644
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
say that um that's where I become
 

1645
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,470
say that um that's where I become
permeable so he can push from here you

1646
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
permeable so he can push from here you
 

1647
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,230
permeable so he can push from here you
can push from here push and pull are no

1648
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:53,240
can push from here push and pull are no
 

1649
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,230
can push from here push and pull are no
longer are no longer relevant Etc okay

1650
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,240

 

1651
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,950

in O sense's tradition of aoto that

1652
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:05,960

 

1653
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,750

permeability

1654
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:08,760
permeability
 

1655
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,109
permeability
is wherein they would practice their

1656
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:12,119
is wherein they would practice their
 

1657
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,589
is wherein they would practice their
possession rights okay so and this is a

1658
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:16,599
possession rights okay so and this is a
 

1659
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:19,750

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,630
and then the natural process of the mind
dropping or the ego tripartite mind

1792
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
dropping or the ego tripartite mind
 

1793
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,630
dropping or the ego tripartite mind
ceasing in its

1794
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
ceasing in its
 

1795
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,109
ceasing in its
dominance when or when the lower tomen

1796
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:40,119
dominance when or when the lower tomen
 

1797
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,789
dominance when or when the lower tomen
forms that's a natural process that just

1798
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799
forms that's a natural process that just
 

1799
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,390
forms that's a natural process that just
happens once you release

1800
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:45,400
happens once you release
 

1801
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,630
happens once you release
okay the hand movements are manipulation

1802
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:49,640
okay the hand movements are manipulation
 

1803
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,710
okay the hand movements are manipulation
of that process

1804
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
of that process
 

1805
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,589
of that process
okay it's just so human right we're like

1806
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
okay it's just so human right we're like
 

1807
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,349
okay it's just so human right we're like
okay that's the natural ersing but I

1808
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
okay that's the natural ersing but I
 

1809
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,109
okay that's the natural ersing but I
think I can't improve it I think I can

1810
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
think I can't improve it I think I can
 

1811
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,069
think I can't improve it I think I can
get it better um I don't think you can

1812
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
get it better um I don't think you can
 

1813
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,470
get it better um I don't think you can
but that is what you're doing okay so

1814
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:07,480
but that is what you're doing okay so
 

1815
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,630
but that is what you're doing okay so
your patterns are uh all

1816
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:11,640
your patterns are uh all
 

1817
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,789
your patterns are uh all
about accentuating that dropping but

1818
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:15,799
about accentuating that dropping but
 

1819
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,990
about accentuating that dropping but
only if I'm training in this

1820
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
only if I'm training in this
 

1821
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,870
only if I'm training in this
way if I'm not training this way you

1822
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:21,880
way if I'm not training this way you
 

1823
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,150
way if I'm not training this way you
will not only see that the mind is up

1824
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:25,160
will not only see that the mind is up
 

1825
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,829
will not only see that the mind is up
high but you will see the arm patterns

1826
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:28,839
high but you will see the arm patterns
 

1827
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:30,349
high but you will see the arm patterns
change

1828
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:30,359
change
 

1829
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,549
change
because they're not following what the

1830
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:33,559
because they're not following what the
 

1831
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:34,990
because they're not following what the
mind is

1832
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,000
mind is
 

1833
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,069
mind is
dropping in a way to accentuate the mind

1834
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
dropping in a way to accentuate the mind
 

1835
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,670
dropping in a way to accentuate the mind
dropping okay so for

1836
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:40,680
dropping okay so for
 

1837
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,829
dropping okay so for
example uh we'll just go back to the

1838
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:42,839
example uh we'll just go back to the
 

1839
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:45,230
example uh we'll just go back to the
spinal

1840
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,240
spinal
 

1841
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,270
spinal
displacement I go and then you go and

1842
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280
displacement I go and then you go and
 

1843
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,470
displacement I go and then you go and
then I'm going to

1844
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
then I'm going to
 

1845
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,510
then I'm going to
throw and my hand is up you see that is

1846
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
throw and my hand is up you see that is
 

1847
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,789
throw and my hand is up you see that is
not the p pattern the pattern to

1848
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:57,799
not the p pattern the pattern to
 

1849
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:01,870
not the p pattern the pattern to
complete is down here and that

1850
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:01,880
complete is down here and that
 

1851
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,710
complete is down here and that
dness is the mind dropping at the end

1852
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:05,720
dness is the mind dropping at the end
 

1853
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,349
dness is the mind dropping at the end
okay which is why in aido you have your

1854
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
okay which is why in aido you have your
 

1855
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,910
okay which is why in aido you have your
pins and it's down here the Mind drops

1856
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:12,920
pins and it's down here the Mind drops
 

1857
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,029
pins and it's down here the Mind drops
stays dropped at the end

1858
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:16,039
stays dropped at the end
 

1859
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:21,150
stays dropped at the end
okay so I stay in that mind State and I

1860
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:21,160
okay so I stay in that mind State and I
 

1861
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,870
okay so I stay in that mind State and I
am moving with my

1862
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
am moving with my
 

1863
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,230
am moving with my
hands this this Chi this alchemically

1864
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,240
hands this this Chi this alchemically
 

1865
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,589
hands this this Chi this alchemically
treated Yang chi in my body inside my

1866
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
treated Yang chi in my body inside my
 

1867
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:38,789
treated Yang chi in my body inside my
lower ton den and I'm moving

1868
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799

 

1869
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,230

that so if you pay attention

1870
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
that so if you pay attention
 

1871
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,750
that so if you pay attention
now alchemically yongi comes in and it

1872
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:46,760
now alchemically yongi comes in and it
 

1873
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,470
now alchemically yongi comes in and it
goes down hits the Earth y Yin is

1874
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,480
goes down hits the Earth y Yin is
 

1875
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,270
goes down hits the Earth y Yin is
generated and I start spinning them okay

1876
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:54,280
generated and I start spinning them okay
 

1877
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,589
generated and I start spinning them okay
because to return to the pre-

1878
00:58:56,589 --> 00:58:56,599
because to return to the pre-
 

1879
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,069
because to return to the pre-
dichotomous State the only way you do it

1880
00:58:59,069 --> 00:58:59,079
dichotomous State the only way you do it
 

1881
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:01,990
dichotomous State the only way you do it
is spiral rotating so if you watch my

1882
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,000
is spiral rotating so if you watch my
 

1883
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,710
is spiral rotating so if you watch my
hands you can see I'm bringing it in you

00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:26,760
underneath pom and then I now
 

1897
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,230
underneath pom and then I now
end the ritual with the drop the final
