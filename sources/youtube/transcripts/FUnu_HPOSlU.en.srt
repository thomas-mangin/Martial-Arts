doing

160
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040

 

161
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,589

this this this way for I

162
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599

 

163
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,110

again it's

164
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,120

float I think the Niko I can put the
 

259
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,720
