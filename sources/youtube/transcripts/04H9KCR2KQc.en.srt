that would do that and that's what i'd

64
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
that would do that and that's what i'd
 

65
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,190
that would do that and that's what i'd
end up

66
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200

80
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680

 

81
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,830

it's

82
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
it's
 

83
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,230
it's
easier if it comes out before i've got

84
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
easier if it comes out before i've got
 

85
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,230
easier if it comes out before i've got
my hands closed

86
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
my hands closed
 

87
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,910
my hands closed
then it's not kion

88
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
then it's not kion
 

89
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,630
then it's not kion
and he can take his hand away

so

92
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
so
 

93
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,710
so
we've got another technique for that so
