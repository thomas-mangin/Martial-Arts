1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,590

I'll going give you a bit more

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600

 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,909

detail you have to do an expression with

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:06,919
detail you have to do an expression with
 

5
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,910
detail you have to do an expression with
the hand so my hand is at right angles

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
the hand so my hand is at right angles
 

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,789
the hand so my hand is at right angles
really right if it's not at right angles

8
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
really right if it's not at right angles
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,030
really right if it's not at right angles
and it's sort of like halfway there I've

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
and it's sort of like halfway there I've
 

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,429
and it's sort of like halfway there I've
started closing up this Gap

12
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:17,439
started closing up this Gap
 

13
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,269
started closing up this Gap
here

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
here
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,590
here
so what happens is his wrist doesn't

16
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:22,600
so what happens is his wrist doesn't
 

17
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,750
so what happens is his wrist doesn't
turn all the way over it stays at a if I

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
turn all the way over it stays at a if I
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,589
turn all the way over it stays at a if I
had a Joe it would be like at that

20
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:28,599
had a Joe it would be like at that
 

21
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,790
had a Joe it would be like at that
angle I need need

22
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
angle I need need
 

23
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,910
angle I need need
it parallel is it parallel flat I need

24
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:34,920
it parallel is it parallel flat I need
 

25
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,350
it parallel is it parallel flat I need
it this way so the thumb can go in there

26
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
it this way so the thumb can go in there
 

27
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,470
it this way so the thumb can go in there
now now it might seem a small thing but

28
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,480
now now it might seem a small thing but
 

29
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,270
now now it might seem a small thing but
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb

30
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,280
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb
 

31
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,830
if I only turn it a little bit my thumb
gets a a

32
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
gets a a
 

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,069
gets a a
grip but it never gets the flat the the

34
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
grip but it never gets the flat the the
 

35
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,349
grip but it never gets the flat the the
flat can't of the thumb can't get on

36
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:54,359

 

37
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,270

it I get a bit there but the thumb now

38
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,280
it I get a bit there but the thumb now
 

39
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,470
it I get a bit there but the thumb now
has to bend to get there

40
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
has to bend to get there
 

41
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,509
has to bend to get there
if I turn it I just put the thumb in and

42
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:02,519
if I turn it I just put the thumb in and
 

43
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:04,630
if I turn it I just put the thumb in and
it fits can you all see

44
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
it fits can you all see
 

45
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,350
it fits can you all see
that

46
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,360
that
 

47
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,950
that
okay that's what makes it

48
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960

 

49
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,109

strong so you've got to crank it

50
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
strong so you've got to crank it
 

51
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,870
strong so you've got to crank it
around You' got to crank that round

52
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:17,880
around You' got to crank that round
 

53
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,550
around You' got to crank that round
until that thumb has got that

54
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:21,560
until that thumb has got that
 

55
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,550
until that thumb has got that
firmly cuz what we're going to do is

56
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,560
firmly cuz what we're going to do is
 

57
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,230

we're not going to just do she and Aggy

58
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
we're not going to just do she and Aggy
 

59
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,910
we're not going to just do she and Aggy
and this thumb is going to be really

60
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
and this thumb is going to be really
 

61
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,069
and this thumb is going to be really
important to where where it's

62
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079

 

63
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,670

placed when we get doing higher forms

64
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
placed when we get doing higher forms
 

65
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,910
placed when we get doing higher forms
like yokam manucci and that you're going

66
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
like yokam manucci and that you're going
 

67
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,109
like yokam manucci and that you're going
to be finding it's really difficult to

68
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:40,119
to be finding it's really difficult to
 

69
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,870
to be finding it's really difficult to
get that Thumb in in

70
