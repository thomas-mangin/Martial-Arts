00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
is that i am trying to minimize how much
 

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,310
is that i am trying to minimize how much
energy i need to input in order to

54
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
energy i need to input in order to
 

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,230
energy i need to input in order to
achieve the desired force

right just go slow you see i make the

78
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
right just go slow you see i make the
 

79
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,910

so what i'm going to do now
 

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,350
so what i'm going to do now
see how i go around that energy you see

84
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
see how i go around that energy you see
 

85
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,430
see how i go around that energy you see
that so right here is my strength

86

so you start to go but i go like this

92
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
so you start to go but i go like this
 

93
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,270
so you start to go but i go like this
you see and then you're going to do what

94
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
you see and then you're going to do what
 

95
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,869
you see and then you're going to do what
what do you want to do so you're going

96
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
what do you want to do so you're going
 

97
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,350
what do you want to do so you're going
