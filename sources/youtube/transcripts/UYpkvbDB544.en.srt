00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:12,990

my basic explanation of what I generally

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,000
my basic explanation of what I generally
 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,480
my basic explanation of what I generally
call IT I think there are several

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,490
call IT I think there are several
 

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,990
call IT I think there are several
components to IT but the vast majority

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,000
components to IT but the vast majority
 

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,300
components to IT but the vast majority
of what I would call a key it could be

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,310
of what I would call a key it could be
 

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,370
of what I would call a key it could be
summed up with rhythm and timing so I'm

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,380
summed up with rhythm and timing so I'm
 

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,640
summed up with rhythm and timing so I'm
going to use a non Aikido analogy here

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:26,650
going to use a non Aikido analogy here
 

13
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,990
going to use a non Aikido analogy here
and something we're all very familiar

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
and something we're all very familiar
 

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,810
and something we're all very familiar
with in school when someone goes to sit

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:30,820
with in school when someone goes to sit
 

17
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,760
with in school when someone goes to sit
down in the chair and as they sit you

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:32,770

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,030
pulled the chair out from under them
 

21
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,180
pulled the chair out from under them
like you essentially throw them right

22
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,190
like you essentially throw them right
 

23
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,860
like you essentially throw them right
you're throwing them this is something

24
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:37,870
you're throwing them this is something
 

25
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,120
you're throwing them this is something
we're all familiar with there's nothing

26
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,130
we're all familiar with there's nothing
 

27
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,500

31
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,760
seen it in school in order for me to do
this though I have to create an IT

32
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:44,770
this though I have to create an IT
 

33
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,270

so as Mike stands in front of chair he's

36
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,480
so as Mike stands in front of chair he's
 

37
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,460
so as Mike stands in front of chair he's
basically gonna go through a procedure

38
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,470
basically gonna go through a procedure
 

39
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,410
basically gonna go through a procedure
he's gonna look to see if there's a

40
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,420
he's gonna look to see if there's a
 

41
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,420
he's gonna look to see if there's a
chair there and then once he's confident

42
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:54,430
chair there and then once he's confident
 

43
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,530
chair there and then once he's confident
that there's a chair there he's gonna

44
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:55,540
that there's a chair there he's gonna
 

45
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,870
that there's a chair there he's gonna
begin the rhythm of sitting okay this is

46
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:57,880
begin the rhythm of sitting okay this is
 

47
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,569
begin the rhythm of sitting okay this is
his sitting rhythm okay my job is the

48
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:00,579
his sitting rhythm okay my job is the
 

49
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:02,400
his sitting rhythm okay my job is the
one who wants to make a 90 interaction

50
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,410
one who wants to make a 90 interaction
 

51

on and I really won't get the rhythm see

96
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,380
on and I really won't get the rhythm see
 

97
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,109

Mike's following the chair right I can't
 

99
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,309
Mike's following the chair right I can't
get it out from under because Mike is

100
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:50,319
get it out from under because Mike is
 

101
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,709
get it out from under because Mike is
paying attention to the chair so what I
