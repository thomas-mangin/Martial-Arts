the back foot what was the front foot
 

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,550
the back foot what was the front foot
can stay there

54
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560

 

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,190

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
from here if i leave it
 

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,109
from here if i leave it
here close what i call closed

00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119

 

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,550

at the end of this

60
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560

 

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,750

it will twist

62
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760

 

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,589

and since i was aged in my early 30s

00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
and since i was aged in my early 30s
 

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,869
and since i was aged in my early 30s
i've had osteoarthritis in the knees

66
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
i've had osteoarthritis in the knees
 

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,670
i've had osteoarthritis in the knees
and i've found that it applies pressure

68
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
and i've found that it applies pressure
 

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,589
and i've found that it applies pressure
on the knees well that can't be good for

70
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
on the knees well that can't be good for
 

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,350
on the knees well that can't be good for
your well-being can it

72
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
your well-being can it
 

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,470
your well-being can it
so by having a a weakness in my knees at

74
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
so by having a a weakness in my knees at
 

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,229
so by having a a weakness in my knees at
an early age

76
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
an early age
 

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,070
an early age
it's it pointed out to me that um

78
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
it's it pointed out to me that um
 

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,390
it's it pointed out to me that um
doing it my way it doesn't destroy my

80
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
doing it my way it doesn't destroy my
 

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,390
doing it my way it doesn't destroy my
knees so my knees have kept pretty much

82
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
knees so my knees have kept pretty much
 

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,270
knees so my knees have kept pretty much
intact

84
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
intact
 

85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:55,830
intact
the last 40 years

86
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,550

if it wants to slide it can slide it can

88
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
if it wants to slide it can slide it can
 

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,270
if it wants to slide it can slide it can
move

90
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
move
 

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,670
move
but you don't want that twist because

92
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
but you don't want that twist because
 

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,670
but you don't want that twist because
the twist is coming from the upper body

94
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
the twist is coming from the upper body
 

95
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,990
the twist is coming from the upper body
going

96
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
going
 

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,470
going
all the way through the leg and twisting

98
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
all the way through the leg and twisting
 

99
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,670
all the way through the leg and twisting
the knee

100
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
the knee
 

101
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,070
the knee
and that foot and you're losing power

102
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
and that foot and you're losing power
 

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,710
and that foot and you're losing power
then

104
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
then
 

105
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,750
then
if the foot that then

106
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
if the foot that then
 

107
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,229
if the foot that then
and this this this powerful strike from

108
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
and this this this powerful strike from
 

109
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,710
and this this this powerful strike from
the hips

110
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
the hips
 

111
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:30,830
the hips
is being lost through that through that

112
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

113
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:44,830

twist

114
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

115
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,110

so

116
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120

 

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,630

takes a lot of power it's going to take

118
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
takes a lot of power it's going to take
 

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,470
takes a lot of power it's going to take
a lot of power to break somebody's knee

120
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
a lot of power to break somebody's knee
 

121
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,229
a lot of power to break somebody's knee
from the side

122
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
from the side
 

123
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,550
from the side
so the pros and cons you're here

124
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
so the pros and cons you're here
 

125
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,750
so the pros and cons you're here
you just pull it back and go back then

126
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
you just pull it back and go back then
 

127
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,429
you just pull it back and go back then
it's like now you've got to start a

128
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
it's like now you've got to start a
 

129
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,990
it's like now you've got to start a
second move up

130
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
second move up
 

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,470
second move up
plus this twist you're going to lose

132
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
plus this twist you're going to lose
 

133
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,509
plus this twist you're going to lose
you're going to lose

134
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
you're going to lose
 

135
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,030
you're going to lose
mass so that means you're going to lose

136
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
mass so that means you're going to lose
 

137
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:25,350
mass so that means you're going to lose
power

138
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360

 

139
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,070

if you watch slowly my hips there's

140
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
if you watch slowly my hips there's
 

141
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,990
if you watch slowly my hips there's
always some movement in the body

142
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
always some movement in the body
 

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,950
always some movement in the body
so i don't make it a two stage this is a

144
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
so i don't make it a two stage this is a
 

145
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,110
so i don't make it a two stage this is a
two stage

146
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120

 

147
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,749

now i've gotta start it again

148
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
now i've gotta start it again
 

149
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,590
now i've gotta start it again
and it has to be one stage

150
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600

 

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:05:00,320

ski get engaged

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,330

 

153
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,629

[Music]

154
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
[Music]
 

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,790
[Music]
so when i'm going back by opening the

156
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
so when i'm going back by opening the
 

157
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,390
so when i'm going back by opening the
foot it's actually

158
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
foot it's actually
 

159
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,310
foot it's actually
not on the foot but it's turning the hip

160
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320

 

161
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,710

we would start in this position in the

162
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
we would start in this position in the
 

163
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:30,230
we would start in this position in the
ready command position

164
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240

 

165
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:52,710

can you see the hips moving

166
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720

 

167
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,110

so by their hips while ending up and

168
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
so by their hips while ending up and
 

169
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,469
so by their hips while ending up and
finding power

170
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
finding power
 

171
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,749
finding power
it's going to give that crack in the

172
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
it's going to give that crack in the
 

173
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,309
it's going to give that crack in the
in the jar isn't it so you can start

174
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
in the jar isn't it so you can start
 

175
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,590
in the jar isn't it so you can start
in both modes

176
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
in both modes
 

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,189
in both modes
this mode
