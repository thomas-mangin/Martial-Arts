I'm Christopher Hine and this week we're

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:16,830
I'm Christopher Hine and this week we're
 

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm Christopher Hine and this week we're
talking about the importance of position

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,650
talking about the importance of position
 

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,109
talking about the importance of position
and how position is what gives birth to

8
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
and how position is what gives birth to
 

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,939
and how position is what gives birth to
technique instead of the other way

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:22,949
technique instead of the other way
 

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,340
technique instead of the other way
around in Aikido we tend to get really

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,350
around in Aikido we tend to get really
 

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,380
around in Aikido we tend to get really
obsessed about the forms and the reason

14
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,390
obsessed about the forms and the reason
 

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,339
obsessed about the forms and the reason
for that is probably because I think

16
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:28,349
for that is probably because I think
 

17
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,679
for that is probably because I think
people thought the techniques that you

18
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:30,689
people thought the techniques that you
 

19
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,870
people thought the techniques that you
as she was using were somehow really

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
as she was using were somehow really
 

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,819
as she was using were somehow really
really special and I think you as she

22
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:34,829
really special and I think you as she
 

23
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,950
really special and I think you as she
was said as much as that that's not what

24
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
was said as much as that that's not what
 

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,630
was said as much as that that's not what
was so special it was the way he

26
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
was so special it was the way he
 

27
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,610
was so special it was the way he
approached stuff that was special in his

28
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,620
approached stuff that was special in his
 

29
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,619
approached stuff that was special in his
ability to understand intent and the way

30
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:42,629
ability to understand intent and the way
 

31
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,529
ability to understand intent and the way
everything unfolded so his students got

32
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:45,539
everything unfolded so his students got
 

33
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,690
everything unfolded so his students got
really into forms and and technical

34
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:47,700
really into forms and and technical
 

35
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,209
really into forms and and technical
aspects and in lots of ways that's been

36
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:50,219
aspects and in lots of ways that's been
 

37
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,590
aspects and in lots of ways that's been
great for Aikido but in lots of ways

38
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
great for Aikido but in lots of ways
 

39
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,119
great for Aikido but in lots of ways
that's also kind of pinned us into a box

40
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,129
that's also kind of pinned us into a box
 

41
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,250
that's also kind of pinned us into a box
and so we think that doing Aikido is

42
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
and so we think that doing Aikido is
 

43
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,110
and so we think that doing Aikido is
about doing the technique or doing the

44
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
about doing the technique or doing the
 

45
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,729
about doing the technique or doing the
form and that it has to look this

46
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:58,739
form and that it has to look this
 

47
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,500
form and that it has to look this
certain way or it's not Aikido

48
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,510
certain way or it's not Aikido
 

49
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,270
certain way or it's not Aikido
the forms and the techniques are very

50
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
the forms and the techniques are very
 

51
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,729
the forms and the techniques are very
important in Aikido and they will teach

52
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:04,739
important in Aikido and they will teach
 

53
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,770
important in Aikido and they will teach
us systematically how the system works

54
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:06,780
us systematically how the system works
 

55
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,170
us systematically how the system works
but they're not the be-all end-all the

56
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,180
but they're not the be-all end-all the
 

57
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,480
but they're not the be-all end-all the
position is significantly more important

58
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,490
position is significantly more important
 

59
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,520
position is significantly more important
than the technique so this week we're

60
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,530
than the technique so this week we're
 

61
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,380
than the technique so this week we're
talking about why positions so important

62
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
talking about why positions so important
 

63
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,450
talking about why positions so important
and how position is what facilitates

64
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:17,460
and how position is what facilitates
 

65
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,929
and how position is what facilitates
techniques last supply our last video we

66
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:20,939
techniques last supply our last video we
 

67
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,810
techniques last supply our last video we
talked about honey and and how hanmi is

68
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:23,820
talked about honey and and how hanmi is
 

69
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,010
talked about honey and and how hanmi is
an important position and what the

70
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,020
an important position and what the
 

71
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,450
an important position and what the
position of hanmi really means and the

72
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,460
position of hanmi really means and the
 

73
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,950
position of hanmi really means and the
techniques that are facilitated by honey

74
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:27,960
techniques that are facilitated by honey
 

75
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,920
techniques that are facilitated by honey
this today we're gonna talk about heat

76
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:30,930
this today we're gonna talk about heat
 

77
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,060
this today we're gonna talk about heat
though and me so the side by side

78
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,070
though and me so the side by side
 

79
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,160
though and me so the side by side
position and what that means and the

80
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,170
position and what that means and the
 

81
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,420
position and what that means and the
techniques that naturally come out of

82
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,430
techniques that naturally come out of
 

83
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,770
techniques that naturally come out of
heat doe and me so I'm gonna get Josh

84
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:36,780
heat doe and me so I'm gonna get Josh
 

85
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,850
heat doe and me so I'm gonna get Josh
over here and we're gonna go to work for

86
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:37,860
over here and we're gonna go to work for
 

87
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,620
over here and we're gonna go to work for
you guys Josh all right so last video we

88
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,630
you guys Josh all right so last video we
 

89
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,480
you guys Josh all right so last video we
talked about a hug me and what hyung is

90
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,490
talked about a hug me and what hyung is
 

91
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,580
talked about a hug me and what hyung is
and honey is a natural byproduct of be

92
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,590
and honey is a natural byproduct of be
 

93
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,109
and honey is a natural byproduct of be
trying to get off line I don't want to

94
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:48,119
trying to get off line I don't want to
 

95
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,240
trying to get off line I don't want to
be squared up in front of this guy so in

96
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,250
be squared up in front of this guy so in
 

97
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,469
be squared up in front of this guy so in
fact that's the last thing in Aikido

98
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
fact that's the last thing in Aikido
 

99
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,300
fact that's the last thing in Aikido
want is to be squared up within distance

100
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,310
want is to be squared up within distance
 

101
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,580
want is to be squared up within distance
to this guy so if he has managed to

102
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,590
to this guy so if he has managed to
 

103
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,630
to this guy so if he has managed to
break the distance remember I'm always

104
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
break the distance remember I'm always
 

105
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,830
break the distance remember I'm always
trying to make distance distance

106
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
trying to make distance distance
 

107
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,810
trying to make distance distance
distance but he's fast or he's got me in

108
00:01:59,810 --> 00:01:59,820
distance but he's fast or he's got me in
 

109
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,550
distance but he's fast or he's got me in
a corner or whatever the next thing I'm

110
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,560
a corner or whatever the next thing I'm
 

111
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,139
a corner or whatever the next thing I'm
trying to do is gain position and while

112
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:03,149
trying to do is gain position and while
 

113
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,730
trying to do is gain position and while
I'm doing that I probably suppressing or

114
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:04,740
I'm doing that I probably suppressing or
 

115
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,350
I'm doing that I probably suppressing or
striking so one of those two things he's

116
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
striking so one of those two things he's
 

117
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,789
striking so one of those two things he's
gonna keep his hands from hitting me or

118
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:07,799
gonna keep his hands from hitting me or
 

119
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,400
gonna keep his hands from hitting me or
be actively hitting him myself as I'm

120
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,410
be actively hitting him myself as I'm
 

121
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,220
be actively hitting him myself as I'm
coming off the first position off

122
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,230
coming off the first position off
 

123
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,589
coming off the first position off
is hug me and hug me just means half

124
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:14,599
is hug me and hug me just means half
 

125
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,240
is hug me and hug me just means half
body position so I'm starting to get to

126
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,250
body position so I'm starting to get to
 

127
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,759
body position so I'm starting to get to
one half of his body whereas here I'm

128
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:18,769
one half of his body whereas here I'm
 

129
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,890
one half of his body whereas here I'm
squared up with them but the first time

130
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:20,900
squared up with them but the first time
 

131
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,000
squared up with them but the first time
I start to move over here now I'm

132
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,010
I start to move over here now I'm
 

133
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,530
I start to move over here now I'm
starting to move to half of his body and

134
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:23,540
starting to move to half of his body and
 

135
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,449
starting to move to half of his body and
then half his body will be all the way

136
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:25,459
then half his body will be all the way
 

137
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,580
then half his body will be all the way
until I get side by side with him it's

138
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,590
until I get side by side with him it's
 

139
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,380
until I get side by side with him it's
if we stand up here side by side so all

140
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,390
if we stand up here side by side so all
 

141
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,030
if we stand up here side by side so all
the way till I get here and this is what

142
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
the way till I get here and this is what
 

143
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,199
the way till I get here and this is what
we call Keith though I mean there's

144
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,209
we call Keith though I mean there's
 

145
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,089
we call Keith though I mean there's
three variations he throw me this is I

146
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:34,099
three variations he throw me this is I
 

147
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,440
three variations he throw me this is I
heat though minx or facing the same

148
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,450
heat though minx or facing the same
 

149
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,479
heat though minx or facing the same
direction it could be choukaku he throw

150
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:37,489
direction it could be choukaku he throw
 

151
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,759
direction it could be choukaku he throw
me so at a 90 degree to him or if I

152
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:39,769
me so at a 90 degree to him or if I
 

153
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,699
me so at a 90 degree to him or if I
turned around that would be

154
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:42,709
turned around that would be
 

155
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,740
turned around that would be
Yakub heat though I mean so I'm just

156
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:44,750
Yakub heat though I mean so I'm just
 

157
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,150
Yakub heat though I mean so I'm just
facing the opposite direction so those

158
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
facing the opposite direction so those
 

159
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,380
facing the opposite direction so those
kind of things could naturally rise

160
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,390
kind of things could naturally rise
 

161
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,809
kind of things could naturally rise
because of all kinds of stuff in Aikido

162

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:52,340
we look at this variation a lot because
 

165
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,369
we look at this variation a lot because
the idea is I'm generally going to be

166
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:54,379

using my eating me tank on my two-step
 

169
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,289
using my eating me tank on my two-step
to get myself to this position if I'm

170
00:02:59,289 --> 00:02:59,299
to get myself to this position if I'm
 

171

into this Keith ome position so I'm
 

183
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,229
into this Keith ome position so I'm
really using that's why we 2 steps so

184
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:11,239
really using that's why we 2 steps so
 

185
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,789

side-by-side position right here okay
 

189
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,259
side-by-side position right here okay
now in this side-by-side position Josh

239
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
of arm side control right so meaning
that I'm gonna use this arm to keep him

240
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,370
that I'm gonna use this arm to keep him
 

241
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,129
that I'm gonna use this arm to keep him
from getting here and start using this

242
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:03,139
from getting here and start using this
 

243
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,229
from getting here and start using this
arm to slide back into the EDMA position

244
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,239
arm to slide back into the EDMA position
 

245
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,490
arm to slide back into the EDMA position
which is what I really want to be I'd

246
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:06,500
which is what I really want to be I'd
 

247
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,229
which is what I really want to be I'd
like to be in that position but it's

248
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
like to be in that position but it's
 

249
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,789
like to be in that position but it's
gonna be hard for me because understand

250
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:09,799
gonna be hard for me because understand
 

251
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:10,930
gonna be hard for me because understand
every time it's not going to be as

252
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:10,940
every time it's not going to be as
 

253
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,789
every time it's not going to be as
simple as we get here and I step here

254
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
simple as we get here and I step here
 

255
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
simple as we get here and I step here
because when we can here he's pushing

256
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,290
because when we can here he's pushing
 

257
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,839
because when we can here he's pushing
this way so when I step here you see

258
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:16,849
this way so when I step here you see
 

259
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,939
this way so when I step here you see
he's no longer there I don't have you be

260
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:18,949
he's no longer there I don't have you be
 

261
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,110
he's no longer there I don't have you be
me in fact I just lost

262
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,120
me in fact I just lost
 

263
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,969
me in fact I just lost
position his be look at this we're now

264
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:21,979
position his be look at this we're now
 

265
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,520
position his be look at this we're now
in the hanmi position so I lost my heap

266
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:24,530
in the hanmi position so I lost my heap
 

267
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,350
in the hanmi position so I lost my heap
though of me which was good and had to

268
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360
though of me which was good and had to
 

269
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,390
though of me which was good and had to
go to an eating me so a lot of times I'm

270
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
go to an eating me so a lot of times I'm
 

271
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
go to an eating me so a lot of times I'm
not just gonna be able to simply slide

272
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,570
not just gonna be able to simply slide
 

273
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,300
not just gonna be able to simply slide
back there the forms make us think all

274
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,310
back there the forms make us think all
 

275
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,189
back there the forms make us think all
just gonna slide back there so my first

276
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
just gonna slide back there so my first
 

277
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,260
just gonna slide back there so my first
set of actions is to hit him here like

278
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,270
set of actions is to hit him here like
 

279
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,090
set of actions is to hit him here like
this bangin would come generally what

280
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,100
this bangin would come generally what
 

281
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,170
this bangin would come generally what
he's gonna do is block with that outside

282
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,180
he's gonna do is block with that outside
 

283
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,580
he's gonna do is block with that outside
handle like that and that's the easy way

284
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:39,590
handle like that and that's the easy way
 

285
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,689
handle like that and that's the easy way
to do it and the reason for that is

286
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:40,699
to do it and the reason for that is
 

287
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,000
to do it and the reason for that is
because his body's pivoting in this way

288
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,010
because his body's pivoting in this way
 

289
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,320
because his body's pivoting in this way
so he's coming in like that so if I hit

290
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,330
so he's coming in like that so if I hit
 

291
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,820
so he's coming in like that so if I hit
him right here what's he gonna do he's

292
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
him right here what's he gonna do he's
 

293
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,050
him right here what's he gonna do he's
gonna bring up that hand thing he's

294
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,060
gonna bring up that hand thing he's
 

295
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,129
gonna bring up that hand thing he's
probably gonna protect himself like that

296
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:48,139
probably gonna protect himself like that
 

297
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,870
probably gonna protect himself like that
that leads us out into all of our

298
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:49,880
that leads us out into all of our
 

299
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,219
that leads us out into all of our
shomenuchi stuff it's the natural

300
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:51,229
shomenuchi stuff it's the natural
 

301
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,740
shomenuchi stuff it's the natural
positions from that okay now what

302
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,750
positions from that okay now what
 

303
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,600
positions from that okay now what
happens if I can't get that so he's

304
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,610
happens if I can't get that so he's
 

305
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,219
happens if I can't get that so he's
pushing passage so let's say comes in

306
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:57,229
pushing passage so let's say comes in
 

307
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,840
pushing passage so let's say comes in
here I push I hit him and he keeps

308
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,850
here I push I hit him and he keeps
 

309
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,430
here I push I hit him and he keeps
pushing in he's pushing and pushing and

310
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
pushing in he's pushing and pushing and
 

311
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,230
pushing in he's pushing and pushing and
pushing it and I can't stop that I'm

312
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
pushing it and I can't stop that I'm
 

313
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,879
pushing it and I can't stop that I'm
going to have to triangle out of that so

314
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:03,889
going to have to triangle out of that so
 

315
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,379
going to have to triangle out of that so
as we go here boom I'll come into this

316
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:05,389
