53
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,429
okay and so the drill we're going to do
now is

54
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
now is
 

55
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,590
now is
um understanding more dynamically what

56
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
um understanding more dynamically what
 

57
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,910
um understanding more dynamically what
you do in your Keyon at at the moment of

58
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920

happens screw that the I of my hand
 

63
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,670
happens screw that the I of my hand
because that's the moment of engagement

64
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:32,680
because that's the moment of engagement
 

65
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,789
because that's the moment of engagement
right there right when he focuses in and

66
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:35,799
right there right when he focuses in and
 

67
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,230
right there right when he focuses in and
starts his movement towards my hand this

68
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
starts his movement towards my hand this
 

69
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,670
starts his movement towards my hand this
is what my you you were noticing and

70
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680

rotating
 

87
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,469
rotating
likewise here when I feel he has a beat

88
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:03,479
likewise here when I feel he has a beat
 

89
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,350
likewise here when I feel he has a beat
on me I have to start the fight rotating

90
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
on me I have to start the fight rotating
 

91
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,830
on me I have to start the fight rotating
you'll take one of those angles to start

92
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:10,840
you'll take one of those angles to start
 

93
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,430
you'll take one of those angles to start
this rotation you cannot wait for him to

94
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:14,440
this rotation you cannot wait for him to
 

95
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,750
this rotation you cannot wait for him to
get into the range where he could use

96
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
get into the range where he could use
 

97
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,790
get into the range where he could use
his line of attack I relate to the setup

98
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800
his line of attack I relate to the setup
 

99
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,030
his line of attack I relate to the setup
of the line of attack okay so I would be

100
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
of the line of attack okay so I would be
 

101
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,030
of the line of attack okay so I would be
constantly moving as he goes in this

102
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
constantly moving as he goes in this
 

103
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,229

that make sense when I throw

724
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799

follow those rules
 

729
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,310
follow those rules
dynamically and

730
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:39,320
dynamically and

quad so as he's going one way let's say

736
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:48,520
quad so as he's going one way let's say
 

737
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,470
quad so as he's going one way let's say
he's going to his right it won't

738
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:51,480
he's going to his right it won't
 

739
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,950

741
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,870
happen because you're stepping it it
tends to happen the other way as he goes

742
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:57,880
tends to happen the other way as he goes
 

743
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,830
tends to happen the other way as he goes
to my left

744
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840

it drags like the friction of the mat
 

747
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,430
it drags like the friction of the mat
starts to drag it you see and so now

748
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
starts to drag it you see and so now
 

749
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,430
starts to drag it you see and so now
you're going to move it and drags it it

750
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
you're going to move it and drags it it

foot will be up okay that that you can

778
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:49,480
foot will be up okay that that you can
 

779
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,510
foot will be up okay that that you can
do that but you we in this drill we

780
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
do that but you we in this drill we
 

781
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,350
do that but you we in this drill we
don't want to be flat heeled so towards

782
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,360
don't want to be flat heeled so towards
 

783
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,149
don't want to be flat heeled so towards
that

784
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:55,159
that
 

785
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,190
that
end as let's say he goes that way and

786
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,200
end as let's say he goes that way and
 

787
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,430
end as let's say he goes that way and
this was supposed to be ball of the

788
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
this was supposed to be ball of the
 

789
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,470
this was supposed to be ball of the
foot he goes doesn't go heal ball of the

790
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:05,480
foot he goes doesn't go heal ball of the
 

791
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,350
foot he goes doesn't go heal ball of the
foot okay cuz for that Split

792
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
foot okay cuz for that Split
 

793
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,990
foot okay cuz for that Split
Second you're over here not following

794
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,000
Second you're over here not following
 

795
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,390
Second you're over here not following
the rules to the line of attack I'm way

796
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,400
the rules to the line of attack I'm way
 

797
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,510
the rules to the line of attack I'm way
more towards the 90 than I am towards

799
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,950
more towards the 90 than I am towards
the 45 on the line of attack okay so

800
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
the 45 on the line of attack okay so
 

801
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,310
the 45 on the line of attack okay so
make sure that you stay on the ball he

802

make sure that you stay on the ball he
 

803
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,149
make sure that you stay on the ball he
go goes it's always the ball the

804
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:33,159
go goes it's always the ball the
 

805
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,590
go goes it's always the ball the
ball okay make sense all right likewise

806
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
ball okay make sense all right likewise
 

807
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,430
ball okay make sense all right likewise
in terms of depth you have to watch just

808
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
in terms of depth you have to watch just
 

809
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,310
in terms of depth you have to watch just
as you have to watch that you don't

foot drag out that you're not heal
 

815
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,669
foot drag out that you're not heal
healing it you also have to watch that

816
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
healing it you also have to watch that
 

817
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,149
healing it you also have to watch that
you don't violate knee heel alignment as

818
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
you don't violate knee heel alignment as
 

819
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,630
you don't violate knee heel alignment as
your minimum depth this is not good for

820
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
your minimum depth this is not good for
 

821
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,630
your minimum depth this is not good for
you okay meaning as he starts to go I

822
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
you okay meaning as he starts to go I
 

823
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,149

usually see it

830
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
usually see it
 

831
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,230
usually see it
well that in that moment that was that

a kind of Step
Shuffle step here well in this moment

838
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,400
Shuffle step here well in this moment
 

839
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,430
Shuffle step here well in this moment
that's it you you lost all your

840
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,440
that's it you you lost all your
 

841
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,149
that's it you you lost all your
offensive capacity so so you have a

842
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
offensive capacity so so you have a
 

843
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,630
offensive capacity so so you have a
couple

844
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,640
couple
 

845
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,990

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,080
Kitty and then I do my Maia tou got the
 

921
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,070
Kitty and then I do my Maia tou got the

923
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,750

okay all this looks like if then

924
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
okay all this looks like if then
 

925
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,389
okay all this looks like if then
mentality if he does this then you do

926
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:05,399
mentality if he does this then you do
 

927
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:10,990
mentality if he does this then you do
that right what's hidden in the if then

928
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,000
that right what's hidden in the if then
 

929
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,750
that right what's hidden in the if then
mentality is the mistake of waiting till

930
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:14,760
mentality is the mistake of waiting till

touch to estab waiting to full grip to
 

933
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,590
touch to estab waiting to full grip to
establish the

934
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:18,600
establish the
 

935
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,110
establish the
relationship okay you're not acting at

936
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,120
relationship okay you're not acting at
 

937
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,430
relationship okay you're not acting at
the level of

938
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440

 

939
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,789

intention any

940
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:29,799

 

941
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,230

counter that you

942
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
counter that you
 

943
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,990
counter that you
do as you learn in an if then

944
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,000
do as you learn in an if then
 

945
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,389
do as you learn in an if then
modality any counter and application is

946
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:40,399
modality any counter and application is
 

947
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,950
modality any counter and application is
all that much better if you do

948
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:43,960
all that much better if you do
 

949
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,470
all that much better if you do
it with other tactics that make his

950
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
it with other tactics that make his
 

951
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,430
it with other tactics that make his
tactic difficult to succeed okay so for

952
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
tactic difficult to succeed okay so for
 

953
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,190
tactic difficult to succeed okay so for
example as he's going for the double leg

954
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,200
example as he's going for the double leg
 

955
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,789
example as he's going for the double leg
if I'm moving

956
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
if I'm moving
 

957
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,230
if I'm moving
the sprawl he gets he gets less of me do

958
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
the sprawl he gets he gets less of me do
 

959
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,630
the sprawl he gets he gets less of me do
you see the sprawl is much easier to

960
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:09,640

 

961
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,830

do in other words the harder I make his

962
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:14,840
do in other words the harder I make his
 

963
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,590
do in other words the harder I make his
the less I provide the ideal environment

964
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
the less I provide the ideal environment
 

965
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,230
the less I provide the ideal environment
for his tactic the more viable my

966
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
for his tactic the more viable my
 

967
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,310
for his tactic the more viable my
counter technique is to that tactic

968
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,320
counter technique is to that tactic
 

969
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,110
counter technique is to that tactic
okay so that's what we're doing here if

970
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,120
okay so that's what we're doing here if
 

971
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,190
okay so that's what we're doing here if
you stay here he has so much advantage

972
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
you stay here he has so much advantage
 

973
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,070
you stay here he has so much advantage
on

974
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
on
 

975
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,710
on
me but if I'm already decreasing

976
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:37,720
me but if I'm already decreasing
 

977
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,990
me but if I'm already decreasing
it at the level go slow slower at the

978
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
it at the level go slow slower at the
 

979
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,710
it at the level go slow slower at the
level of intention you pay attention my

980
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
level of intention you pay attention my
 

981
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,590
level of intention you pay attention my
body's moving my body's moving and this

982
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:48,600
body's moving my body's moving and this
 

983
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,590
body's moving my body's moving and this
becomes easier to

984
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:50,600
becomes easier to
 

985
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,510
becomes easier to
do

986
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
do
 

987
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,310
do
okay so if we take katatori

988
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320

 

989
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,029

a lot of times you're

990
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:00,039
a lot of times you're
 

991
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,269
a lot of times you're
here that would be wrong under this

992
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
here that would be wrong under this
 

993
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,029
here that would be wrong under this
premise okay or a lot of times you guys

994
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039

moved I established the relationship to
the other side you see it's already

1012
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120

 

1013
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,909

1168
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
half and you're going to get out of that
 

1169
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,230
half and you're going to get out of that
grip

1170
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,240
grip
 

1171
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,669

more if you start defending the

00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:34,679
more if you start defending the
 

1173
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,029

there you see so as he's moving I move

1178
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:42,519
there you see so as he's moving I move
 

1179
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,389
there you see so as he's moving I move
there that's going to be much easier to

1180
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
there that's going to be much easier to
 

1181
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,750
there that's going to be much easier to
get out then you wait for full fruition

1182
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
get out then you wait for full fruition
 

1183
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,509
get out then you wait for full fruition
even though you were on the level of

1184
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
even though you were on the level of
 

1185
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,590
even though you were on the level of
intention on the body it's again this is

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:52,600
intention on the body it's again this is
 

1187
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,430
intention on the body it's again this is
more difficult to get out okay so you

1188
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,440
more difficult to get out okay so you
 

1189
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,830
more difficult to get out okay so you
can add that too as go he's going to

1190
00:31:59,830 --> 00:31:59,840
can add that too as go he's going to
 

1191
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,190
can add that too as go he's going to
eventually

1192
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,200
eventually
 

1193
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,269
eventually
close and you rocked that now he's got

1194
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
close and you rocked that now he's got
 

1195
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,590
close and you rocked that now he's got
to really try to get the grip and what

1196
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:08,600
to really try to get the grip and what
 

1197
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,909
to really try to get the grip and what
really try means is he's going to give

1198
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:10,919
really try means is he's going to give
 

1199
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,070
really try means is he's going to give
up more of his neutral neutrality his

1200
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
up more of his neutral neutrality his
 

1201
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,789
up more of his neutral neutrality his
base his balance his inertia his

1202
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
base his balance his inertia his
 

1203
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,710
base his balance his inertia his
momentum all that kind of stuff and

1204
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
momentum all that kind of stuff and
 

1205
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,149
momentum all that kind of stuff and
that's what you want okay so for

1206
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:25,159

 

1207
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,070

example if I try to do the knee pull

1208
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
example if I try to do the knee pull
 

1209
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,950

here and he's much stronger than me I'm
 

1211
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,310
here and he's much stronger than me I'm
not going to get him resist it don't use

1212
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,320
not going to get him resist it don't use
 

1213
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,549
not going to get him resist it don't use
your whole muscles can't get him but as

1214
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
your whole muscles can't get him but as
 

1215
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,950
your whole muscles can't get him but as
he goes to stand up and I know he's

1216
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
he goes to stand up and I know he's
 

1217
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,110
he goes to stand up and I know he's
standing up it's easy peasy

1218
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,120
standing up it's easy peasy
 

1219
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,350
standing up it's easy peasy
okay so the more I do amidst his

1220
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:46,360
okay so the more I do amidst his
 

1221
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,590
okay so the more I do amidst his
technique prior to full fruition the

1222
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
technique prior to full fruition the
 

1223
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,509
technique prior to full fruition the
more his tactic gets compromised the

1224
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:52,519
more his tactic gets compromised the
 

1225
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,629
more his tactic gets compromised the
more my defense becomes

1226
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:54,639
more my defense becomes
 

1227
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,549
more my defense becomes
viable understand so you still might get

1228
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:57,559
viable understand so you still might get
 

1229
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,590

grabed

1230
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:58,600
grabed
 

1231
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,389

but they had to give up a lot more to

1232
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
but they had to give up a lot more to
 

1233
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,509
but they had to give up a lot more to
get that grab and that's what we want

1234
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:02,519
get that grab and that's what we want
 

1235
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,950
get that grab and that's what we want
okay so in this one as they're trying to

1236
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:05,960
okay so in this one as they're trying to
 

1237
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,509
okay so in this one as they're trying to
knock you grab at the level of intention

1238
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:08,519
knock you grab at the level of intention
 

1239
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,149
knock you grab at the level of intention
and they start counter the grab at the

1240
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
and they start counter the grab at the
 

1241
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,269
and they start counter the grab at the
level of intention I want you to really

1242
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:12,279
level of intention I want you to really
 

1243
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,230
level of intention I want you to really
start now trying to get those grabs okay

1244
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,240
start now trying to get those grabs okay
 

1245
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,990
start now trying to get those grabs okay
all right go for

have a physical conditioning limitation

1260
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
have a physical conditioning limitation
 

1261
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,350
