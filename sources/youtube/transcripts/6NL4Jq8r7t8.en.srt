when I was learning koshin I felt like

34
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
when I was learning koshin I felt like
 

35
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,310
when I was learning koshin I felt like
it was something that for beginners was

36
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
it was something that for beginners was
 

37
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,549
it was something that for beginners was
really difficult to learn and and you

38
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
really difficult to learn and and you
 

39
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,910
really difficult to learn and and you
know the students who kind of had

40
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:42,920
know the students who kind of had
 

41
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,389
know the students who kind of had
experience with other things were able

42
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
experience with other things were able
 

43
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,350
experience with other things were able
to get koshinaga pretty quickly but

44
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,360
to get koshinaga pretty quickly but
 

45
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,069
to get koshinaga pretty quickly but
students who had had no experience with

46
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
students who had had no experience with
 

47
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,270
students who had had no experience with
that really seem to have a difficulty

48
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
that really seem to have a difficulty
 

49
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,670
that really seem to have a difficulty
learning kosagi so over the years I

50
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
learning kosagi so over the years I
 

51
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,950
learning kosagi so over the years I
built a very specific way to get

00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:53,960
built a very specific way to get
 

53
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,029
built a very specific way to get
students into koshin and I'm going to

54
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:56,039

koshin I think the way that I get
through it is really straightforward and

70
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:09,799
through it is really straightforward and
 

71
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,230
through it is really straightforward and
will kind of help so I'm going to get

72

all right let's talk about

84
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
all right let's talk about
 

85
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,310
all right let's talk about
Koshi so koshin nag means a hip toss in

86
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
Koshi so koshin nag means a hip toss in
 

87
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,310
Koshi so koshin nag means a hip toss in
iido or hip projection um in iido it's

88
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,320
iido or hip projection um in iido it's
 

89
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,109
iido or hip projection um in iido it's
the throw that I think looks the most

90
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
the throw that I think looks the most
 

91
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,510
the throw that I think looks the most
like a judo throw and so I think it's

92
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
like a judo throw and so I think it's
 

93
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,310
like a judo throw and so I think it's
one of the throws that most of the

94
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
one of the throws that most of the
 

95
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,830
one of the throws that most of the
people who are serious about being

96
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
people who are serious about being
 

97
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,990
people who are serious about being
Marshall really feel like um is a good

98
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
Marshall really feel like um is a good
 

99
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,990
Marshall really feel like um is a good
throw in

100
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,000
throw in
 

101
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,789
throw in
Aikido there is a lot of function in

102
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
Aikido there is a lot of function in
 

103
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,910
Aikido there is a lot of function in
understanding this throw but the time it

104
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
understanding this throw but the time it
 

105
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,670
understanding this throw but the time it
takes generally to set it up isn't

106
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:00,680
takes generally to set it up isn't
 

107
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,950
takes generally to set it up isn't
useful for us and so most of the time

108
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
useful for us and so most of the time
 

109
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,510
useful for us and so most of the time
when we're we're doing koshin they

110
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,520
when we're we're doing koshin they
 

111
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,550
when we're we're doing koshin they
should kind of just be set up on the fly

112
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
should kind of just be set up on the fly
 

113
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,790
should kind of just be set up on the fly
so it really doesn't work as well as

114
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
so it really doesn't work as well as
 

115
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,949
so it really doesn't work as well as
judo throws for clinch grappling as judo

116
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:11,959
judo throws for clinch grappling as judo
 

117
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,750
judo throws for clinch grappling as judo
throws do so um if you're going to

118
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
throws do so um if you're going to
 

119
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,670
throws do so um if you're going to
clinch grapple there's not a way around

120
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
clinch grapple there's not a way around
 

121
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,750
clinch grapple there's not a way around
it you can't really master koshin and

122
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
it you can't really master koshin and
 

123
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,670
it you can't really master koshin and
then you know as much as a judo guy you

124
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
then you know as much as a judo guy you
 

125
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,830
then you know as much as a judo guy you
still got to do Judo right so um it's

126
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:22,840
still got to do Judo right so um it's
 

127
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,509
still got to do Judo right so um it's
not a lot of what people think it is and

128
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:24,519
not a lot of what people think it is and
 

129
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,150
not a lot of what people think it is and
in fact I think a lot of the time what's

130
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
in fact I think a lot of the time what's
 

131
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,070

hips and the reason that happens is
because you know so kosin most of the

162
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
because you know so kosin most of the
 

163
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,070
because you know so kosin most of the
time and you see it mostly in the fors

164
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,080
time and you see it mostly in the fors
 

165
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,070
time and you see it mostly in the fors
like this it's coming because we have a

166
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
like this it's coming because we have a
 

167
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,990
like this it's coming because we have a
wide situation there's a few exceptions

168
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
wide situation there's a few exceptions
 

169
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,270
wide situation there's a few exceptions
like a riot or there's a couple

170
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280
like a riot or there's a couple
 

171
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,789
like a riot or there's a couple
exceptions to this but generally have a

172
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:11,799
exceptions to this but generally have a
 

173
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,910
exceptions to this but generally have a
wide situation and so what's happening

174
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
wide situation and so what's happening
 

175
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,789
wide situation and so what's happening
for the koshinaga is as he's pushing

176
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:15,799
for the koshinaga is as he's pushing
 

177
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,630
for the koshinaga is as he's pushing
into that I'm coming down low boom and

178
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:17,640
into that I'm coming down low boom and
 

179
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,789
into that I'm coming down low boom and
catching him right here and then in that

180
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:19,799
catching him right here and then in that
 

181
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,910
catching him right here and then in that
catching um I can kind of just shove him

182
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
catching um I can kind of just shove him
 

183
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,190
catching um I can kind of just shove him
off a little bit right which gives me

184
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
off a little bit right which gives me
 

185
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,070
off a little bit right which gives me
the ability to to escape out of there so

186
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,080
the ability to to escape out of there so
 

187
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,589
the ability to to escape out of there so
it kind of kind of gives me a little

188
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:26,599
it kind of kind of gives me a little
 

189
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,949
it kind of kind of gives me a little
oomph to get out of there and that's the

190
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:27,959
oomph to get out of there and that's the
 

191
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,910
oomph to get out of there and that's the
way I use it most of the time is just

192
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
way I use it most of the time is just
 

193
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,750
way I use it most of the time is just
kind of this really simple little pop in

194
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
kind of this really simple little pop in
 

195
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,990
kind of this really simple little pop in
fact when you see it done in our gazer

196
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
fact when you see it done in our gazer
 

197
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,630
fact when you see it done in our gazer
randori most of the time it really

198
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:35,640
randori most of the time it really
 

199
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,949
randori most of the time it really
doesn't look like anything other than a

200
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
doesn't look like anything other than a
 

201
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,390
doesn't look like anything other than a
little bump and the guy kind of stumbles

202
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
little bump and the guy kind of stumbles
 

203
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,429
little bump and the guy kind of stumbles
back and then the other guy can escape

204
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:40,439
back and then the other guy can escape
 

205
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,270
back and then the other guy can escape
so that's how we use it most of the time

206
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,280
so that's how we use it most of the time
 

207
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,949
so that's how we use it most of the time
um however I think the full function of

208
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:43,959
um however I think the full function of
 

209
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,229
um however I think the full function of
learning how it works is really good

210
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
learning how it works is really good
 

211
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,509
learning how it works is really good
it's really good for learning to take

212
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:46,519
it's really good for learning to take
 

213
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:47,990
it's really good for learning to take
body weight and it's really good for

214
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
body weight and it's really good for
 

215
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,990
body weight and it's really good for
learning to fall and to trust your fall

216
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
learning to fall and to trust your fall
 

217
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
learning to fall and to trust your fall
so a lot of really good stuff comes from

218
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
so a lot of really good stuff comes from
 

219
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,550
so a lot of really good stuff comes from
that all right so I'm going to show you

220
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:53,560
that all right so I'm going to show you
 

221
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,910
that all right so I'm going to show you
how I would teach a beginner to do this

222
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
how I would teach a beginner to do this
 

223
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,550
how I would teach a beginner to do this
so and I'll use Josh because uh I'm

224
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,560
so and I'll use Josh because uh I'm
 

225
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,190
so and I'll use Josh because uh I'm
going to mess up my mic pack if I if I

226
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
going to mess up my mic pack if I if I
 

227
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,350
going to mess up my mic pack if I if I
do this wrong so okay uh what I would

228
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
do this wrong so okay uh what I would
 

229
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,069
do this wrong so okay uh what I would
have the beginner do is just bend over

230
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,079
have the beginner do is just bend over
 

231
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,110
have the beginner do is just bend over
right in half so they make this L shape

232
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
right in half so they make this L shape
 

233
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,149
right in half so they make this L shape
like this okay first thing I would do is

234
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
like this okay first thing I would do is
 

235
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,869
like this okay first thing I would do is
explain to them that if uh you resist me

236
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:09,879
explain to them that if uh you resist me
 

237
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,910
explain to them that if uh you resist me
and I push High okay you feel that in

238
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
and I push High okay you feel that in
 

239
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,830
and I push High okay you feel that in
your low back and if I resist you and

240
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
your low back and if I resist you and
 

241
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,189
your low back and if I resist you and
you push high now you feel nothing right

242
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
you push high now you feel nothing right
 

243
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,749
you push high now you feel nothing right
okay so that's really easy for Josh he

244
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
okay so that's really easy for Josh he
 

245
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,670
okay so that's really easy for Josh he
can do that all day whereas if I push up

246
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
can do that all day whereas if I push up
 

247
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,270
can do that all day whereas if I push up
here and he resists that's some work for

248
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
here and he resists that's some work for
 

249
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,870
here and he resists that's some work for
him right so and and take that time to

250
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:23,880
him right so and and take that time to
 

251
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,670
him right so and and take that time to
explain that if they're sitting right

252
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
explain that if they're sitting right
 

253
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,909
explain that if they're sitting right
where your belt is on your hips then

254
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
where your belt is on your hips then
 

255
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,150
where your belt is on your hips then
actually let me put it this way so it's

256
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
actually let me put it this way so it's
 

257
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,390
actually let me put it this way so it's
easy to see I don't know maybe I can get

258
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
easy to see I don't know maybe I can get
 

259
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,629
easy to see I don't know maybe I can get
with the other cameras but if they're

260
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:31,639
with the other cameras but if they're
 

261
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,990
with the other cameras but if they're
right here where your hips are then you

262
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
right here where your hips are then you
 

263
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,110
right here where your hips are then you
you're going to have a lot more

264
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
you're going to have a lot more
 

265
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,230
you're going to have a lot more
stability uh whereas up here your low

266
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
stability uh whereas up here your low
 

267
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,550
stability uh whereas up here your low
back's going to take the work because of

268
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
back's going to take the work because of
 

269
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,870
back's going to take the work because of
the lever of the back and so I just

270
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:39,880
the lever of the back and so I just
 

271
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,070
the lever of the back and so I just
basically take some time and explain

272
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,080
basically take some time and explain
 

273
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,230
basically take some time and explain
that to them and tell them you know when

274
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
that to them and tell them you know when
 

275
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,710
that to them and tell them you know when
you're putting someone uh setting

276
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:43,720
you're putting someone uh setting
 

277
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,270
you're putting someone uh setting
someone up for koshinaga you don't want

278
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
someone up for koshinaga you don't want
 

279
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,629
someone up for koshinaga you don't want
them up here because it's hard on your

280
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
them up here because it's hard on your
 

281
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,870
them up here because it's hard on your
back you want to make sure that they're

282
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
back you want to make sure that they're
 

283
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,110
back you want to make sure that they're
down here so that's the first part of it

284
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,120
down here so that's the first part of it
 

285
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,670
down here so that's the first part of it
okay next part is I'd have them bend

286
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,680
okay next part is I'd have them bend
 

287
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,469
okay next part is I'd have them bend
over and I don't want them to bend their

288
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
over and I don't want them to bend their
 

289
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,070
over and I don't want them to bend their
knees or anything else and then I have

290
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
knees or anything else and then I have
 

291
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,110
knees or anything else and then I have
their partner just lay across okay and

292
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
their partner just lay across okay and
 

293
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,670
their partner just lay across okay and
then Josh is going to see if there's any

294
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
then Josh is going to see if there's any
 

295
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,469
then Josh is going to see if there's any
way he could pick me up or anything else

296
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:03,479
way he could pick me up or anything else
 

297
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,270
way he could pick me up or anything else
from this position right and he can't

298
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
from this position right and he can't
 

299
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,510
from this position right and he can't
nothing right my my feet are on the

300
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
nothing right my my feet are on the
 

301
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,909
nothing right my my feet are on the
ground okay now I will say when you're

302
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:08,919
ground okay now I will say when you're
 

303
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,070
ground okay now I will say when you're
doing this really make sure that the UK

304
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
doing this really make sure that the UK
 

305
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,230
doing this really make sure that the UK
so that's me in this case um resists the

306
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
so that's me in this case um resists the
 

307
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,270
so that's me in this case um resists the
urge to load themselves up where they

308
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,280
urge to load themselves up where they
 

309
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,350
urge to load themselves up where they
should be right so they shouldn't be

310
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
should be right so they shouldn't be
 

311
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,469
should be right so they shouldn't be
trying to do that they should just be

312
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
trying to do that they should just be
 

313
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,629
trying to do that they should just be
flat footed and they should lean forward

314
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
flat footed and they should lean forward
 

315
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,150
flat footed and they should lean forward
and see if they get up anywhere right

316
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
and see if they get up anywhere right
 

317
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,749
and see if they get up anywhere right
and and they won't okay now next next

318
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:24,759
and and they won't okay now next next
 

319
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,629
and and they won't okay now next next
thing you tell him is okay now this guy

320
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
thing you tell him is okay now this guy
 

321
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,670
thing you tell him is okay now this guy
so what Josh is going to do is he's

322
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
so what Josh is going to do is he's
 

323
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,110
so what Josh is going to do is he's
going to bend his knees so his hips are

324
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
going to bend his knees so his hips are
 

325
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,510
going to bend his knees so his hips are
a little lower than mine right so a

326
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,520
a little lower than mine right so a
 

327
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,230
a little lower than mine right so a
little lower and now I'm going to do the

328
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
little lower and now I'm going to do the
 

329
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,550
little lower and now I'm going to do the
same thing I'm just going to lean

330
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:33,560
same thing I'm just going to lean
 

331
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,950
same thing I'm just going to lean
forward and Josh going to see if he can

332
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
forward and Josh going to see if he can
 

333
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,790
forward and Josh going to see if he can
get me up at all H not really not really

334
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:37,800
get me up at all H not really not really
 

335
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,550
get me up at all H not really not really
too much right a little bit but not too

336
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:39,560
too much right a little bit but not too
 

337
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,830
too much right a little bit but not too
much okay so that's the next stage in

338
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
much okay so that's the next stage in
 

339
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,309
much okay so that's the next stage in
the progression and again from this

340
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:43,319
the progression and again from this
 

341
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,830
the progression and again from this
stage make sure that the this person

342
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
stage make sure that the this person
 

343
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,950
stage make sure that the this person
isn't really trying to jump up on there

344
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:47,960
isn't really trying to jump up on there
 

345
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,749
isn't really trying to jump up on there
and set themselves up all they're doing

346
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
and set themselves up all they're doing
 

347
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,309
and set themselves up all they're doing
is leaning forward and seeing where they

348
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,319
is leaning forward and seeing where they
 

349
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,670
is leaning forward and seeing where they
get okay now next stage is Josh is going

350
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,680
get okay now next stage is Josh is going
 

351
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,830
get okay now next stage is Josh is going
to lean his back towards me like this so

352
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:56,840
to lean his back towards me like this so
 

353
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,230
to lean his back towards me like this so
see how he's like arching his or arching

354
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,240
see how he's like arching his or arching
 

355
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,469
see how he's like arching his or arching
like til tilting his back towards me so

356
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:01,479
like til tilting his back towards me so
 

357
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:02,670
like til tilting his back towards me so
then from this tilting the back on

358
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:02,680
then from this tilting the back on
 

359
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,950
then from this tilting the back on
forwards I'm going to do exactly the

360
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:03,960
forwards I'm going to do exactly the
 

361
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,230
forwards I'm going to do exactly the
same thing I'm just going to lay forward

362
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,240
same thing I'm just going to lay forward
 

363
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,469
same thing I'm just going to lay forward
exactly like I did before and he's going

364
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
exactly like I did before and he's going
 

365
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,150
exactly like I did before and he's going
to twist a little bit and look all of a

366
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
to twist a little bit and look all of a
 

367
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,790
to twist a little bit and look all of a
sudden my hips come up really really

368
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,800
sudden my hips come up really really
 

369
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,110
sudden my hips come up really really
nice up off the ground okay and that's

370
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
nice up off the ground okay and that's
 

371
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,070
nice up off the ground okay and that's
because of this this progression of

372
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
because of this this progression of
 

373
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,469
because of this this progression of
ideas now when we teach it to our

374
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
ideas now when we teach it to our
 

375
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,390
ideas now when we teach it to our
students a lot of times we forget all

376
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:19,400
students a lot of times we forget all
 

377
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,830
students a lot of times we forget all
these little things that we know how to

378
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:20,840
these little things that we know how to
 

379
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,710
these little things that we know how to
do and so it's kind of hard you got to

380
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
do and so it's kind of hard you got to
 

381
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,469
do and so it's kind of hard you got to
kind of reverse engineer like well how

382
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
kind of reverse engineer like well how
 

383
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,589
kind of reverse engineer like well how
do I get that really nice throw to set

384
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:26,599
do I get that really nice throw to set
 

385
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,830
do I get that really nice throw to set
up like that so this is a way I think

386
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
up like that so this is a way I think
 

387
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,430
up like that so this is a way I think
it's really clear for students and when

388
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
it's really clear for students and when
 

389
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,230
it's really clear for students and when
you have them like well can you get

390
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
you have them like well can you get
 

391
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,710
you have them like well can you get
their feet up off the ground easily or

392
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
their feet up off the ground easily or
 

393
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,870
their feet up off the ground easily or
not get their feet up off the ground

394
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
not get their feet up off the ground
 

395
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,390
not get their feet up off the ground
easily and they kind of see this

396
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,400
easily and they kind of see this
 

397
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,510
easily and they kind of see this
progression and how you know like making

398
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
progression and how you know like making
 

399
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,990
progression and how you know like making
sure that their hips are lower that's

400
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,000
sure that their hips are lower that's
 

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,189
sure that their hips are lower that's
one thing they have to do making sure

402
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:42,199
one thing they have to do making sure
 

403
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,830
one thing they have to do making sure
they tilt their back towards the other

404
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
they tilt their back towards the other
 

405
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,270
they tilt their back towards the other
person that's one thing they have to do

406
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
person that's one thing they have to do
 

407
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,189
person that's one thing they have to do
and then rolling over and standing up as

408
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
and then rolling over and standing up as
 

409
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,710
and then rolling over and standing up as
one action that's another thing they

410
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
one action that's another thing they
 

411
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,950
one action that's another thing they
have to do and so I think that breaks it

412
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
have to do and so I think that breaks it
 

413
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,589
have to do and so I think that breaks it
down simple enough for beginners that

414
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:52,599
down simple enough for beginners that
 

415
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,230
down simple enough for beginners that
they can get it and I've had a lot of

416
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
they can get it and I've had a lot of
 

417
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,629
they can get it and I've had a lot of
lot of success with this meaning a lot

418
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:55,639
lot of success with this meaning a lot
 

419
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,629
lot of success with this meaning a lot
of times people come in off the street

420
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
of times people come in off the street
 

421
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,830
of times people come in off the street
and I get them doing koshin day one so

422
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:58,840
and I get them doing koshin day one so
 

423
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,990
and I get them doing koshin day one so
it's a good method in my experience to

424
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,000
it's a good method in my experience to
 

425
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,629
it's a good method in my experience to
use um as far as that goes really

426
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:03,639
use um as far as that goes really
 

427
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,830
use um as far as that goes really
there's not that much in-depth crazy

428
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
there's not that much in-depth crazy
 

429
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,749
there's not that much in-depth crazy
stuff about koshinaga it's a hip throt

430
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
stuff about koshinaga it's a hip throt
 

431
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,670
stuff about koshinaga it's a hip throt
toss um it looks really big and

432
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
toss um it looks really big and
 

433
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,309
toss um it looks really big and
demonstrations and pretty in my

434
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:11,319
demonstrations and pretty in my
 

435
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,390
demonstrations and pretty in my
experience practically it almost never

436
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,400
experience practically it almost never
 

437
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,270
experience practically it almost never
comes off like that now I have video I

438
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,280
comes off like that now I have video I
 

439
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,150
comes off like that now I have video I
think I put up not too long ago actually

440
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
think I put up not too long ago actually
 

441
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,029
think I put up not too long ago actually
of me doing it years ago I did a really

442
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
of me doing it years ago I did a really
 

443
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,710
of me doing it years ago I did a really
nice koshin on Michael Varon um that

444
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
nice koshin on Michael Varon um that
 

445
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,749
nice koshin on Michael Varon um that
that is not the kind you see in this um

446
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:24,759
that is not the kind you see in this um
 

447
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,869
that is not the kind you see in this um
so they do can totally happen in our

448
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:26,879
so they do can totally happen in our
 

449
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,790
so they do can totally happen in our
iido experience but um they're not they

450
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:29,800
iido experience but um they're not they
 

451
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,189
iido experience but um they're not they
don't work best for that right in my

452
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
don't work best for that right in my
 

453
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,150
don't work best for that right in my
opinion most of the time they're just

454
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
opinion most of the time they're just
 

455
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,430
opinion most of the time they're just
kind of this little boom and they kind

456
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
kind of this little boom and they kind
 

457
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,469
kind of this little boom and they kind
of fly off and and you get away which is

458
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
of fly off and and you get away which is
 

459
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,909
of fly off and and you get away which is
most of the time what we want them for

460
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:36,919
most of the time what we want them for
 

461
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,790
most of the time what we want them for
in Nido but I think they're a good

462
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
in Nido but I think they're a good
 

463
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,510
in Nido but I think they're a good
practice tool for all the reasons I said

464
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
practice tool for all the reasons I said
 

465
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,830
practice tool for all the reasons I said
and I think this is a good progression

466
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
and I think this is a good progression
 

467
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,749
and I think this is a good progression
to get through to that um so yeah I

468
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:44,759
to get through to that um so yeah I
 

469
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,869
to get through to that um so yeah I
don't have a lot of exciting stuff to

470
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:45,879
don't have a lot of exciting stuff to
 

471
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,589
don't have a lot of exciting stuff to
say about kosagi it's a good throw um
