00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,549
this energy fluidity I want him to keep
moving that's my goal I don't want to

stop him here are the ways that you can

26
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
stop him here are the ways that you can
 

27
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,500
stop him here are the ways that you can
keep him moving let him move himself do

28
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,510
keep him moving let him move himself do
 

29
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,930

multiple things right let him move

I'm using that friction so wool friction

34
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119

 

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,170

third way leverage do you see that this

36
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,180
third way leverage do you see that this
 

37
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,550
third way leverage do you see that this
fourth way of grabbing pulling I vote I

fourth way of grabbing pulling I vote I
 

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,260

don't want you to count it as a fourth

40
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,270
don't want you to count it as a fourth
 

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,390
don't want you to count it as a fourth
way okay in this training keep it moving

42
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
way okay in this training keep it moving

that's the friction that's not the

leverage do that same thing again to

46
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,049
leverage do that same thing again to

and let him go where you going

54
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:46,600
and let him go where you going
 

55
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:57,190
and let him go where you going
same technique see that a few right let

56
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
same technique see that a few right let
 

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,710

him go where he's going over here

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:25,680

Frick same thing even the obvious

ones so I come in here and you're

getting your own neck crank same thing

getting your own neck crank same thing
 

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,560

friction right poom not a neck crank

68

friction right poom not a neck crank
 

69
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,020

much okay

70
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,030
