197
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,080
right you're gonna be better in the long
run for that and just understand that

198
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,090
run for that and just understand that
 

199
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,890
run for that and just understand that
natural process - hey this person is

200
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
natural process - hey this person is
 

201
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,060
natural process - hey this person is
comfortable but structurally get a hold

202
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,070
comfortable but structurally get a hold
 

203
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,700
comfortable but structurally get a hold
of that why because you won't let go of

204
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:34,710
of that why because you won't let go of
 

205
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,220
of that why because you won't let go of
yourself that's not the training that's

206
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,230
yourself that's not the training that's
 

207
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,520
yourself that's not the training that's
the opposite of the train

208
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,530

 

209
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,600

drill but like one point I was trying to

212
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,010
drill but like one point I was trying to
 

213
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,440
drill but like one point I was trying to
follow them it almost felt like they

00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:58,750
were moving me the safe just trying to
 

217
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:09,530
were moving me the safe just trying to
stay sticky which world were you noggin

218
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:09,540

 

219
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,430

so you're not gay

220
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
so you're not gay
 

221
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,170
so you're not gay
and then you're saying they're trying to

222
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,180
and then you're saying they're trying to
 

223
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:35,790
and then you're saying they're trying to
move yeah you're doing this row

224
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:35,800

 

225
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,330

I I'm not sure what that means but I if

226
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,340
I I'm not sure what that means but I if
 

227
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,809
I I'm not sure what that means but I if
I use that phrase I think that is closer

228
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:42,819
I use that phrase I think that is closer
 

229
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,439
I use that phrase I think that is closer
to to me as not yet moving them to being

230
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,449
to to me as not yet moving them to being
 

231
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,149
to to me as not yet moving them to being
correct

232
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:47,159
correct
 

233
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,460
correct
okay often say they're telling you where

234
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,470
okay often say they're telling you where
 

235
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,089
okay often say they're telling you where
to go right because their their movement

236
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:54,099
to go right because their their movement
 

237
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,369
to go right because their their movement
is generating the in spaces and so

238
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:56,379
is generating the in spaces and so
 

239
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,469
is generating the in spaces and so
you're filling the in spaces you're

240
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
you're filling the in spaces you're
 

241
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,860
you're filling the in spaces you're
harmonizing to their young with your yen

242
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:01,870
harmonizing to their young with your yen
 

243
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,309
harmonizing to their young with your yen
and right vice versa so they have to be

244
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,319
and right vice versa so they have to be
 

245
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,600
and right vice versa so they have to be
telling you where to go

246
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,610
telling you where to go
 

247
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,879
telling you where to go
the only limitation to that is when it

248
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:11,889
the only limitation to that is when it
 

249
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,279
the only limitation to that is when it
comes to these deeper levels of musubi

250
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,289
comes to these deeper levels of musubi
 

251
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:23,209
comes to these deeper levels of musubi
right it stops making sense then that

252
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:23,219
right it stops making sense then that
 

253
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:29,939
right it stops making sense then that
they the action-reaction dichotomy isn't

254
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:29,949
they the action-reaction dichotomy isn't
 

255
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:37,830
they the action-reaction dichotomy isn't
as quite readily usable okay you don't

256
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
as quite readily usable okay you don't
 

257
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,140
as quite readily usable okay you don't
have that sense like that's what I mean

258
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,150
have that sense like that's what I mean
 

259
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,510
have that sense like that's what I mean
you have the sense that slow motion in a

260
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,520
you have the sense that slow motion in a
 

261
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,969
you have the sense that slow motion in a
drill where you're working on connection

262
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:44,979
drill where you're working on connection
 

263
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,070
drill where you're working on connection
you will develop that sense but when

264
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
you will develop that sense but when
 

265
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
you will develop that sense but when
it's a free-for-all and everyone can do

266
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,090
it's a free-for-all and everyone can do
 

267
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,649
it's a free-for-all and everyone can do
whatever you won't even remember what

268
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:52,659
whatever you won't even remember what
 

269
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,870
whatever you won't even remember what
you did let alone that they made you do

270
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:54,880
you did let alone that they made you do
 

271
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:23,279
you did let alone that they made you do
it that that connection is really the

272
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,289
it that that connection is really the
 

273
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:26,369
it that that connection is really the
only thing that is Marshall when you

274
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:26,379
only thing that is Marshall when you
 

275
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:32,170
only thing that is Marshall when you
have that it doesn't matter what you do

276
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,180

 

277
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,120

but if you don't have that it also

278
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,130
but if you don't have that it also
 

279
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,209
but if you don't have that it also
doesn't matter what you do okay in a

280
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,219
doesn't matter what you do okay in a
 

281
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,129
doesn't matter what you do okay in a
sport environment where the the

282
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:40,139
sport environment where the the
 

283
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,719
sport environment where the the
opponent's on the other side of the Ring

284
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:41,729
opponent's on the other side of the Ring
 

285
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,279
opponent's on the other side of the Ring
and a different pair of colored shorts

286
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,289
and a different pair of colored shorts
 

287
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,460
and a different pair of colored shorts
and there's a ref and then it's okay but

288
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,470
and there's a ref and then it's okay but
 

289
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,259
and there's a ref and then it's okay but
in in the real environment we're

290
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:48,269
in in the real environment we're
 

291
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,389
in in the real environment we're
ambushed right and and you always being

292
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:53,399
ambushed right and and you always being
 

293
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,930
ambushed right and and you always being
on the reactionary side of something if

294
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:55,940
on the reactionary side of something if
 

295
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,180
on the reactionary side of something if
you can't have that invisible connection

296
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,190
you can't have that invisible connection
 

297
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,680
you can't have that invisible connection
right because you can't see it and we're

298
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:03,690
right because you can't see it and we're
 

299
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,629
right because you can't see it and we're
not touching it's not it's not I don't

300
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:05,639
not touching it's not it's not I don't
 

301
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,400
not touching it's not it's not I don't
think it's magical at all

302
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,410
think it's magical at all
 

303
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,860
think it's magical at all
I think it's the same senses that you

304
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:12,870
I think it's the same senses that you
 

305
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,449
I think it's the same senses that you
always use but just like at other levels

306
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:17,459
always use but just like at other levels
 

307
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,879
always use but just like at other levels
grosser levels excuse me the self gets

308
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:22,889
grosser levels excuse me the self gets
 

309
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,420
grosser levels excuse me the self gets
in the way of my sensory perception

310
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,430
in the way of my sensory perception
 

311
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,889
in the way of my sensory perception
right so what if I could have less self

312
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:30,899
right so what if I could have less self
 

313
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,740
right so what if I could have less self
that gets in the way it would stand a

314
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:33,750
that gets in the way it would stand a
 

315
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,259
that gets in the way it would stand a
reason then that those same sense sense

316
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:36,269
reason then that those same sense sense
 

317
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,019
reason then that those same sense sense
tools would be more perceptive I think

318
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:39,029
tools would be more perceptive I think
 

319
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,050
tools would be more perceptive I think
that's what's going on I think we do it

320
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,060
that's what's going on I think we do it
 

321
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,679
that's what's going on I think we do it
all the time

322
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:42,689
all the time
 

323
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:46,100
all the time

411
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,210

so we might call somebody oh he's very

412
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,220
so we might call somebody oh he's very

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,780
she's very right intuitive that it's
just they're not getting in the way of

just they're not getting in the way of
what they're observing of what they're

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
what they're observing of what they're
 

419
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,230
what they're observing of what they're
sensing so it could be a dog or a pet

420
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
sensing so it could be a dog or a pet
 

421
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,160

you're just not in the way of the

430
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200

if you want to give some kind of goals
 

437
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,540
if you want to give some kind of goals
to your training that has to be one of

438
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,550
to your training that has to be one of

obsession and we forget about the skill
 

455
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,330

that's what it is

464
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800

 

465
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,110

that kind of training is very difficult

466
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,120
that kind of training is very difficult
 

467
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,380
that kind of training is very difficult

you don't get to say what it is

818
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:33,429
you don't get to say what it is
 

819
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:38,109
you don't get to say what it is
certainly not by asking one person

820
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:38,119

 

821
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,079

but there's also a history of thought

822
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:40,089
but there's also a history of thought
 

823
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:43,749
but there's also a history of thought
and there's no way you would have a cue

824
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:43,759
and there's no way you would have a cue
 

825
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,459
and there's no way you would have a cue
door in Aikido or anything like that

826
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:45,469
door in Aikido or anything like that
 

827
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:49,209
door in Aikido or anything like that
without a concept pre-existing both the

without a concept pre-existing both the
 

829
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,519
without a concept pre-existing both the
formation of those two things that made

830
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:51,529
formation of those two things that made
 

831
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,039
formation of those two things that made
it possible that you could reach some

832
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,049
it possible that you could reach some
 

833
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,129
it possible that you could reach some
sort of spiritual awakening of some kind

834
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:57,139
sort of spiritual awakening of some kind
 

835
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,639
sort of spiritual awakening of some kind
some sort of self cultivation through an

836
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:00,649
some sort of self cultivation through an
 

837
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,700
some sort of self cultivation through an
entirely otherwise secular practice

838
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:05,710
entirely otherwise secular practice
 

839
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,360
entirely otherwise secular practice
that history had to proceed

840
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,370

 

841
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,940

before you put dough on the end of cue

842
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:16,950

 

843
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,820

and in that from the perspective of the

844
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:19,830
and in that from the perspective of the
 

845
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,580
and in that from the perspective of the
history of thought there is no Kudo

846
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,590
history of thought there is no Kudo
 

847
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,090
history of thought there is no Kudo
without Zen not possible but is it

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,100
without Zen not possible but is it
 

849
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,670
without Zen not possible but is it
possible for anyone do Kudo without

possible for anyone do Kudo without
 

851
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,650
possible for anyone do Kudo without
having any connection at all about Zen

noticed everyone does

868
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:55,990

 

869
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,499

it's kind of cute but is totally true

870
00:24:58,499 --> 00:24:58,509
it's kind of cute but is totally true
 

871
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:03,070
it's kind of cute but is totally true
isn't it

I'm doing whatever I want this is how
 

875
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm doing whatever I want this is how
this is how I understand the art the art

has a history when people started
talking like that that there was an

talking like that that there was an
Aikido outside of the individual

Aikido outside of the individual
 

891
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,930
Aikido outside of the individual
practitioner there's a history to that

that's not a given
 

895
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,039
that's not a given
you could go on to define it for

896
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,049
you could go on to define it for
 

897
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:47,450
you could go on to define it for
everybody for all times

898
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,460

 

899
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,729

there's a history there's people who

900
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:49,739
there's a history there's people who
 

901
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:53,950
there's a history there's people who
came up with that idea

902
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:53,960

 

903
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,889

and just because I say has nothing to do

and just because I say has nothing to do
 

905
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,659

history of fun you could read everything

00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:11,539
as a rebellion against
 

913
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:18,810
as a rebellion against
this universal thing called Aikido

914

915
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,120

I wouldn't make sense if there wasn't

I wouldn't make sense if there wasn't
 

917

919
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,039

just like the Zen hermit doesn't make

920
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,049
just like the Zen hermit doesn't make
 

921
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:35,850
just like the Zen hermit doesn't make
sense if there was no monastery

923
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,490

kind of like the atheist even

931
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,520

like what who

like what who
 

933
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,210
like what who
to tests to say there's no God is to be

934
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:58,220
to tests to say there's no God is to be
 

935
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,130
to tests to say there's no God is to be
obsessed with it's like a jilted lover

936
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,140
obsessed with it's like a jilted lover
 

937
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,900
obsessed with it's like a jilted lover
I'm so over that guy I'm so over him

938
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:03,910
I'm so over that guy I'm so over him
 

939
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm so over that guy I'm so over him
everyone else is going

940
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:08,810

 

941
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:14,380

right to proclaim atheism is to be

942
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,390
right to proclaim atheism is to be
 

943
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,690
right to proclaim atheism is to be
probably the more devout believer than

944
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:16,700
probably the more devout believer than
 

945
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,539
probably the more devout believer than
most believers nowadays

946
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:20,549
most believers nowadays
 

947
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,690
most believers nowadays
most believers are very inconsistent and

948
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,700
most believers are very inconsistent and
 

949
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,709
most believers are very inconsistent and
hypocritical but the Atheist is going to

950
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:26,719
hypocritical but the Atheist is going to
 

951
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,629
hypocritical but the Atheist is going to
take their atheism everywhere with them

952
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:29,639
take their atheism everywhere with them
 

953
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:38,600
take their atheism everywhere with them
and make sure you know it right

954
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:38,610

 

955
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,409

so there's the question okay how do I do

956
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:42,419
so there's the question okay how do I do
 

957
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,500
so there's the question okay how do I do
this how do I put my spirit into this

958
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:47,510

 

959
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,000

you're not satisfied with my answer

960
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,010
you're not satisfied with my answer
 

961
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,100
you're not satisfied with my answer
and you probably shouldn't be not at an

962
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,110
and you probably shouldn't be not at an
 

963
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,090
and you probably shouldn't be not at an
individual level

964
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,100

 

965
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,930

but I would say you know it's probably

966
00:27:59,930 --> 00:27:59,940
but I would say you know it's probably
 

967
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,830
but I would say you know it's probably
more to do with what you won't do versus

968
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
more to do with what you won't do versus
 

969
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
more to do with what you won't do versus
what you will do

970
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,130

 

971
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,270

as a practitioner you'll get further by

972
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,280
as a practitioner you'll get further by
 

973
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,850
as a practitioner you'll get further by
looking at what you won't do

974
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:14,860

 

975
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,000

I think that's probably why most of the

976
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,010
I think that's probably why most of the
 

977
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,580
I think that's probably why most of the
religions came up with what we moderns

978
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:20,590
religions came up with what we moderns
 

979
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,620
religions came up with what we moderns
look back as and look his rules an

980
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:24,630
look back as and look his rules an
 

981
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,740
look back as and look his rules an
oppression and why discipline gets this

982
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:28,750
oppression and why discipline gets this
 

983
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,910
oppression and why discipline gets this
bad name but I think

984
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:32,920

 

985
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,540

they were trying to look at what you

986
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:36,550
they were trying to look at what you
 

987
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:44,360
they were trying to look at what you
don't do is what counts

988
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,370

 

989
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,710

because

990
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
because
 

991
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,790
because
it lends itself towards consistency

992
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:51,800

 

993
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,140

absence of hypocrisy

994
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,150

 

995
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,870

I think that's also why you have many of

I think that's also why you have many of
 

997
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,540
I think that's also why you have many of
the ancient traditions really making a

the ancient traditions really making a
 

999

the ancient traditions really making a
problem out of hypocrisy

1000
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:08,770

 

1001
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,770

what what is that not what's going on

when you have one practice that's
 

1005
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,510
when you have one practice that's
supposed to be super meaningful but

1006
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
supposed to be super meaningful but
 

1007
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,750
supposed to be super meaningful but
you're just going through the motions

1008
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
you're just going through the motions
 

1009
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,570

I have to problematize them I have to

1022
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:42,549
I have to problematize them I have to
 

1023
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:45,360

1051
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,520

I think that's more doable than telling

1052
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:35,530
I think that's more doable than telling
 

1053

and I think we don't know how to use it
 

1131
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,580
and I think we don't know how to use it
anymore as a culture because we're

1132
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:45,590
anymore as a culture because we're
 

1133
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,250
anymore as a culture because we're
always taught focus on the positive

1134

1154
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:19,889
that if you look in the in the in the
 

1155
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:22,549
that if you look in the in the in the
spectrum of human history that's like

1156
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
spectrum of human history that's like
 

1157
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,769
spectrum of human history that's like
right right that's the very end like one

1158
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:27,779
right right that's the very end like one
 

1159
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:31,700
right right that's the very end like one
line where you had centuries of other

1160
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:31,710
line where you had centuries of other
 

1161
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,060
line where you had centuries of other
generations ago you know really can't be

1162
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,070
generations ago you know really can't be
 

1163
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,499
generations ago you know really can't be
that they didn't think of that is

1164
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:36,509
that they didn't think of that is
 

1165
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,490
that they didn't think of that is
probably it just doesn't work

1166
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:40,500

 

1167
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,660

probably doesn't work

1168
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:44,670

 

1169
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,030

maybe we're missing something when we

1170
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,040
maybe we're missing something when we
 

1171
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,990
maybe we're missing something when we
about the negative

1172
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,000

 

1173
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240

we're not understanding something

1174
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,250
we're not understanding something
 

1175
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,560
we're not understanding something
correctly about it and it might be the

1176
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:54,570
correctly about it and it might be the
 

1177
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,630
correctly about it and it might be the
teachers that are using it maybe they're

1178
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640
teachers that are using it maybe they're
 

1179
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,680
teachers that are using it maybe they're
using it incorrectly you see maybe our

1180
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:00,690
using it incorrectly you see maybe our
 

1181
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,990
using it incorrectly you see maybe our
problems with those teachers and not

1182
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,000
problems with those teachers and not
 

1183
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,110
problems with those teachers and not
necessarily with this technology

1184
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,120

 

1185
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360

so we're throwing the technology out

1186
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,370
so we're throwing the technology out
 

1187
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,490
so we're throwing the technology out
because the teacher sucked

1188
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:15,500

 

1189
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:24,680

many people do that

1190
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:24,690

 

1191
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,680

so I think when you come to your

1192
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:26,690
so I think when you come to your
 

1193
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,319
so I think when you come to your
training okay I don't think the ideals

1194
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:30,329
training okay I don't think the ideals
 

1195
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,270
training okay I don't think the ideals
are beyond any one of you you know

1196
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,280
are beyond any one of you you know
 

1197
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,950
are beyond any one of you you know
