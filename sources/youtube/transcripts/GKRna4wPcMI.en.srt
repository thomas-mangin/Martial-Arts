in kihon i would go like this i would
get off the line i would turn and be

28
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
get off the line i would turn and be
 

29
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,310

you do this you get off the line you
 

35
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,750
you do this you get off the line you
turn there

36
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
turn there
 

37
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,830

will say the energy

170
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
will say the energy
 

171
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,990
will say the energy
