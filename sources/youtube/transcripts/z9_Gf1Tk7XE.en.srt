00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000

 

41
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,670

so my hand never goes backwards

42
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680

 

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,990

my hand goes forward forward

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,830
my hand goes forward forward
and i'm not knocking him just wedging

46
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,749

him

48
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759

 

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,310

what you'll see different is my hands
 

51
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,950
what you'll see different is my hands
going backwards

52
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
going backwards
 

53
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,230
going backwards
then he bends back

54
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240

 

55
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,270

and then on the the smacking one he

56
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
and then on the the smacking one he
 

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,910
and then on the the smacking one he
stops poke he stops going forward

58
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
stops poke he stops going forward
 

59
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,830
stops poke he stops going forward

00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759

 

63
00:01:49,759 --> 00:02:06,830

really deep

64
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

65
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:21,589

up

66
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599

 

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,949
