00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,190

all right so some Mount stuff

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,200
all right so some Mount stuff
 

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,150
all right so some Mount stuff
okay cuz I've seen like you struggle

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
okay cuz I've seen like you struggle
 

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,150
okay cuz I've seen like you struggle
with this one a lot of times uh new

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,160
with this one a lot of times uh new
 

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,430
with this one a lot of times uh new
people like they they control by

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
people like they they control by
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,390
people like they they control by
squeezing right which is going to

10
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
squeezing right which is going to
 

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,310
squeezing right which is going to
fatigue you but if he's really squeezing

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
fatigue you but if he's really squeezing
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,269
fatigue you but if he's really squeezing
and you're trying to do elbow knee like

14
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:18,279
and you're trying to do elbow knee like
 

15
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,390
and you're trying to do elbow knee like
you're like that's it's not going to

16
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:19,400
you're like that's it's not going to
 

17
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,310
you're like that's it's not going to
work well that's cuz there's too much y

18
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,320
work well that's cuz there's too much y
 

19
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,189
work well that's cuz there's too much y
there you got to do something else okay

20
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:24,199
there you got to do something else okay
 

21
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,790
there you got to do something else okay
and another thing that will happen

22
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
and another thing that will happen
 

23
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,470
and another thing that will happen
because you're a good person the only

24
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,480
because you're a good person the only
 

25
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,950
because you're a good person the only
reason you're here is cuz you're being

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
reason you're here is cuz you're being
 

27
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,589
reason you're here is cuz you're being
assaulted okay and so this person is

28
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
assaulted okay and so this person is
 

29
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,030
assaulted okay and so this person is
trying to assault you they'll probably

30
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,040
trying to assault you they'll probably
 

31
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,869
trying to assault you they'll probably
posture up so they can punch drop elbows

32
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879
posture up so they can punch drop elbows
 

33
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,990
posture up so they can punch drop elbows
and what haveen okay also there's like

34
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
and what haveen okay also there's like
 

35
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,270
and what haveen okay also there's like
things that people do like you can make

36
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,280
things that people do like you can make
 

37
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,310
things that people do like you can make
him posture up so as as I'm coming

38
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:45,320
him posture up so as as I'm coming
 

39
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,389
him posture up so as as I'm coming
around here and I'm attacking his

40
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399
around here and I'm attacking his
 

41
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,069
around here and I'm attacking his
trachea and he starts to have energy

42
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
trachea and he starts to have energy
 

43
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,150
trachea and he starts to have energy
going up okay there's any number of

44
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
going up okay there's any number of
 

45
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,389
going up okay there's any number of
reasons but for this stuff uh to work

46
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
reasons but for this stuff uh to work
 

47
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,270
reasons but for this stuff uh to work
the Yang energy here is the squeezing

48
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
the Yang energy here is the squeezing
 

49
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,110
the Yang energy here is the squeezing
and he's up okay and you want to make

50
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,120
and he's up okay and you want to make
 

51
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,149
and he's up okay and you want to make
sure that he stays over your hips on

52
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
sure that he stays over your hips on
 

53
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,590
sure that he stays over your hips on
this one and again key there is that

54
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
this one and again key there is that
 

55
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,630
this one and again key there is that
your elbows are in front of his legs at

56
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
your elbows are in front of his legs at
 

57
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,230
your elbows are in front of his legs at
a young obstruction so here they're in

58
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,240
a young obstruction so here they're in
 

59
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,190
a young obstruction so here they're in
front of his legs but they're too high

60
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
front of his legs but they're too high
 

61
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,990
front of his legs but they're too high
on his leg they're up here and he can

62
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
on his leg they're up here and he can
 

63
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,550
on his leg they're up here and he can
still get a high mount and squeeze up

64
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
still get a high mount and squeeze up
 

65
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,270
still get a high mount and squeeze up
like that okay

66
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
like that okay
 

67
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,350
like that okay
so if he's down if he's up like some way

68
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
so if he's down if he's up like some way
 

69
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,510
so if he's down if he's up like some way
up there of course you can push him down

70
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,520
up there of course you can push him down
 

71
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,069
up there of course you can push him down
and but you have to make sure that you

72
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
and but you have to make sure that you
 

73
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,630
and but you have to make sure that you
do the following those elbows are in

74
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
do the following those elbows are in
 

75
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,350
do the following those elbows are in
some sort of young uh obstruction to him

76
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,360
some sort of young uh obstruction to him
 

77
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,469
some sort of young uh obstruction to him
okay I can't get my elbows down here

78
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:41,479
okay I can't get my elbows down here
 

79
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,230
okay I can't get my elbows down here
without being too vulnerable this isn't

80
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
without being too vulnerable this isn't
 

81
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,830
without being too vulnerable this isn't
doing anything for me but here I can

82
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:46,840
doing anything for me but here I can
 

83
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,670
doing anything for me but here I can
feel that I have enough Yong obstruction

84
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
feel that I have enough Yong obstruction
 

85
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,190
feel that I have enough Yong obstruction
so if he tries to go up he can't go up

86
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,200
so if he tries to go up he can't go up
 

87
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,870
so if he tries to go up he can't go up
with his knees okay and he's staying

88
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
with his knees okay and he's staying
 

89
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,910
with his knees okay and he's staying
down got it okay so arms are here and he

90
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
down got it okay so arms are here and he
 

91
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,789
down got it okay so arms are here and he
squeezing and we're just going to do the

92
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:01,799
squeezing and we're just going to do the
 

93
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,149
squeezing and we're just going to do the
following experiment yeah I can't get

94
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
following experiment yeah I can't get
 

95
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,710
following experiment yeah I can't get
elbow knee Escape but uh by simply

96
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
elbow knee Escape but uh by simply
 

97
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,430
elbow knee Escape but uh by simply
squeeze your legs by simply turning you

98
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
squeeze your legs by simply turning you
 

99
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,150
squeeze your legs by simply turning you
get a lot of uh kazushi going okay so

100
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,160
get a lot of uh kazushi going okay so
 

101
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,589
get a lot of uh kazushi going okay so
this is stage one just so you feel it

102
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
this is stage one just so you feel it
 

103
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,390
this is stage one just so you feel it
all all you're going to do is turn your

104
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400
all all you're going to do is turn your
 

105
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,910
all all you're going to do is turn your
hips over and you see how easy that is

106
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
hips over and you see how easy that is
 

107
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,630
hips over and you see how easy that is
where before someone squeezing is

108
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
where before someone squeezing is
 

109
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,270
where before someone squeezing is
causing a lot of hell for you okay so

110
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
causing a lot of hell for you okay so
 

111
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,270
causing a lot of hell for you okay so
he's there and you just turn your hips

112
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,280
he's there and you just turn your hips
 

113
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,030
he's there and you just turn your hips
okay that's phase

114
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040

 

115
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,990

one all right so in our uh basic

116
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
one all right so in our uh basic
 

117
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,630
one all right so in our uh basic
curriculum we we do that hip up one and

118
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
curriculum we we do that hip up one and
 

119
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,710
curriculum we we do that hip up one and
uh it's just to understand like it's

120
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
uh it's just to understand like it's
 

121
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,670
uh it's just to understand like it's
opening is when someone's wrapping

122
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:48,680
opening is when someone's wrapping
 

123
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,110
opening is when someone's wrapping
around you like that all tight okay so

124
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,120
around you like that all tight okay so
 

125
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,470
around you like that all tight okay so
uh we're going to do a variation on it

126
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
uh we're going to do a variation on it
 

127
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,190
uh we're going to do a variation on it
all right I'm going to go one hand so I

128
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
all right I'm going to go one hand so I
 

129
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,670
all right I'm going to go one hand so I
go one hand on that Center and I'm going

130
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
go one hand on that Center and I'm going
 

131
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,789
go one hand on that Center and I'm going
to

132
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:03,799
to
 

133
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,509
to
turn till he's over and now I can shrimp

134
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
turn till he's over and now I can shrimp
 

135
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,509
turn till he's over and now I can shrimp
out and pull my elbow out

00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519

 

137
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,789

okay so y contestation on the legs I

138
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:18,799
okay so y contestation on the legs I
 

139
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,949
okay so y contestation on the legs I
have anchored

140
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:19,959
have anchored
 

141
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,589
have anchored
elbows

142
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
elbows
 

143
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,589
elbows
one turn boom

144
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
one turn boom
 

145
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,070
one turn boom

shrimp pull my elbow out okay now
let's we're going to do that that's pH

148
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:32,680
let's we're going to do that that's pH
 

149
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,670
let's we're going to do that that's pH
two

150
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,680
two
 

151
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,710
two
okay um

152
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720

 

153
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,270

again

154
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
again
 

155
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,509
again
one

156
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,519
one
 

157
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,830
one
2 3 okay let's try

158
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840

 

159
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,869

that all right so right this is all

160
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:51,879
that all right so right this is all
 

161
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,149
that all right so right this is all
admin stuff so he's going up to punch me

162
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
admin stuff so he's going up to punch me
 

163
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,270
admin stuff so he's going up to punch me
