three movements
 

55
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,350
three movements
and i'll just go through them again

56
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360

61
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,830

now these are movements that uh

62
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
now these are movements that uh
 

63
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,789
now these are movements that uh
are breaking down and cytosensei in his

64
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
are breaking down and cytosensei in his
 

65
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,070
are breaking down and cytosensei in his
later years

66
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
later years
 

67
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,469
later years
he made us break them down and what he

68
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
he made us break them down and what he
 

69
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,469
he made us break them down and what he
would do is he would count them

70
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
would do is he would count them
 

71
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,510
would do is he would count them
like this

72
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520

 

73
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,230

itch knee

74
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
itch knee
 

75
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,990
itch knee
knee knee

76
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000

 

77
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,149

it's to make it so that it obviously

78
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
it's to make it so that it obviously
 

79
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,670
it's to make it so that it obviously
comes out

80
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
comes out
 

81
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,429
comes out
right he doesn't want you know it can't

82
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
right he doesn't want you know it can't
 

83
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,830
right he doesn't want you know it can't
be a 13 count carter

84
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
be a 13 count carter
 

85
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,870
be a 13 count carter
and in tai chi they call it 24

86
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
and in tai chi they call it 24
 

87
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,510
and in tai chi they call it 24
forms but it's got about 100 movements

88
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
forms but it's got about 100 movements
 

89
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,870
forms but it's got about 100 movements
in it

90
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
in it
 

91
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,830
in it
and so really him breaking it down he's

92
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
and so really him breaking it down he's
 

93
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,109
and so really him breaking it down he's
created it more

94
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
created it more
 

95
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,749
created it more
like within the tai chi there's a lot

96
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
like within the tai chi there's a lot
 

97
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,150
like within the tai chi there's a lot
more

98
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
more
 

99
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,390
more
so so what i'm showing here

100
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
so so what i'm showing here
 

101
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,830
so so what i'm showing here
is the broken down movements so itch

102
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

103
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:35,030

knee

104
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040

shoes

106
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480

 

107
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,390

okay so so we're going to end up with a

108
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
okay so so we're going to end up with a
 

109
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,710
okay so so we're going to end up with a
lot more than 13.

110
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
lot more than 13.
 

111
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,550
lot more than 13.
what i'm trying to do with these films

112
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
what i'm trying to do with these films
 

113
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,710
what i'm trying to do with these films
are i'm trying to break it down so that

114
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
are i'm trying to break it down so that
 

115
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,190
are i'm trying to break it down so that
you know

116
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
you know
 

117
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,229
you know
each section and how you should feel

118
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
each section and how you should feel
 

119
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,030
each section and how you should feel
how it should be the angles it should be

120
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
how it should be the angles it should be
 

121
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,790
how it should be the angles it should be
right so

122
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
right so
 

123
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,270
right so
there's one very important point that i

124
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
there's one very important point that i
 

125
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,390

139
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,750
now this is no good
you can't develop your coq and key

140
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
you can't develop your coq and key
 

141
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,910
you can't develop your coq and key
the key will not come out and be

142
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
the key will not come out and be
 

143
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,270
the key will not come out and be
released from you

144
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
released from you
 

145
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,350
released from you
because you're concentrating even though

146
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
because you're concentrating even though
 

147
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,550
because you're concentrating even though
you don't realize

148
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
you don't realize
 

149
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,830
you don't realize
you're concentrating on the counting

150
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
you're concentrating on the counting
 

151
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,149
you're concentrating on the counting
counting is destroying the build-up of

152
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
counting is destroying the build-up of
 

153
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,589
counting is destroying the build-up of
the coke here and the build

154
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
the coke here and the build
 

155
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,750
the coke here and the build
and the flow of the key

156
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760

 

157
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,789

so i recommend you study

158
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799

i

162
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439

 

163
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,470

so that's the first four movements now

164
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
