1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,860

your hand changes for a second and not

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:09,870
your hand changes for a second and not
 

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,330
your hand changes for a second and not
that and it's not some magic loop you do

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:14,340
that and it's not some magic loop you do
 

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,109
that and it's not some magic loop you do
that your hookahs arm stays out there

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
that your hookahs arm stays out there
 

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,700
that your hookahs arm stays out there
there there is energy working between

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,710
there there is energy working between
 

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,000
there there is energy working between
the two grips do you feel that okay not

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,010
the two grips do you feel that okay not
 

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,400
the two grips do you feel that okay not
not like that

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:27,410
not like that
 

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,679
not like that
it's where he gets stuck okay

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:30,689
it's where he gets stuck okay
 

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:38,360
it's where he gets stuck okay
and so this friction here is working

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,370
and so this friction here is working
 

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,030
and so this friction here is working
with this friction here and so this hand

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
with this friction here and so this hand
 

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,779
with this friction here and so this hand
can move you see but it's still keeping

20
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:44,789
can move you see but it's still keeping
 

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,810
can move you see but it's still keeping
it in place okay so you can still do

22
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
it in place okay so you can still do
 

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,369
it in place okay so you can still do
throws not it's dead here I'm holding it

24
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:55,379
throws not it's dead here I'm holding it
 

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,090
throws not it's dead here I'm holding it
is dead

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100
is dead
 

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,990
is dead
so energy between the two hands and you

28
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
so energy between the two hands and you
 

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,290
so energy between the two hands and you
can get that technically though okay so

30
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,300
can get that technically though okay so
 

31
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,390
can get that technically though okay so
don't let this hand go down

32
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
don't let this hand go down
 

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,990
don't let this hand go down
oh you should have this Center with

34
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
oh you should have this Center with
 

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,219
oh you should have this Center with
those two hats Center with those two

36
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:13,229
those two hats Center with those two
 

37
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:23,179
those two hats Center with those two
Napa so it looks like I'm letting go but

38
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:23,189
Napa so it looks like I'm letting go but
 

39
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,240
Napa so it looks like I'm letting go but
I'm not because I'm not grip dependent

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,250
I'm not because I'm not grip dependent
 

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm not because I'm not grip dependent
on the other technique its energy

42
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,150
on the other technique its energy
 

43
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,780
on the other technique its energy
dependent it's an energetic relationship

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,790
dependent it's an energetic relationship
 

45
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,539
dependent it's an energetic relationship
between the two hands his arm his

46
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:35,549
between the two hands his arm his
 

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,630
between the two hands his arm his
attention his inertia okay his

48
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
attention his inertia okay his
 

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,330
attention his inertia okay his
gravitational pull all that keeps that

50
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
gravitational pull all that keeps that
 

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,219
gravitational pull all that keeps that
hand there he's he's not holding it

52
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:46,229
hand there he's he's not holding it
 

53
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,480
hand there he's he's not holding it
there for me or me molded in there

54
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:49,490
there for me or me molded in there
 

55
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,080
there for me or me molded in there
for for me okay energy is what's holding

56
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,090
for for me okay energy is what's holding
 

57
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,620
for for me okay energy is what's holding
it there okay got it

58
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,630

 

59
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,960

so these these techniques when I come

60
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:01,970
so these these techniques when I come
 

61
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,420
so these these techniques when I come
around is how you can do disarm so we're

62
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,430
around is how you can do disarm so we're
 

63
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:14,050
around is how you can do disarm so we're
gonna work it that way here okay it's

64
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,060
gonna work it that way here okay it's
 

65
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,370
gonna work it that way here okay it's
not me going like that okay boom here I

66
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:18,380
not me going like that okay boom here I
 

67
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:30,150
not me going like that okay boom here I
get the energy I'll come around here

68
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
get the energy I'll come around here
 

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,979
get the energy I'll come around here
around I'm not doing anything I'm just

70
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:32,989
around I'm not doing anything I'm just
 

71
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:45,930
around I'm not doing anything I'm just
around I find the opening here boom

72
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:45,940

 

73
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,229

okay boom Kitty grip boom come

74
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
okay boom Kitty grip boom come
 

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,140
okay boom Kitty grip boom come
underneath over the top home energy in

76
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,150
underneath over the top home energy in
 

77
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,930
underneath over the top home energy in
here energy energy still energy that

78
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:58,940
here energy energy still energy that
 

79
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,759
here energy energy still energy that
nice gonna make me not want to let go

80
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:00,769
nice gonna make me not want to let go
 

81
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:14,770
nice gonna make me not want to let go
you see energy energy energy energy okay

82
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:14,780
you see energy energy energy energy okay
 

83
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:28,360
you see energy energy energy energy okay
let's try this this is that energies for

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,370
let's try this this is that energies for
 

85
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,800
let's try this this is that energies for
the disarm one so if you let it go this

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:35,810
the disarm one so if you let it go this
 

87
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,119
the disarm one so if you let it go this
hand is feeding that energy you see that

88
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:39,129
hand is feeding that energy you see that
 

89
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,910
hand is feeding that energy you see that
okay so it's feeding it I don't mean to

90
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:42,920
okay so it's feeding it I don't mean to
 

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,580
okay so it's feeding it I don't mean to
grab it it's feeding me this hand is

92
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,590
grab it it's feeding me this hand is
 

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,699
grab it it's feeding me this hand is
feeding the elbow hand do you see do you

94
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:48,709
feeding the elbow hand do you see do you
 

95
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,190
feeding the elbow hand do you see do you
feel that yeah I'm gonna take one energy

96
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
feel that yeah I'm gonna take one energy
 

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
feel that yeah I'm gonna take one energy
off see the difference not as tight

98
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:53,930
off see the difference not as tight
 

99
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,160
off see the difference not as tight
right elbow hun is off the energy I'm

100
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,170
right elbow hun is off the energy I'm
 

101
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,289
right elbow hun is off the energy I'm
gonna put the energy on and it goes into

102
00:03:59,289 --> 00:03:59,299
gonna put the energy on and it goes into
 

103
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,599
gonna put the energy on and it goes into
your Center do you feel that I'm using

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:01,609
your Center do you feel that I'm using
 

105
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,750
your Center do you feel that I'm using
his Center to generate friction into two

106
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:04,760
his Center to generate friction into two
 

107
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,229
his Center to generate friction into two
hands you see that you feel that okay so

108
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
hands you see that you feel that okay so
 

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,330
hands you see that you feel that okay so
when I come around you're gonna lose all

110
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,340
when I come around you're gonna lose all
 

111
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,400
when I come around you're gonna lose all
that if you let that whole thing go down

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,410
that if you let that whole thing go down
 

113
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,680
that if you let that whole thing go down
you so you're going to move into that

114
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,690
you so you're going to move into that
 

115
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,289
you so you're going to move into that
whole thing it's still the same thing

116
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:17,299
whole thing it's still the same thing
 

117
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,409
whole thing it's still the same thing
you feel it okay it's still the same

118
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:20,419
you feel it okay it's still the same
 

119
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:26,409
you feel it okay it's still the same
thing full again so everything is in

120
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:26,419
thing full again so everything is in
 

121
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,129
thing full again so everything is in
place boom is still there it doesn't

122
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:30,139
place boom is still there it doesn't
 

123
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,900
place boom is still there it doesn't
matter what I'm touching with it we're

124
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:31,910
matter what I'm touching with it we're
 

125
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,790
matter what I'm touching with it we're
how I'm touching with it it's all the

126
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:33,800
how I'm touching with it it's all the
 

127
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,010
how I'm touching with it it's all the
same okay try it again so remember it's

128
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,020
same okay try it again so remember it's
 

129
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,510
same okay try it again so remember it's
three points

130
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,520
three points
 

131
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,760
three points
the two hats must be pulling on the

132
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:42,770
the two hats must be pulling on the
 

133
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,760
the two hats must be pulling on the
center that's why you have the Kazushi -

134
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:45,770
center that's why you have the Kazushi -
 

135
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,510
center that's why you have the Kazushi -
okay so I'm not going to go like this

136
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
okay so I'm not going to go like this
 

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,879
okay so I'm not going to go like this
he kept keeps his hand there for me

138
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:51,889
he kept keeps his hand there for me
 

139
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,260
he kept keeps his hand there for me
right he's gonna be goofy so I'm gonna

140
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,270
right he's gonna be goofy so I'm gonna
 

141
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,450
right he's gonna be goofy so I'm gonna
go to trial I'm gonna go slow as they

142
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,460
go to trial I'm gonna go slow as they
 

143
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,159
go to trial I'm gonna go slow as they
keep moving right so he's trying to get

144
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:00,169
keep moving right so he's trying to get
 

145
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,839
keep moving right so he's trying to get
up and I'm gonna take this

146
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:01,849
up and I'm gonna take this
 

147
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,170
up and I'm gonna take this
reconciliation this way do you see how

148
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,180
reconciliation this way do you see how
 

149
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,600
reconciliation this way do you see how
did not but it's the same kind of thing

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,610
did not but it's the same kind of thing
 

151
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,080
did not but it's the same kind of thing
it's not me holding this or him holding

152
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,090
it's not me holding this or him holding
 

153
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,870
it's not me holding this or him holding
his arm up and I get to do that kinda if

154
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:13,880
his arm up and I get to do that kinda if
 

155
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,770
his arm up and I get to do that kinda if
the friction is already there can you

156
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:17,780
the friction is already there can you
 

157
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,370
the friction is already there can you
see that

158
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,380
see that
 

159
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,559
see that
so don't go dead here no it's pulling on

160
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:23,569
so don't go dead here no it's pulling on
 

161
