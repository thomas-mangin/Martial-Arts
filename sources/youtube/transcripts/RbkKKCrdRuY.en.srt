the closer
by turning this back foot in a bit more

26
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,420
by turning this back foot in a bit more
 

27
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,670
by turning this back foot in a bit more
watch this

28
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
watch this
 

29
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,690

it turns my hips over there Square

30
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:44,700
it turns my hips over there Square
 

31
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,150
it turns my hips over there Square
so

32
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
so
 

33
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,310
so

34
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,320
there's a tie dip so I'm a little more
 

35
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,510
there's a tie dip so I'm a little more
open

36
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
open
 

37
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,110
open
this way to my ride in this case

38
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,120
this way to my ride in this case
 

39
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,590
this way to my ride in this case
and but turning in it brings the hips

40
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
and but turning in it brings the hips
 

41
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,130
and but turning in it brings the hips
more even more Square not quite

42
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,140
more even more Square not quite
 

43
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,030
more even more Square not quite
it's going to twist but more Square

44
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,040
it's going to twist but more Square
 

45
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,810
it's going to twist but more Square
and it will start like you know or you

46
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:11,820
and it will start like you know or you
 

47
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,990
and it will start like you know or you
say use the hips but we use the hips in

48
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
say use the hips but we use the hips in
 

49
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,789
say use the hips but we use the hips in
a tipping manner

50
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
a tipping manner
 

51
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,050
a tipping manner
in a pelvic tip so when we cast we do a

52
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,060
in a pelvic tip so when we cast we do a
 

53
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,830
in a pelvic tip so when we cast we do a
pelvic tip

54
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

55
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,289

we know the pelvic tip

56
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,299
we know the pelvic tip
 

57
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,370
we know the pelvic tip
however tip we don't turn

58
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380
however tip we don't turn
 

59
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,050
however tip we don't turn
this way

60
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,060
this way
 

61
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,530
this way
we don't turn

62
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:36,540

 

63
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,010

that's right

64
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,020

 

65
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,469

so a lot of people get this confused

66
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
so a lot of people get this confused
 

67
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,590
so a lot of people get this confused
because when they think that they have

68
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
because when they think that they have
 

69
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,850
because when they think that they have
to cut

70
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:46,860
to cut
 

71
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,969
to cut
and perhaps hear that they've got the

72
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:49,979
and perhaps hear that they've got the
 

73
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,910
and perhaps hear that they've got the
candles and straight and when they come

74
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:52,920
candles and straight and when they come
 

75
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,550
candles and straight and when they come
down they're cutting forward and you

76
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
down they're cutting forward and you
 

77
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,770
down they're cutting forward and you
actually watch my hips my hips are

78
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:57,780
actually watch my hips my hips are
 

79
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,990
actually watch my hips my hips are
turning away from me and turning this

80
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
turning away from me and turning this
 

81
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,510
turning away from me and turning this
way so you get this

82
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
way so you get this
 

83
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,910
way so you get this
worship

84
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920
worship
 

85
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,730
worship
okay and this is

86
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:07,740
okay and this is
 

87
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,410
okay and this is
two

88
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:09,420
two
 

89
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,750
two
planes

90
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
planes
 

91
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,850
planes
going

92
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
going
 

93
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,330
going
in two different directions

94
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:16,340
in two different directions
 

95
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,210
in two different directions
so two planes going in

96
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,220
so two planes going in
 

97
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,390
so two planes going in
two different directions so your hips

98
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,400
two different directions so your hips
 

99
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,050
two different directions so your hips
are going stuck on a flat line

100
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,060
are going stuck on a flat line
 

101
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,990
are going stuck on a flat line
and your cup is going outwards on a

102
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
and your cup is going outwards on a
 

103
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,010
and your cup is going outwards on a
straight

104
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,020
straight
 

105
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,430
straight
plan

106
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440

 

107
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,890

if you take the Ken from the Sun and you

108
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:39,900
if you take the Ken from the Sun and you
 

109
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,490
if you take the Ken from the Sun and you
always take the blade facing towards you

110
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:43,500
always take the blade facing towards you
 

111
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,390
always take the blade facing towards you
you take it evenly within the spice and

112
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,400
you take it evenly within the spice and
 

113
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,330
you take it evenly within the spice and
if somebody hands it to you so I'm going
