00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,950

all right

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:01,960
all right
 

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,950
all right
um again I think Adam should chime in on

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:04,960
um again I think Adam should chime in on
 

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,150
um again I think Adam should chime in on
this because he could feel how hard

6
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,160
this because he could feel how hard
 

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,509
this because he could feel how hard
we're actually

8
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:08,519
we're actually
 

9
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,509
we're actually
pushing and in the cou cultivation set

10
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
pushing and in the cou cultivation set
 

11
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,390
pushing and in the cou cultivation set
and we took him past failures we do that

12
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
and we took him past failures we do that
 

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,029
and we took him past failures we do that
sometimes but sometimes we do dial it

14
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:18,039
sometimes but sometimes we do dial it
 

15
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,310
sometimes but sometimes we do dial it
back but you have to be careful that

16
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
back but you have to be careful that
 

17
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,830
back but you have to be careful that
you're dialing it back to

18
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
you're dialing it back to
 

19
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,710
you're dialing it back to
your current state says that you're only

20
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
your current state says that you're only
 

21
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,470
your current state says that you're only
supporting your current state and not

22
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
supporting your current state and not
 

23
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,269
supporting your current state and not
the transformation from your current

24
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,279
the transformation from your current
 

25
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,389
the transformation from your current
State you have to go to past failure

26
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:33,399
State you have to go to past failure
 

27
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,270
State you have to go to past failure
Point okay um at least occasionally some

28
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
Point okay um at least occasionally some
 

29
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,869
Point okay um at least occasionally some
people say like you know 10 they try to

30
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:39,879
people say like you know 10 they try to
 

31
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,670
people say like you know 10 they try to
give it a percentage time 10 10 15 20%

32
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
give it a percentage time 10 10 15 20%
 

33
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,110
give it a percentage time 10 10 15 20%
failure rate uh is what you want in your

34
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
failure rate uh is what you want in your
 

35
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,990
failure rate uh is what you want in your
training um I don't think that the the

36
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
training um I don't think that the the
 

37
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,590
training um I don't think that the the
main part is that you're not lying to

38
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
main part is that you're not lying to
 

39
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,670
main part is that you're not lying to
yourself by manipulating your training

40
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,680
yourself by manipulating your training
 

41
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,430
yourself by manipulating your training
environment to not expose uh where your

42
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
environment to not expose uh where your
 

43
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,670
environment to not expose uh where your
limits are to you that's the main point

44
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
limits are to you that's the main point
 

45
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,590
limits are to you that's the main point
okay

46
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
okay
 

47
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,990
okay
so

48
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000
so
 

49
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,390
so
um when we do

50
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
um when we do
 

51
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,830
um when we do
the C set and like we're

52
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
the C set and like we're
 

53
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,429
the C set and like we're
pushing um sometimes we I you'll see my

54
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:14,439
pushing um sometimes we I you'll see my
 

55
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,149
pushing um sometimes we I you'll see my
Desi where you can't really tell except

56
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,159
Desi where you can't really tell except
 

57
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,870
Desi where you can't really tell except
for who's grabbing who's doing the

58
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
for who's grabbing who's doing the
 

59
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,990
for who's grabbing who's doing the
grounding drill and that's cuz they're

60
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
grounding drill and that's cuz they're
 

61
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,870
grounding drill and that's cuz they're
at that at that level okay um but when

62
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:25,880
at that at that level okay um but when
 

63
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,630
at that at that level okay um but when
they first started I I want them to to

64
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
they first started I I want them to to
 

65
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,270
they first started I I want them to to
Really Drive really drive and I'd let

66
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Really Drive really drive and I'd let
 

67
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,350
Really Drive really drive and I'd let
him drive and I'd have like two or three

68
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
him drive and I'd have like two or three
 

69
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,190
him drive and I'd have like two or three
people trying to push so they would

70
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,200
people trying to push so they would
 

71
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,990
people trying to push so they would
know

72
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
know
 

73
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,350
know
um where what they're doing and what

74
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,360
um where what they're doing and what
 

75
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,109
um where what they're doing and what
they're not doing okay so if Virginia if

76
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
they're not doing okay so if Virginia if
 

77
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,389
they're not doing okay so if Virginia if
I have a bracing angle for example like

78
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
I have a bracing angle for example like
 

79
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,870
I have a bracing angle for example like
A-frame bracing angle you you can use

80
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:49,880
A-frame bracing angle you you can use
 

81
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,550
A-frame bracing angle you you can use
two hands right I'm stronger than her

82
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
two hands right I'm stronger than her
 

83
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,230
two hands right I'm stronger than her
she's not she's not going to push that

84
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
she's not she's not going to push that
 

85
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,230
she's not she's not going to push that
over okay um but when I put you in Han

86
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
over okay um but when I put you in Han
 

87
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,149
over okay um but when I put you in Han
me and I don't have that angle and she's

88
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
me and I don't have that angle and she's
 

89
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,069
me and I don't have that angle and she's
she's

90
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079
she's
 

91
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,990
she's
driving I don't want to see that but I

92
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
driving I don't want to see that but I
 

93
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,430
driving I don't want to see that but I
need to see

94
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:07,440
need to see
 

95
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,869
need to see
that I don't want her to just push so I

96
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:11,879
that I don't want her to just push so I
 

97
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,589
that I don't want her to just push so I
so I can stand there she she has to be

98
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
so I can stand there she she has to be
 

99
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,949
so I can stand there she she has to be
able to push push push push push push

100
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
able to push push push push push push
 

101
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,630
able to push push push push push push
and I have to be able to stay in

102
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:21,640
and I have to be able to stay in
 

103
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,030
and I have to be able to stay in
position without needing that bracing

104
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040
position without needing that bracing
 

105
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,750
position without needing that bracing
angle okay and so again this is where

106
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
angle okay and so again this is where
 

107
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,509
angle okay and so again this is where
Adam could talk because his tire his

108
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:29,519
Adam could talk because his tire his
 

109
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,030
Adam could talk because his tire his
tire like he's tiring on the UK he's

110
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
tire like he's tiring on the UK he's
 

111
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,710
tire like he's tiring on the UK he's
like can't do it okay but you need to

112
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
like can't do it okay but you need to
 

113
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,710
like can't do it okay but you need to
have your UK push like that okay um and

114
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
have your UK push like that okay um and
 

115
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,070
have your UK push like that okay um and
then

116
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
then
 

117
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,670
then
also when we do the the projection part

118
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:44,680
also when we do the the projection part
 

119
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,990
also when we do the the projection part
so we do the projection part it's not

120
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
so we do the projection part it's not
 

121
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,390
so we do the projection part it's not
that she stops pushing she's still

122
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
that she stops pushing she's still
 

123
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,149
that she stops pushing she's still
driving so as I go back she's still

124
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,159
driving so as I go back she's still
 

125
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,790
driving so as I go back she's still
pushing just as hard she's pushing just

126
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:55,800
pushing just as hard she's pushing just
 

127
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,390
pushing just as hard she's pushing just
as hard and I still have to go

128
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
as hard and I still have to go
 

129
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,949
as hard and I still have to go
forward it's not

130
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
forward it's not
 

131
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,110
forward it's not
that they start pushing she goes back

132
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
that they start pushing she goes back
 

133
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,710
that they start pushing she goes back
and now I stop pushing do you see and

134
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
and now I stop pushing do you see and
 

135
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,350
and now I stop pushing do you see and
now she comes forward and then pushes so

136
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
now she comes forward and then pushes so
 

137
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,630
now she comes forward and then pushes so
I have

138
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:11,640
I have
 

139
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,229
I have
to push she goes back I'm still pushing

140
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,239
to push she goes back I'm still pushing
 

141
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,190
to push she goes back I'm still pushing
she has to come forward against that

142
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,200
she has to come forward against that
 

143
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,149
she has to come forward against that
still pushing okay um that said when we

144
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
still pushing okay um that said when we
 

145
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,149
still pushing okay um that said when we
do when I I get when they get to a point

146
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:27,159
do when I I get when they get to a point
 

147
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,390
do when I I get when they get to a point
where both parties are grounding I

148
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
where both parties are grounding I
 

149
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,589
where both parties are grounding I
it is not the case that they're not

150
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:32,599
it is not the case that they're not
 

151
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,710
it is not the case that they're not
pushing they're actually more efficient

152
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
pushing they're actually more efficient
 

153
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,270
pushing they're actually more efficient
so if if I'm here and I do this bracing

154
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
so if if I'm here and I do this bracing
 

155
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,830
so if if I'm here and I do this bracing
angle she's going going going she's

156
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
angle she's going going going she's
 

157
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,429
angle she's going going going she's
pretty good but once I once I used the

158
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:45,439
pretty good but once I once I used the
 

159
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,470
pretty good but once I once I used the
ground she not it's not good at all so

160
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
ground she not it's not good at all so
 

161
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,149
ground she not it's not good at all so
that's a higher push even though on

162
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:51,159
