9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,829
complement it
and it's going to take a long time and a

10
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
and it's going to take a long time and a
 

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,230
and it's going to take a long time and a
lot of explanation

12
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
lot of explanation
 

13
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,710

you know we're in the

18
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,000

 

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,429

2025 say

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
2025 say
 

21
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,109
2025 say
where

22
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
where
 

23
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,270
where
we've got electric cars hydrogen cars

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
we've got electric cars hydrogen cars
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,030
we've got electric cars hydrogen cars
and fuel cars

26
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
and fuel cars
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,950
and fuel cars
we'll call it gas

28
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
we'll call it gas
 

29
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,110
we'll call it gas
because diesel petrol

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120

 

31
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,150

now you may be thinking electric's the

32
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
now you may be thinking electric's the
 

33
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,990
now you may be thinking electric's the
future but

34
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
future but
 

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,869
future but
who knows in

36
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:49,879
who knows in
 

37
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,830
who knows in
2025 they may have made some

38
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
2025 they may have made some
 

39
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
2025 they may have made some
breakthroughs there might be another

40
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
breakthroughs there might be another
 

41
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,590
breakthroughs there might be another
form of

42
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
form of
 

43
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,709
form of
fuel

44
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719

 

45
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,069

coke you

46
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
coke you
 

47
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,750
coke you
and key

48
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
and key
 

49
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,950
and key
i've had in my body now for more than 20

50
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
i've had in my body now for more than 20
 

51
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,910
i've had in my body now for more than 20
years

52
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920

 

53
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,310

so why am i talking about cars

54
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320

 

55
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,870

it's the same as

56
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
it's the same as
 

57
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,070
it's the same as
when we train aikido

58
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
when we train aikido
 

59
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,990
when we train aikido
we're thinking about a martial art we

60
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
we're thinking about a martial art we
 

61
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,789
we're thinking about a martial art we
start we train and then as the years go

62
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
start we train and then as the years go
 

63
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,950
start we train and then as the years go
by we keep doing it

64
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
by we keep doing it
 

65
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,950
by we keep doing it
and we perhaps get a better car

66
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
and we perhaps get a better car
 

67
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,109
and we perhaps get a better car
something a little bit you know better

68
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
something a little bit you know better
 

69
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,310
something a little bit you know better
than the first car we ever had

70
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
than the first car we ever had
 

71
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,590
than the first car we ever had
but they all run on fuel

72
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
but they all run on fuel
 

73
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,630
but they all run on fuel
so

74
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
so
 

75
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,310
so
starting the book with tana hanker to me

76
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
starting the book with tana hanker to me
 

77
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,510

83
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,510
cytosensei
very methodical

84
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
very methodical
 

85
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,670
very methodical
but very powerful

86
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

anger in his techniques
 

93
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,590
anger in his techniques
but the power that comes from him or

94
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
but the power that comes from him or
 

95
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,590
but the power that comes from him or
came from him

96
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600

came from him
was

98
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
was
 

99
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,229
was
frightening because you didn't know how

103
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,949

even taking gudukemi it's still a

104
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
even taking gudukemi it's still a
 

105
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,270
even taking gudukemi it's still a
devastating amount of power

106
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
devastating amount of power
 

107
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,430
devastating amount of power
to handle

108
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
to handle
 

109
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,710

let's say i've got a gas car
 

119
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,430
let's say i've got a gas car
and the fuel gauge isn't working

120

the fuel cap down the fuel pipe and i
 

139
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,869
the fuel cap down the fuel pipe and i
can put it in pull it out

but i'm not sure
 

157
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,350
but i'm not sure
because my gauge doesn't tell me

158
