00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,380
addo key so hadou key is our
disentanglement methods how do we stop

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:21,390
disentanglement methods how do we stop
 

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,029
disentanglement methods how do we stop
someone from holding us it's important

12
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
someone from holding us it's important
 

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,550
someone from holding us it's important
to understand that in Hadopi we're not

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560
to understand that in Hadopi we're not
 

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,109
to understand that in Hadopi we're not
trying to grapple with anyone I don't

16
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
trying to grapple with anyone I don't
 

17
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,000
trying to grapple with anyone I don't
want to grapple with someone I just want

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,010
want to grapple with someone I just want
 

19
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,529
want to grapple with someone I just want
them to not be able to grapple with me

20
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:30,539
them to not be able to grapple with me
 

21
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,179
them to not be able to grapple with me
so I'm just trying to clear them off of

22
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,189
so I'm just trying to clear them off of
 

23
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,900
so I'm just trying to clear them off of
me

24
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:32,910
me
 

25
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,729

in Aikido the idea is the other person

26
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:34,739
in Aikido the idea is the other person
 

27
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:35,690
in Aikido the idea is the other person
is always bigger stronger faster

28
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,700
is always bigger stronger faster
 

29
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,490
is always bigger stronger faster
whatever than us so they have a lot more

30
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
whatever than us so they have a lot more
 

31
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,200
whatever than us so they have a lot more
ability than we do and that could also

32
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,210
ability than we do and that could also
 

33
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,729
ability than we do and that could also
come from skill maybe they're just more

34
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:40,739
come from skill maybe they're just more
 

35
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,830
come from skill maybe they're just more
skilled grapplers than we are so instead

36
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
skilled grapplers than we are so instead
 

37
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,970
skilled grapplers than we are so instead
of investing a whole lot of time and

38
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:43,980
of investing a whole lot of time and
 

39
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,250
of investing a whole lot of time and
getting better at grappling in Aikido we

40
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,260
getting better at grappling in Aikido we
 

41
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,270
getting better at grappling in Aikido we
have the Hadouken

42
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
have the Hadouken
 

43
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,220
have the Hadouken
which gets us out of that range ideally

44
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,230
which gets us out of that range ideally
 

45
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,350
which gets us out of that range ideally
now if that didn't work out for you you

46
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
now if that didn't work out for you you
 

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,510
now if that didn't work out for you you
do need to understand jujitsu so just

48
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
do need to understand jujitsu so just
 

49
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,340
do need to understand jujitsu so just
use a valuable skill but if we could

50
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,350
use a valuable skill but if we could
 

51
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,170
use a valuable skill but if we could
solve the problem before it ever got to

52
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,180
solve the problem before it ever got to
 

53
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,450
solve the problem before it ever got to
jujitsu in Aikido that's ideally what we

54
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,460
jujitsu in Aikido that's ideally what we
 

55
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,099
jujitsu in Aikido that's ideally what we
would like to have going for us so the

56
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:01,109
would like to have going for us so the
 

57
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,979
would like to have going for us so the
Hadopi are clearing methods last week we

58
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:03,989
Hadopi are clearing methods last week we
 

59
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,179
Hadopi are clearing methods last week we
worked on cop the door we talked about

60
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:05,189
worked on cop the door we talked about
 

61
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,710
worked on cop the door we talked about
the basic fundamentals of vetters

62
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
the basic fundamentals of vetters
 

63
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,719
the basic fundamentals of vetters
yesterday we talked about cop the dory

64
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:08,729
yesterday we talked about cop the dory
 

65
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,399
yesterday we talked about cop the dory
and the basic fundamentals of that this

66
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:10,409
and the basic fundamentals of that this
 

67
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,660
and the basic fundamentals of that this
week we're going to talk about real cop

68
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,670
week we're going to talk about real cop
 

69
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,190
week we're going to talk about real cop
the dory and who shiro a real cop that

70
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
the dory and who shiro a real cop that
 

71
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,719
the dory and who shiro a real cop that
already so if they have both shoulders

72
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:14,729
already so if they have both shoulders
 

73
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,730
already so if they have both shoulders
and a lot of the same techniques will

74
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:16,740
and a lot of the same techniques will
 

75
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,230
and a lot of the same techniques will
work as from cop the dory but we have a

76
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
work as from cop the dory but we have a
 

77
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,490
work as from cop the dory but we have a
couple of the things we need to account

78
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,500
couple of the things we need to account
 

79
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,080
couple of the things we need to account
for so I'm gonna call Josh over here

80
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,090
for so I'm gonna call Josh over here
 

81
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,289
for so I'm gonna call Josh over here
we're gonna go to work for you guys Josh

82
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:23,299
we're gonna go to work for you guys Josh
 

83
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,149
we're gonna go to work for you guys Josh
all right so we talked to yesterday

84
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
all right so we talked to yesterday
 

85
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,130
all right so we talked to yesterday
about Commodore II today we're gonna

86
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,140
about Commodore II today we're gonna
 

87
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,749
about Commodore II today we're gonna
talk about real cop the dory and a shear

88
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
talk about real cop the dory and a shear
 

89
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,560
talk about real cop the dory and a shear
real cut the dory

90
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,570
real cut the dory
 

91
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,630
real cut the dory
understand for the most part a lot of

92
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
understand for the most part a lot of
 

93
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,569
understand for the most part a lot of
the things we do in pop the door will

94
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:35,579
the things we do in pop the door will
 

95
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,300
the things we do in pop the door will
kind of work out for us in a real cop

96
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,310
kind of work out for us in a real cop
 

97
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,550
kind of work out for us in a real cop
the dory but we shouldn't have caught

98
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
the dory but we shouldn't have caught
 

99
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,630
the dory but we shouldn't have caught
that array and caught the during have

100
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
that array and caught the during have
 

101
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,749
that array and caught the during have
some other kind of things we can exploit

102
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
some other kind of things we can exploit
 

103
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,160
some other kind of things we can exploit
mainly ways that we can bind those two

104
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,170
mainly ways that we can bind those two
 

105
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,499
mainly ways that we can bind those two
arms together so it's the basic Gigi

106
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:48,509
arms together so it's the basic Gigi
 

107
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,060
arms together so it's the basic Gigi
principle where we're binding arms

108
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,070
principle where we're binding arms
 

109
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,510
principle where we're binding arms
together

110
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,520
together
 

111
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,429
together
so if Josh were to grab me real

112
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:52,439
so if Josh were to grab me real
 

113
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,069
so if Josh were to grab me real
glory a lot of times I could still get a

114
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
glory a lot of times I could still get a
 

115
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,950
glory a lot of times I could still get a
triangle just like normal so

116
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
triangle just like normal so
 

117
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,140
triangle just like normal so
here and you get a triangle the emphasis

118
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,150
here and you get a triangle the emphasis
 

119
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,789
here and you get a triangle the emphasis
has to be that I have to put a little

120
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
has to be that I have to put a little
 

121
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,649
has to be that I have to put a little
more pressure in this with my arm coming

122
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:02,659
more pressure in this with my arm coming
 

123
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,750
more pressure in this with my arm coming
up so if I just did a regular triangle

124
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:04,760
up so if I just did a regular triangle
 

125
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,730
up so if I just did a regular triangle
here this little clear real easy I just

126
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:06,740
here this little clear real easy I just
 

127
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,810
here this little clear real easy I just
let me go to the other side so they can

128
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:07,820
let me go to the other side so they can
 

129
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,699
let me go to the other side so they can
see so I come out here this one will

130
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:09,709
see so I come out here this one will
 

131
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,320
see so I come out here this one will
clear really easy but this one I kind of

132
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,330
clear really easy but this one I kind of
 

133
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,760
clear really easy but this one I kind of
have to do a little extra work to pop it

134
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:12,770
have to do a little extra work to pop it
 

135
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,500
have to do a little extra work to pop it
off but when I'm working that if I come

136
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,510
off but when I'm working that if I come
 

137
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,360
off but when I'm working that if I come
up and I kind of pop that up I'll get a

138
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,370
up and I kind of pop that up I'll get a
 

139
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,580
up and I kind of pop that up I'll get a
boat so I can use a triangle just 74

140
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:18,590
boat so I can use a triangle just 74
 

141
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,680
boat so I can use a triangle just 74
would you worry will work and if you

142
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:20,690
would you worry will work and if you
 

143
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,600
would you worry will work and if you
want to work really really nicely so

144
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,610
want to work really really nicely so
 

145
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,940
want to work really really nicely so
maybe if I roll under this here like

146
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:24,950
maybe if I roll under this here like
 

147
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,680
maybe if I roll under this here like
this I'll start putting his arms

148
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,690
this I'll start putting his arms
 

149
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,930
this I'll start putting his arms
together there to bind them and pop free

150
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:28,940
together there to bind them and pop free
 

151
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,000
together there to bind them and pop free
so as I'm coming around get those arms

152
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,010
so as I'm coming around get those arms
 

153
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,199
so as I'm coming around get those arms
working together and that's basically

154
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,209
working together and that's basically
 

155
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,910
working together and that's basically
the jutsu principle now when you're

156
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
the jutsu principle now when you're
 

157
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,979
the jutsu principle now when you're
going underneath you have to be careful

158
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:35,989
going underneath you have to be careful
 

159
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,810
going underneath you have to be careful
that that foot can be coming up now

160
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:37,820
that that foot can be coming up now
 

161
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,540
that that foot can be coming up now

Septim that's never gonna happen I'm
running and he managed to get this so

172
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:48,890
running and he managed to get this so
 

173
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,740
running and he managed to get this so
his feet are probably moving fast but

174
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:50,750
his feet are probably moving fast but
 

175
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,449
his feet are probably moving fast but
nonetheless I don't want to stick my

176
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:52,459
nonetheless I don't want to stick my
 

177
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,640
nonetheless I don't want to stick my
face down here because he can he can

178
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:54,650
face down here because he can he can
 

179
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,009
face down here because he can he can
bring that hand up so my arms trail out

180
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:57,019
bring that hand up so my arms trail out
 

181
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,270
bring that hand up so my arms trail out
here in front of me like this

182
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
here in front of me like this
 

183
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,520
here in front of me like this
so if the knee does come up at least it

184
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,530
so if the knee does come up at least it
 

185
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,259
so if the knee does come up at least it
hopefully gets deflected a little bit as

186
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:02,269
hopefully gets deflected a little bit as
 

187
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,000
hopefully gets deflected a little bit as
I'm coming through so won't my head to

188
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,010
I'm coming through so won't my head to
 

189
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,319
I'm coming through so won't my head to
be in through my hands and then I'm

190
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,329
be in through my hands and then I'm
 

191
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,910
be in through my hands and then I'm
diving through them binding those arms

192
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
diving through them binding those arms
 

193
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,190
diving through them binding those arms
together now we're looking at how those

194
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
together now we're looking at how those
 

195
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,710
together now we're looking at how those
arms are getting bound together here

196
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
arms are getting bound together here
 

197
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,960
arms are getting bound together here
like this so if you watch Josh's arms

198
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:13,970
like this so if you watch Josh's arms
 

199
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,130
like this so if you watch Josh's arms
right here actually should have moved to

200
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,140
right here actually should have moved to
 

201
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,660
right here actually should have moved to
the other direction sir I'm trying to

202
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,670
the other direction sir I'm trying to
 

203
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,830
the other direction sir I'm trying to
get those arms together like this and

204
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
get those arms together like this and
 

205
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,690
get those arms together like this and
I'm working them one against the other

206
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:19,700
I'm working them one against the other
 

207
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,580
I'm working them one against the other
so this one is being pushed against this

208
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,590
so this one is being pushed against this
 

209
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,380
so this one is being pushed against this
one and they're both working for me to

210
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,390
one and they're both working for me to
 

211
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,970
one and they're both working for me to
get that free now of course when I'm

212
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:24,980
get that free now of course when I'm
 

213
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,130
get that free now of course when I'm
popping free I prefer not to be in this

214
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,140
popping free I prefer not to be in this
 

215
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,110
popping free I prefer not to be in this
position I'd be trying to move here to

216
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
position I'd be trying to move here to
 

217
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,789
position I'd be trying to move here to
get a heat though of me or an eating me

218
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
get a heat though of me or an eating me
 

219
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,350
get a heat though of me or an eating me
position from this so that's my goal

220
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,360
position from this so that's my goal
 

221
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,940
position from this so that's my goal
so whenever that's happening I'm trying

222
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:33,950
so whenever that's happening I'm trying
 

223
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,350
so whenever that's happening I'm trying
to find one arm against the other and

224
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
to find one arm against the other and
 

225
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,060
to find one arm against the other and
use them against each other so that's

226
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,070
use them against each other so that's
 

227
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,849
use them against each other so that's
how we would work our Buchi warrant now

228
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:39,859
how we would work our Buchi warrant now
 

229
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,590
how we would work our Buchi warrant now
our silk Awards are generally not gonna

230
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:41,600
our silk Awards are generally not gonna
 

231
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,210
our silk Awards are generally not gonna
work for us now the reason for this is

232
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:43,220
work for us now the reason for this is
 

233
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,130
work for us now the reason for this is
because this grips really good you can

234
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,140
because this grips really good you can
 

235
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,050
because this grips really good you can
always kind of use it to track around so

236
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,060
always kind of use it to track around so
 

237
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,490
always kind of use it to track around so
as I'm pushing one off you can always

238
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:48,500
as I'm pushing one off you can always
 

239
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,050
as I'm pushing one off you can always
kind of track me track me track me I

240
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,060
kind of track me track me track me I
 

241
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,030
kind of track me track me track me I
might get away with so don't worry if I

242
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,040
might get away with so don't worry if I
 

243
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,470
might get away with so don't worry if I
did it really fast and I was stronger

244
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,480
did it really fast and I was stronger
 

245
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,030
did it really fast and I was stronger
than him but if I'm not I probably never

246
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
than him but if I'm not I probably never
 

247
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,319
than him but if I'm not I probably never
gonna get away with that so I'm going to

248
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,329
gonna get away with that so I'm going to
 

249
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,870
gonna get away with that so I'm going to
be stuck to more of using triangle

250
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:58,880
be stuck to more of using triangle
 

251
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,479
be stuck to more of using triangle

a 45 put pressure on this inside arm and
 

267
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,830
a 45 put pressure on this inside arm and
pull the other one free so I'm going to

268
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
pull the other one free so I'm going to
 

269
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,539
pull the other one free so I'm going to
go here and that's what I'm looking for

270
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:19,549
go here and that's what I'm looking for
 

271
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,819
go here and that's what I'm looking for
is to get that completely free so I'm

00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:21,829
is to get that completely free so I'm
 

273
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,460
is to get that completely free so I'm
applying poi this way and applying

277
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,850
pressure to this hand this way as I come
up and I'm looking to get that kind of

278
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:27,860
up and I'm looking to get that kind of
 

279
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,710
up and I'm looking to get that kind of
escape that's my general idea now when I

that way so as I come out Bank here
 

287
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,260
that way so as I come out Bank here
would be right here in this position

288
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,270
would be right here in this position

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,410
from Heathrow me to eating me here if I
 

293
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,670
from Heathrow me to eating me here if I
had my way now if that doesn't work for

294
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
had my way now if that doesn't work for
 

295
