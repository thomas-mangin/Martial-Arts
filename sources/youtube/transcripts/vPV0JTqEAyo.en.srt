00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
that is as we are going to use the
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,470
that is as we are going to use the
spiral rotating crosses and again that

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
spiral rotating crosses and again that
 

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,510
spiral rotating crosses and again that
is key that is key to iida that you

is key that is key to iida that you
 

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,390
is key that is key to iida that you
spiral rotate the yin yangong axis

14
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
spiral rotate the yin yangong axis
 

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,550
spiral rotate the yin yangong axis
because that is the technology of self

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,520
relationship between yin and yang how do
 

29
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,229
relationship between yin and yang how do
you do that you rotate them just like

30
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,239
you do that you rotate them just like
 

31
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,750
you do that you rotate them just like
you do your your Tom den and when you do

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,150
you do your your Tom den and when you do
that that the magic happens why because

the doubt okay that's what we're doing

40
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:03,640
the doubt okay that's what we're doing
 

41
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,390
the doubt okay that's what we're doing
so nobody can tell me that we shouldn't

42
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
so nobody can tell me that we shouldn't
 

43
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,350
so nobody can tell me that we shouldn't
be spiral rotating the yin Yong axis so

44
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,360
be spiral rotating the yin Yong axis so
 

45
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,510
be spiral rotating the yin Yong axis so
even if cha Sensei himself told me no no

so if you look and eventually you'll

56
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
so if you look and eventually you'll
 

57
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,109
so if you look and eventually you'll
figure this out the spiral rotating that

58
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
figure this out the spiral rotating that
 

59
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,670
figure this out the spiral rotating that
we're doing

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,109
especially a blade uh on very small
small circles is if we're at the end of

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,510
small circles is if we're at the end of

circles to spiral rotate the uh Yin Yong
 

89
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,830
circles to spiral rotate the uh Yin Yong
axis so that makes sense though

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
axis so that makes sense though
 

91
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,270

martially speaking because he's trying

92
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,280
martially speaking because he's trying
 

93
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,150
martially speaking because he's trying
to use a bladed weapon to the best of

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,160
to use a bladed weapon to the best of
 

95
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,390
to use a bladed weapon to the best of
its ability and that would be uh and

96
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
its ability and that would be uh and
 

97
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,750
its ability and that would be uh and
it's shorter that would be stay at the

98
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
it's shorter that would be stay at the
 

99
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,150
it's shorter that would be stay at the
edge of his weapon okay and defang the

100
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
edge of his weapon okay and defang the
 

101
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,830
edge of his weapon okay and defang the
snake instead so this makes Marshal

102
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
snake instead so this makes Marshal
 

103
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,670
snake instead so this makes Marshal
sense and this makes mechanical sense

104
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
sense and this makes mechanical sense
 

105
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,630
sense and this makes mechanical sense
and when it comes to move one it is very

106
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
and when it comes to move one it is very
 

107
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,630
and when it comes to move one it is very
important that you set up that my and

00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
you may see some forms where we hanging
 

117
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,110
you may see some forms where we hanging
out like this and I would say I would I

118
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
out like this and I would say I would I
 

119
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,550

00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:57,560
would never do that just like if he's a
 

121
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,830
would never do that just like if he's a
taller he's a taller Fighter for example

122
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
taller he's a taller Fighter for example

uh don't throw your sword down and let's

124
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
uh don't throw your sword down and let's
 

125
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,390
uh don't throw your sword down and let's
just have this hand in your fighting

126
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
just have this hand in your fighting
 

127
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,229
just have this hand in your fighting
position it doesn't do me any good to

fight within his jab range because I

130
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:11,879
fight within his jab range because I
 

131
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,190
fight within his jab range because I
cannot hit him because he's taller than

132
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,200
cannot hit him because he's taller than
 

133
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,990
cannot hit him because he's taller than
me so I can't stand then where I could

134
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,000
me so I can't stand then where I could
 

135
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,309
me so I can't stand then where I could
jab him because by the time I get there

136
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
jab him because by the time I get there
 

137
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,550
jab him because by the time I get there
he would have already jabbed me so the

138
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
he would have already jabbed me so the
 

139
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,589
he would have already jabbed me so the
person with longer range I have to fight

140
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
person with longer range I have to fight
 

141
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,149
person with longer range I have to fight
outside of his range not not inside my

142
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,159
outside of his range not not inside my
 

143
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,750
outside of his range not not inside my
range okay and you have to figure out

144
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
range okay and you have to figure out
 

145
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,789
range okay and you have to figure out
techniques of closing the Gap so one

146
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
techniques of closing the Gap so one
 

147
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,350
techniques of closing the Gap so one
might be uh as as he throws that jab

148
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:40,360
might be uh as as he throws that jab
 

149
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,110
might be uh as as he throws that jab
boom I'll just smack the jab down very

150
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
boom I'll just smack the jab down very
 

151
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,070
boom I'll just smack the jab down very
much like defanging the snake Okay and

152
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
much like defanging the snake Okay and
 

153
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,589
much like defanging the snake Okay and
then I would close okay so I'm not a fan

154
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
then I would close okay so I'm not a fan
 

155
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,750
then I would close okay so I'm not a fan
of this I know there's lots of like

156
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
of this I know there's lots of like
 

157
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,110
of this I know there's lots of like
shindo techniques where they like that

158
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
shindo techniques where they like that
 

159
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,390
shindo techniques where they like that
but to me that doesn't make sense okay

160
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
but to me that doesn't make sense okay
 

161
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,910
but to me that doesn't make sense okay
uh it's it's trying to do something else

162
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
uh it's it's trying to do something else
 

163
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,830
uh it's it's trying to do something else

we're out out of range he's out of my
 

167
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,830
we're out out of range he's out of my
range okay and so when we close when he

168
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
range okay and so when we close when he
 

169
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,309
range okay and so when we close when he
goes up it's important that I stay when

170
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,319
goes up it's important that I stay when
 

171
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,390

176
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
middle of my weapon okay and that has to
 

177
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,670
middle of my weapon okay and that has to
do where you

178
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680

 

179
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,590

start up boom he's at the edge okay so

180
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,600
start up boom he's at the edge okay so
 

181
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,110
start up boom he's at the edge okay so
let's key that in and then uh we'll go

182
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
let's key that in and then uh we'll go
 

183
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,150
let's key that in and then uh we'll go
from

184
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
from
 

185
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,790
from
there okay so uh if we look at some

186
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
there okay so uh if we look at some
 

187
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,790
there okay so uh if we look at some
things so let's say he he brings his

188
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
things so let's say he he brings his
 

189
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,230
things so let's say he he brings his
weapon up okay and let's say he had uh

weapon up okay and let's say he had uh
 

191
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,430
weapon up okay and let's say he had uh
ski

192
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,440
ski
 

193
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,870
ski
potential like he's going to hit me so

194
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
potential like he's going to hit me so
 

195
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,590
potential like he's going to hit me so
remember I described it as he's just

196
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,600
remember I described it as he's just
 

197
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,110
remember I described it as he's just
taking a uh a counter position to where

198
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,120
taking a uh a counter position to where
 

199
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,909
taking a uh a counter position to where
my weapon is okay but let's say he has

200
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:58,919
my weapon is okay but let's say he has
 

201
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,590
my weapon is okay but let's say he has
ski potential stay there please then he

202
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
ski potential stay there please then he
 

203
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,189
ski potential stay there please then he
would have to be way closer to me and

204
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:04,199
would have to be way closer to me and
 

205
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,909
would have to be way closer to me and
that weapon would have to penetrate my

206
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
that weapon would have to penetrate my
 

207
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,790
that weapon would have to penetrate my
Target because touching me in the face

208
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
Target because touching me in the face
 

209
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,909
Target because touching me in the face
here is not ski potential just just like

210
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
here is not ski potential just just like
 

211
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,909
here is not ski potential just just like
if he poked me in the ribs this is not

212
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:14,919
if he poked me in the ribs this is not
 

213
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,629
if he poked me in the ribs this is not
ski potential he has to get way closer

214
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
ski potential he has to get way closer
 

215
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,110
ski potential he has to get way closer
than that to have enough penet

216
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,120
than that to have enough penet
 

217
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,990
than that to have enough penet
penetration no different than on a punch

218
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,000
penetration no different than on a punch
 

219
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,909
penetration no different than on a punch
so when I'm here like this and I'm just

220
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
so when I'm here like this and I'm just
 

221
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,150
so when I'm here like this and I'm just
kissing the surface of this that's not a

222
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,160
kissing the surface of this that's not a
 

223
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,909
kissing the surface of this that's not a
punch my punches are in here where they

224
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
punch my punches are in here where they
 

225
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,870
punch my punches are in here where they
can penetrate through the Target or if I

226
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
can penetrate through the Target or if I
 

227
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,749
can penetrate through the Target or if I
was kicking the target I don't kiss the

228
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
was kicking the target I don't kiss the
 

229
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,590
was kicking the target I don't kiss the
target I have to be able to penetrate

230
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:40,600
target I have to be able to penetrate
 

231
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,870
target I have to be able to penetrate
the Target and you can see how much

232
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
the Target and you can see how much
 

233
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,070
the Target and you can see how much
closer boom I have to be in order to do

234
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
closer boom I have to be in order to do
 

235
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,590
closer boom I have to be in order to do
that okay so same thing

236
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600
that okay so same thing
 

237
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,350
that okay so same thing
here so if he was to do a ski to my

238
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
here so if he was to do a ski to my
 

239
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,830
here so if he was to do a ski to my
face first move he'd have to be here

240
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
face first move he'd have to be here
 

241
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,670
face first move he'd have to be here
does that make sense okay and then he

242
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,680
does that make sense okay and then he
 

243
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,510
does that make sense okay and then he
would have to do Sugi to get there so

244
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:04,520
would have to do Sugi to get there so
 

245
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,589
would have to do Sugi to get there so
you get to shuffle backwards one two now

246
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:09,599
you get to shuffle backwards one two now
 

247
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,070
you get to shuffle backwards one two now
put the Joe down and that's where he

248
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
put the Joe down and that's where he
 

249
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,189
put the Joe down and that's where he
would have to be standing for us to do

250
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:14,199
would have to be standing for us to do
 

251
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,790
would have to be standing for us to do
the form okay for that to be a ski well

252
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:17,800
the form okay for that to be a ski well
 

253
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,710
the form okay for that to be a ski well
he's never going to get there cuz he's

254
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:19,720
he's never going to get there cuz he's
 

255
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,510
he's never going to get there cuz he's
in my range

256
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
in my range
 

257
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,510
in my range
okay um so there's no way it's a ski

258
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
okay um so there's no way it's a ski
 

259
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,870

00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:33,319
now if we go back and he sticks that up
 

263
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,909
now if we go back and he sticks that up
there and here I'm trying to understand

264
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:34,919
there and here I'm trying to understand
 

265
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,510
there and here I'm trying to understand
the M because this is move one setting

266
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
the M because this is move one setting
 

267
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,749
the M because this is move one setting
up the initial mod if he's just here do

do a single Pivot Point I've already got

288
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:12,199
do a single Pivot Point I've already got
 

289
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,909
do a single Pivot Point I've already got
some distance do you see where where it

290
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
some distance do you see where where it
 

291
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,150
some distance do you see where where it
is right here like 2 in I I shift my

292
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
is right here like 2 in I I shift my
 

293
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,550
is right here like 2 in I I shift my
weight I've now got like a foot almost

294
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
weight I've now got like a foot almost
 

295
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,990
weight I've now got like a foot almost
and then when I turn I got another 2 in

296
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,000
and then when I turn I got another 2 in
 

297
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,869
and then when I turn I got another 2 in
and then when I step back I got even

298
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:25,879
and then when I step back I got even
 

299
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,110
and then when I step back I got even
more okay and so if I have my S where

300
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
more okay and so if I have my S where
 

301
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,830
more okay and so if I have my S where

to get cut okay so you have to stay in a
 

369
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,990
to get cut okay so you have to stay in a
Range as we go Bo let's go you have to

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,000
Range as we go Bo let's go you have to
 

371
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,069
Range as we go Bo let's go you have to
stay in a Range that it doesn't make

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:27,399
because it's going to be cut by the time
 

377
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,230
because it's going to be cut by the time
he closes to that range okay so that's

378
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
he closes to that range okay so that's
 

379
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,630
he closes to that range okay so that's
the flip side of the initial range one

380
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,640
the flip side of the initial range one

you have to spiral rotate the cross

400
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,440
you have to spiral rotate the cross
 

401
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,190
you have to spiral rotate the cross
there's just it's not iido if you're not

402
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,200
there's just it's not iido if you're not
 

403
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,750
there's just it's not iido if you're not
doing that okay but I said that that

404
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
doing that okay but I said that that
 

405
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,069
doing that okay but I said that that
spiral rotation is going to be very

406
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:09,079
spiral rotation is going to be very
 

407
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,269
spiral rotation is going to be very
small very short and the reason being is

408
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:14,279
small very short and the reason being is
 

409
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,150
small very short and the reason being is
a principle called the outer rim my

a principle called the outer rim my
 

411
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,829
a principle called the outer rim my
weapons can never go outside my outer

weapons can never go outside my outer
 

413
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,630
weapons can never go outside my outer
rim and they can't go outside of his

rim and they can't go outside of his
 

415
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,110

Outer Rim because my weapon must always

416
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
Outer Rim because my weapon must always
 

417
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,710
Outer Rim because my weapon must always
be oriented towards him okay so what

418
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
be oriented towards him okay so what
 

419
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,750
be oriented towards him okay so what
this means if you just look at his body

420
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
this means if you just look at his body
 

421
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,550
this means if you just look at his body
he's got a width to him and the outer

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:41,720
rib goes uh on the lateral margin is the
 

425
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,710
rib goes uh on the lateral margin is the
shoulders and then on the top margin

it's where the the curvature of the head

428
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
it's where the the curvature of the head
 

429
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,389
it's where the the curvature of the head
doesn't go to the top okay so uh what I

430
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
doesn't go to the top okay so uh what I
 

431
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,670
doesn't go to the top okay so uh what I
mean by curvature of the head about here

432
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
mean by curvature of the head about here
 

433
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,430
mean by curvature of the head about here
if I hit him it glances off it's where I

434
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,440
if I hit him it glances off it's where I
 

435
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,350
if I hit him it glances off it's where I
don't glance off anymore so it's

436
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,360
don't glance off anymore so it's
 

437
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,269

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
in but you also can't bring it up
 

475
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,509
in but you also can't bring it up
because it ca straight up because it

476
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:52,519
because it ca straight up because it
 

477
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,350
because it ca straight up because it
causes tension in the right shoulder as

478
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
causes tension in the right shoulder as
 

479
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,550
causes tension in the right shoulder as
you do this which can also be exploited

480
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
you do this which can also be exploited
 

481
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,790
you do this which can also be exploited
by him

482
00:11:59,790 --> 00:11:59,800
by him
 

483
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,910
by him
so I'm going to make a circle with my

484
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
so I'm going to make a circle with my
 

485
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,310
so I'm going to make a circle with my
right hand to lower the proximal end but

486
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
right hand to lower the proximal end but
 

487
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,710
right hand to lower the proximal end but
I have to keep my distl end no further

488
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:09,720
I have to keep my distl end no further
 

489
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,030
I have to keep my distl end no further
to my left his right than his right

490
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
to my left his right than his right
 

491
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,069
to my left his right than his right
shoulder so it goes up this

492
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,079

 

493
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,870

way not this

494
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880

 

495
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,150

way within his shoulder

496
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,160

 

497
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:34,870

R within his shoulder R

498
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880

 

499
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,030

Bo okay that's going to keep us where we

500
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
Bo okay that's going to keep us where we
 

501
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,590
Bo okay that's going to keep us where we
need to be and make sense because as I

502
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
need to be and make sense because as I
 

503
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,870
need to be and make sense because as I
said if I were to go outside he goes to

504
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:43,880
said if I were to go outside he goes to
 

505
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,910
said if I were to go outside he goes to
jodon and if I go outside he should just

506
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:46,920
jodon and if I go outside he should just
 

507
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,990
jodon and if I go outside he should just
attack the arm it's right there

508
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
attack the arm it's right there
 

509
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,189
attack the arm it's right there
okay so you have to make sure you're

510
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:52,199
okay so you have to make sure you're
 

511
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,269
okay so you have to make sure you're
doing that so that he is motivated to

512
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
doing that so that he is motivated to
 

513
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,910
doing that so that he is motivated to
stay at the distal end and not go right

514
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
stay at the distal end and not go right
 

515
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,389
stay at the distal end and not go right
for the cut

516
00:12:59,389 --> 00:12:59,399
for the cut
 

517
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,350
for the cut
so that he is motivated to spiral rotate

518
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,360
so that he is motivated to spiral rotate
 

519
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,949
so that he is motivated to spiral rotate
the yyong axis okay if you look at

520
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:05,959
the yyong axis okay if you look at
 

521
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,590
the yyong axis okay if you look at
everyone else what they do and I'm going

522
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
everyone else what they do and I'm going
 

523
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,509
everyone else what they do and I'm going
to have to show you the wrong way you

524
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:10,519
to have to show you the wrong way you
 

525
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,110
to have to show you the wrong way you
bring your sword

526
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,120
bring your sword
 

527
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,590
bring your sword
up and when you step back just hit it

528
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:16,600
up and when you step back just hit it
 

529
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,990
up and when you step back just hit it
horizontal down here like that

530
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
horizontal down here like that
 

531
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,550
horizontal down here like that
okay come

532
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:23,560
okay come
 

533
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,310
okay come
back so he brings the sword up I want to

534
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
back so he brings the sword up I want to
 

535
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,189
back so he brings the sword up I want to
make sure you could do it you step back

536
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:28,199
make sure you could do it you step back
 

537
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,150
make sure you could do it you step back
and you bring it horizontal down okay

538
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,160
and you bring it horizontal down okay
 

539
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,189
and you bring it horizontal down okay
come back and hence my weapon was going

540
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199
come back and hence my weapon was going
 

541
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,590
come back and hence my weapon was going
up his sword is going down it's a Yong

542
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:38,600
up his sword is going down it's a Yong
 

543
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,470
up his sword is going down it's a Yong
Yong Clash we're just hitting sticks

544
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,480
Yong Clash we're just hitting sticks
 

545
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,110
Yong Clash we're just hitting sticks
okay and if I'm strong enough to do this

546
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
okay and if I'm strong enough to do this
 

547
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,150
okay and if I'm strong enough to do this
when he goes down it's his weapon that

548
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
when he goes down it's his weapon that
 

549
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,470
when he goes down it's his weapon that
would move not my weapon that would move

550
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,480
would move not my weapon that would move
 

551
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,470
would move not my weapon that would move
okay so he has to do like keto and he

552
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
okay so he has to do like keto and he
 

553
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,189
okay so he has to do like keto and he
has to spiral rotate the cross and to do

554
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
has to spiral rotate the cross and to do
 

555
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,749
has to spiral rotate the cross and to do
that he has to First fill the in space

556
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:01,759
that he has to First fill the in space
 

557
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,509
that he has to First fill the in space
to the Y to the Yong adhesion point and

558
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
to the Y to the Yong adhesion point and
 

559
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,870
to the Y to the Yong adhesion point and
hence his first move is not the

560
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
hence his first move is not the
 

561
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,470
hence his first move is not the
immediate hitting of my weapon down but

562
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
immediate hitting of my weapon down but
 

563
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,069
immediate hitting of my weapon down but
that make a cross on the inside of the

564
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
that make a cross on the inside of the
 

565
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,269
that make a cross on the inside of the
weapon the Yang side is the top of my

566
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
weapon the Yang side is the top of my
 

567
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,829
weapon the Yang side is the top of my
Joe spine but on the inside lateral side

568
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
Joe spine but on the inside lateral side
 

569
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,670
Joe spine but on the inside lateral side
it's Yin space and that's where he

570
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:26,680
it's Yin space and that's where he
 

571
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,310
it's Yin space and that's where he
penetrates closes the distance and makes

572
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
penetrates closes the distance and makes
 

573
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,550
penetrates closes the distance and makes
contact so we're going to go slow so

574
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,560
contact so we're going to go slow so
 

575
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,590
contact so we're going to go slow so
he's going up I'm coming up and he first

576
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,600
he's going up I'm coming up and he first
 

577
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,310
he's going up I'm coming up and he first
this is too sharp you guys see that it's

578
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,320
this is too sharp you guys see that it's
 

579
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,550
this is too sharp you guys see that it's
too sharp your two this

580
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
too sharp your two this
 

581
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,269
too sharp your two this
way and if I was strong enough boom it's

582
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
way and if I was strong enough boom it's
 

583
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,069
way and if I was strong enough boom it's
your weapon that moves okay so

584
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
your weapon that moves okay so
 

585
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,150
your weapon that moves okay so
instead you should just reach to make a

586
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
instead you should just reach to make a
 

587
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,990
instead you should just reach to make a
cross with no movement of my weapon

588
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,000
cross with no movement of my weapon
 

589
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,790
cross with no movement of my weapon
don't move it this is where he should be

590
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
don't move it this is where he should be
 

591
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,350
don't move it this is where he should be
okay so let's let me show that cuz he

592
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
okay so let's let me show that cuz he
 

593
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,829
okay so let's let me show that cuz he
does he didn't have that

594
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:06,839

 

595
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,749

skill he didn't have the skill cuz he's

596
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:09,759
skill he didn't have the skill cuz he's
 

597
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,790
skill he didn't have the skill cuz he's
learning the majority of people don't

598
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
learning the majority of people don't
 

599
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,110
learning the majority of people don't
have the skill so they do something that

600
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,120
have the skill so they do something that
 

601
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,269
have the skill so they do something that
is not iido and then probably wouldn't

602
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
is not iido and then probably wouldn't
 

603
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,150
is not iido and then probably wouldn't
work

604
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,160
work
 

605
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,350
work
anyways because we're not understanding

606
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
anyways because we're not understanding
 

607
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,990
anyways because we're not understanding
the spiraling cross okay so when I go in

608
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,000
the spiraling cross okay so when I go in
 

609
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,790
the spiraling cross okay so when I go in
and his weapon comes up my movement goes

610
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:25,800
and his weapon comes up my movement goes
 

611
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,590
and his weapon comes up my movement goes
here right

612
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
here right
 

613
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,870
here right
here there's

614
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:29,880
here there's
 

615
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,269
here there's
no pressure do you see that I just reach

616
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:34,279
no pressure do you see that I just reach
 

617
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,829
no pressure do you see that I just reach
to touch it and once I reach to touch it

618
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
to touch it and once I reach to touch it
 

619
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,749
to touch it and once I reach to touch it
if you if I hold it right there I now

620
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
if you if I hold it right there I now
 

621
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,189
if you if I hold it right there I now
have my Yin Andy Yang axis okay and now

622
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
have my Yin Andy Yang axis okay and now
 

623
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,030
have my Yin Andy Yang axis okay and now
I'm going to rotate

624
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm going to rotate
 

625
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,870
I'm going to rotate
it and now I've reconciled his upward

626
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:49,880
it and now I've reconciled his upward
 

627
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,350
it and now I've reconciled his upward
energy okay and that's what I've done

628
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,360
energy okay and that's what I've done
 

629
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,949
energy okay and that's what I've done
and then I can have this angle of attack

630
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
and then I can have this angle of attack
 

631
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,430
and then I can have this angle of attack
where I take this complimentary angle

632
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
where I take this complimentary angle
 

633
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,189
where I take this complimentary angle
from the I

634
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
from the I
 

635
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,030
from the I
adhesion through I won the fight okay so

636
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,040
adhesion through I won the fight okay so
 

637
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,110
adhesion through I won the fight okay so
the point here is how to understand the

638
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,120
the point here is how to understand the
 

639
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,870
the point here is how to understand the
spiral rotating cross first move is make

640
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
spiral rotating cross first move is make
 

641
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,949
spiral rotating cross first move is make
the inside reach the inside establish

642
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:15,959
the inside reach the inside establish
 

643
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,749
the inside reach the inside establish
the XY AIS and then rotate it okay so

644
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:20,759
the XY AIS and then rotate it okay so
 

645
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,990
the XY AIS and then rotate it okay so
that's what I'm going to show again on

646
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
that's what I'm going to show again on
 

647
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,470
that's what I'm going to show again on
the first move boom nice and slow boom

648
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
the first move boom nice and slow boom
 

649
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,189
the first move boom nice and slow boom
no pressure now I have it and now I

650
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
no pressure now I have it and now I
 

651
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,509
no pressure now I have it and now I
rotate the cross then I follow the

652
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
rotate the cross then I follow the
 

653
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,870
rotate the cross then I follow the
complimentary angle in from the adhesion

654
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
complimentary angle in from the adhesion
 

655
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,949
complimentary angle in from the adhesion
into the

656
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:37,959

 

657
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,870

weapon up there's the cross rotate the

658
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880
weapon up there's the cross rotate the
 

659
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,309
weapon up there's the cross rotate the
cross follow the compliment angle in

660
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
cross follow the compliment angle in
 

661
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,030
cross follow the compliment angle in
from the

662
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,040

 

663
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:57,470

ad boom

664
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480

 

665
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,430

boom

666
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
boom
 

667
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:21,870
boom
no

668
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:21,880

 

669
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,429

pressure okay move

670
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:24,439
pressure okay move
 

671
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,549
pressure okay move
four I the and going over the rotating

672
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:27,559
four I the and going over the rotating
 

673
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,590
four I the and going over the rotating
cross on move four but we have to bring

674
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
cross on move four but we have to bring
 

675
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,270
cross on move four but we have to bring
up another Marshal concept and that is

676
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
up another Marshal concept and that is
 

677
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,470
up another Marshal concept and that is
that my defense is made up minimum of

678
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,480
that my defense is made up minimum of
 

679
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,710
that my defense is made up minimum of
two things my angle of deflection so

680
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:39,720
two things my angle of deflection so
 

681
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,909
two things my angle of deflection so
however I'm dealing uh with his line of

682
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:42,919
however I'm dealing uh with his line of
 

683
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,110
however I'm dealing uh with his line of
attack and not let it follow me in the

684
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,120
attack and not let it follow me in the
 

685
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,470
attack and not let it follow me in the
second aspect of my defense my angle of

686
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,480
second aspect of my defense my angle of
 

687
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,630
second aspect of my defense my angle of
deviation okay so some simple things and

688
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
deviation okay so some simple things and
 

689
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,789
deviation okay so some simple things and
not necessarily iido if here's his punch

690
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:55,799
not necessarily iido if here's his punch
 

691
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,870
not necessarily iido if here's his punch
my angle of deflection would be my

692
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:57,880
my angle of deflection would be my
 

693
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,190
my angle of deflection would be my
inward carry and is traveling to my left

694
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
inward carry and is traveling to my left
 

695
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,590
inward carry and is traveling to my left
okay and my angle of deviation is going

696
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:04,600
okay and my angle of deviation is going
 

697
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,909
okay and my angle of deviation is going
to be my step out to the side okay and

698
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
to be my step out to the side okay and
 

699
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,750
to be my step out to the side okay and
the general rule is that they must

700
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
the general rule is that they must
 

701
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,070
the general rule is that they must
complement each other so if I have a

702
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
complement each other so if I have a
 

703
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,149
complement each other so if I have a
inward Parry then my footwork must take

704
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:17,159
inward Parry then my footwork must take
 

705
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,230
inward Parry then my footwork must take
me to the outside if the punch goes one

706
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
me to the outside if the punch goes one
 

707
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,310
me to the outside if the punch goes one
way I go the other way okay all right so

708
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,320
way I go the other way okay all right so
 

709
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,909
way I go the other way okay all right so
here we go and when it comes to move

710
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
here we go and when it comes to move
 

711
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,029
here we go and when it comes to move
four I I have to do that okay so he goes

712
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
four I I have to do that okay so he goes
 

713
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,909
four I I have to do that okay so he goes
up I go down and he's going to cut my

714
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:34,919
up I go down and he's going to cut my
 

715
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,470
up I go down and he's going to cut my
arm okay first let me fix his mistake

716
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:37,480
arm okay first let me fix his mistake
 

717
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,190
arm okay first let me fix his mistake
there you still have that outer

718
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,200
there you still have that outer
 

719
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,190
there you still have that outer
rib and you cannot Point your weapon

720
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
rib and you cannot Point your weapon
 

721
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:52,750
rib and you cannot Point your weapon
down right okay so let's fix

722
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:52,760

 

723
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,390

that again the rule on the weapon is

724
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:55,400
that again the rule on the weapon is
 

725
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,230
that again the rule on the weapon is
your weapon has to always be pointed at

726
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,240
your weapon has to always be pointed at
 

727
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,750
your weapon has to always be pointed at
the adversary so I cannot point it over

728
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
the adversary so I cannot point it over
 

729
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,669
the adversary so I cannot point it over
here we know already that that'll open

730
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
here we know already that that'll open
 

731
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,950
here we know already that that'll open
up the lateral spine but I cannot point

732
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:03,960
up the lateral spine but I cannot point
 

733
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,470
up the lateral spine but I cannot point
it to the ground either okay then the

734
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
it to the ground either okay then the
 

735
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,149
it to the ground either okay then the
weapon is not in the fight the weapon

736
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:08,159
weapon is not in the fight the weapon
 

737
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,029
weapon is not in the fight the weapon
has to always be in the fight and for

738
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:10,039
has to always be in the fight and for
 

739
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,750
has to always be in the fight and for
the weapon to be in the fight it must be

740
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
the weapon to be in the fight it must be
 

741
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,950
the weapon to be in the fight it must be
pointed at you at all times okay so when

742
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
pointed at you at all times okay so when
 

743
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,470
pointed at you at all times okay so when
we do that move boom I cannot go here

744
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,480
we do that move boom I cannot go here
 

745
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,350
we do that move boom I cannot go here
because the weapon is now not in the

746
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
because the weapon is now not in the
 

747
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,950
because the weapon is now not in the
fight and his weapon is actually more in

748
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:23,960
fight and his weapon is actually more in
 

749
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,590
fight and his weapon is actually more in
fight than my weapon okay so my atos

750
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
fight than my weapon okay so my atos
 

751
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,830
fight than my weapon okay so my atos
that I do it can't go past boom parallel

752
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
that I do it can't go past boom parallel
 

753
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,310
that I do it can't go past boom parallel
to the ground all of the downward the

754
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,320
to the ground all of the downward the
 

755
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,909
to the ground all of the downward the
drop cannot go past parallel if I wanted

756
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:38,919
drop cannot go past parallel if I wanted
 

757
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,149
drop cannot go past parallel if I wanted
more drop then I have to lower my stance

758
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:42,159
more drop then I have to lower my stance
 

759
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,430
more drop then I have to lower my stance
but I cannot point the tip down on any

760
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,440
but I cannot point the tip down on any
 

761
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,909
but I cannot point the tip down on any
atoui movements okay so again we're here

762
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:48,919
atoui movements okay so again we're here
 

763
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,950
atoui movements okay so again we're here
there's my rotating cross and the weapon

764
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:51,960
there's my rotating cross and the weapon
 

765
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,789
there's my rotating cross and the weapon
stays parallel to the ground that's all

766
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
stays parallel to the ground that's all
 

767
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,590
stays parallel to the ground that's all
I need for this movement is the cut

768
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
I need for this movement is the cut
 

769
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,470
I need for this movement is the cut
right there okay okay so don't push it

770
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,480
right there okay okay so don't push it
 

771
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,430
right there okay okay so don't push it
down like

772
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440

 

773
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,870

that and we'll end up giving the same

774
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
that and we'll end up giving the same
 

775
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,350
that and we'll end up giving the same
correction here eventually but I want to

776
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
correction here eventually but I want to
 

777
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,029
correction here eventually but I want to
go and talk about what I want to talk

778
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
go and talk about what I want to talk
 

779
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,390
go and talk about what I want to talk
about so angle deviation angle

780
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:13,400
about so angle deviation angle
 

781
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,590
about so angle deviation angle
deflection stay

782
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
deflection stay
 

783
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,029
deflection stay
there here he goes get us there all

784
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
there here he goes get us there all
 

785
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,110
there here he goes get us there all
right make the cross and get on top

786
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
right make the cross and get on top
 

787
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,750
right make the cross and get on top
before you get your attack stay

788
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
before you get your attack stay
 

789
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,630
before you get your attack stay
there I ended up deviating this way

790
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
there I ended up deviating this way
 

791
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,270
there I ended up deviating this way
okay here there's the cross and you're

792
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,280
okay here there's the cross and you're
 

793
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,870
okay here there's the cross and you're
going to rotate it okay I'm going to

794
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
going to rotate it okay I'm going to
 

795
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,710
going to rotate it okay I'm going to
move you're going to rotate it I'm going

796
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:39,720
move you're going to rotate it I'm going
 

797
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,750
move you're going to rotate it I'm going
to move inside this way

798
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
to move inside this way
 

799
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,110
to move inside this way
okay if I come over here stay there

800
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,120
okay if I come over here stay there
 

801
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,029
okay if I come over here stay there
there's no deviation going the other way

802
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:52,039
there's no deviation going the other way
 

803
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,470
there's no deviation going the other way
I move to the right no deviation going

804
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
I move to the right no deviation going
 

805
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,110
I move to the right no deviation going
to the left and this is why when I go to

806
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
to the left and this is why when I go to
 

807
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,710
to the left and this is why when I go to
ski he would be following the sword back

808
00:20:59,710 --> 00:20:59,720
ski he would be following the sword back
 

809
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,870
ski he would be following the sword back
in from his cut and you'd get

810
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:03,880
in from his cut and you'd get
 

811
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,110
in from his cut and you'd get
killed what my ski did is added

812
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
killed what my ski did is added
 

813
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,669
killed what my ski did is added
deviation following the rules that I

814
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
deviation following the rules that I
 

815
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,710
deviation following the rules that I
move his weapon to the left because I'm

816
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
move his weapon to the left because I'm
 

817
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,750
move his weapon to the left because I'm
going to the right

818
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:14,760
going to the right
 

819
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,149
going to the right
okay so we go one two

820
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:19,159
okay so we go one two
 

821
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,029
okay so we go one two
first here reach out and make a cross

822
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
first here reach out and make a cross
 

823
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,830
first here reach out and make a cross
rotate the cross okay and that drop that

824
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:26,840
rotate the cross okay and that drop that
 

825
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,590
rotate the cross okay and that drop that
I have there

826
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
I have there
 

827
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,590
I have there
I'm going to start moving to the right

828
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm going to start moving to the right
 

829
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,669
I'm going to start moving to the right
because he's going to start coming back

830
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
because he's going to start coming back
 

831
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,549
because he's going to start coming back
so as he comes back I move to the to the

832
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
so as he comes back I move to the to the
 

833
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,350
so as he comes back I move to the to the
right

834
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,360
right
 

835
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,549
right
okay we'll do it again one slower please

okay we'll do it again one slower please
 

837
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,390
okay we'll do it again one slower please
he goes one he comes back in I move to

838
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
he goes one he comes back in I move to

okay so I'm going to the right that's my

848
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
okay so I'm going to the right that's my
 

849
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,710
okay so I'm going to the right that's my
angle deviation going go slow for this

850
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
angle deviation going go slow for this
 

851
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,230
angle deviation going go slow for this
we'll just make

852
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,240
we'll just make
 

853
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,390
we'll just make
contact we already rotated let's

854
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
contact we already rotated let's
 

855
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,750
contact we already rotated let's
say go really

856
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:16,760
say go really
 

857
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,590
say go really
slow here's that

858
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,600
slow here's that
 

859
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,149
slow here's that
cross I'm going to move it

860
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
cross I'm going to move it
 

861
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,190
cross I'm going to move it
over with me as he's cutting and you can

862
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,200
over with me as he's cutting and you can
 

863
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,710
over with me as he's cutting and you can
see what it's doing I'm getting closer

864
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
see what it's doing I'm getting closer
 

865
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,950
see what it's doing I'm getting closer
to the end of the

866
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
to the end of the
 

867
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,909
to the end of the
weapons and so I brought my Joe if you

868
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:34,919
weapons and so I brought my Joe if you
 

869
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,990
weapons and so I brought my Joe if you
pay attention maybe it's over

870
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,000
pay attention maybe it's over
 

871
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,149
pay attention maybe it's over
here the tip of my Joe is INS is right

872
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:43,159
here the tip of my Joe is INS is right
 

873
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,909
here the tip of my Joe is INS is right
on the edge of his outer rim no like

874
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
on the edge of his outer rim no like
 

875
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,190
on the edge of his outer rim no like
this over here like

876
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,200
this over here like
 

877
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,470
this over here like
that and then I rotate this little cross

878
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
that and then I rotate this little cross
 

879
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,310
that and then I rotate this little cross
on my ski and I keep rotating it as

880
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
on my ski and I keep rotating it as
 

881
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,669
on my ski and I keep rotating it as
we're going back and that's how I get my

882
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
we're going back and that's how I get my
 

883
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,830
we're going back and that's how I get my
angle deflection the other way and I

884
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
angle deflection the other way and I
 

885
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,110
angle deflection the other way and I
open up the target

886
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120

 

887
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,390

here it is very tempting otherwise

888
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
here it is very tempting otherwise
 

889
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,190
here it is very tempting otherwise
everyone would be doing it and I think

890
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
everyone would be doing it and I think
 

891
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,230
everyone would be doing it and I think
if s say wanted you to do that he would

892
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,240
if s say wanted you to do that he would
 

893
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,950
if s say wanted you to do that he would
have done it and everyone would be doing

894
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
have done it and everyone would be doing
 

895
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,390
have done it and everyone would be doing
it it's very tempting to go here stay in

896
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
it it's very tempting to go here stay in
 

897
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,789
it it's very tempting to go here stay in
place and move this weapon like that and

898
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
place and move this weapon like that and
 

899
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,110
place and move this weapon like that and
that's not what I'm

900
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,120
that's not what I'm
 

901
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,230
that's not what I'm
doing you have to use a complimentary of

902
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
doing you have to use a complimentary of
 

903
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,590
doing you have to use a complimentary of
deviation with the angle of deflection

904
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
deviation with the angle of deflection
 

905
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,190
deviation with the angle of deflection
so as we go one and he starts to come

906
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
so as we go one and he starts to come
 

907
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,630
so as we go one and he starts to come
into the

908
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
into the
 

909
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,350
into the
hand I have to move to get my hand out

910
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,360
hand I have to move to get my hand out
 

911
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:52,350
hand I have to move to get my hand out
of the way boom boom

912
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,360

 

913
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,390

boom I call this mistake painting with

914
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,400
boom I call this mistake painting with
 

915
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,870
boom I call this mistake painting with
the distal

916
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
the distal
 

917
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,549
the distal
end I stay still and I move it around in

918
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
end I stay still and I move it around in
 

919
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,269
end I stay still and I move it around in
the circle there's no angle deviation

920
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:04,279
the circle there's no angle deviation
 

921
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,430
the circle there's no angle deviation
there if you watch your back hand is

922
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
there if you watch your back hand is
 

923
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,510
there if you watch your back hand is
making these big circles as well as your

924
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:10,520
making these big circles as well as your
 

925
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,390
making these big circles as well as your
front hand if I'm doing it correctly

926
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
front hand if I'm doing it correctly
 

927
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,630
front hand if I'm doing it correctly
it's just here boom

928
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640

 

929
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,789

boom and if you pay attention go back

930
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
boom and if you pay attention go back
 

931
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,110
boom and if you pay attention go back
stay there go

932
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
stay there go
 

933
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,750
stay there go
back hey fill the

934
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:28,760
back hey fill the
 

935
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,630
back hey fill the
space and then he went around the y

936
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
space and then he went around the y
 

937
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,190
space and then he went around the y
space I'm going to do the same thing to

938
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
space I'm going to do the same thing to
 

939
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,750
space I'm going to do the same thing to
him he has the Y Line cuz he has the

940
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
him he has the Y Line cuz he has the
 

941
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,630
him he has the Y Line cuz he has the
atos I have the yin space I'm going to

942
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:43,640
atos I have the yin space I'm going to
 

943
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,830
atos I have the yin space I'm going to
rotate stay there don't Shuffle in again

944
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:46,840
rotate stay there don't Shuffle in again
 

945
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,750
rotate stay there don't Shuffle in again
and now I've rotated the cross and I

946
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
and now I've rotated the cross and I
 

947
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,630
and now I've rotated the cross and I
keep it rotating past that way

948
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
keep it rotating past that way
 

949
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:03,669
keep it rotating past that way
boom so look for the cross to rotate

950
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679

 

951
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:19,149

sh

952
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:19,159

 

953
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,669

slower okay try again just explaining

954
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
slower okay try again just explaining
 

955
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,230
slower okay try again just explaining
the rotating cross I have to fill the in

956
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
the rotating cross I have to fill the in
 

957
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,389
the rotating cross I have to fill the in
space or allow to be in the in space in

958
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:28,399
space or allow to be in the in space in
 

959
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,789
space or allow to be in the in space in
this case and then I rotate the Y yin

960
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
this case and then I rotate the Y yin
 

961
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,830
this case and then I rotate the Y yin
and AIS I'm now the one doing the atage

962
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
and AIS I'm now the one doing the atage

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,360
again and that same rule would
 

967
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,230
again and that same rule would
apply so from the atos contact back I

968
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,240
apply so from the atos contact back I
 

969
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,310
apply so from the atos contact back I
cannot go he cuts I cannot point my

co-generate this is how I'll describe it
 

991
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,549
co-generate this is how I'll describe it
at first cogenerate the iky but really

992
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:23,559
at first cogenerate the iky but really
 

993
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,190
at first cogenerate the iky but really
if if I just release and relax the sword

the fear pride and ignorance and we're

1004
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:38,919
the fear pride and ignorance and we're
 

1005
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,549
the fear pride and ignorance and we're
trying to cogenerate the iy the spiral

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:41,559
trying to cogenerate the iy the spiral
 

1007
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,389
trying to cogenerate the iy the spiral
rotating crosses so I one I reach out

1008
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:45,399
rotating crosses so I one I reach out
 

1009
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,310
rotating crosses so I one I reach out
without pushing his weapon and I just

1021
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,430

okay let's go this drill that we're

1022
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:22,440
okay let's go this drill that we're
 

1023
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,430
okay let's go this drill that we're
doing that I'm trying to get them to do

1024
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:24,440
doing that I'm trying to get them to do
 

1025
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,110
doing that I'm trying to get them to do
is really a sensitivity drill but it's

1026
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
is really a sensitivity drill but it's
 

1027
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,830
is really a sensitivity drill but it's
also it's a release drill okay you could

1028
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
also it's a release drill okay you could
 

1029
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,070
also it's a release drill okay you could
I you could look it any way so as Karen

1030
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
I you could look it any way so as Karen
 

1031
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,230
I you could look it any way so as Karen
was saying and and I described to her

1032
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
was saying and and I described to her
 

1033
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,549
was saying and and I described to her
it's like it's a feeling okay it's a

1034
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
it's like it's a feeling okay it's a
 

1035
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,269
it's like it's a feeling okay it's a
feeling a we're talking about gaining

1036
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
feeling a we're talking about gaining
 

1037
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,230
feeling a we're talking about gaining
sensitivity okay

1038
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
sensitivity okay
 

1039
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,389
sensitivity okay
um and you become more sensitive when

1040
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:45,399
um and you become more sensitive when
 

1041
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,830
um and you become more sensitive when
your ego when the fear pride and

1042
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
your ego when the fear pride and
 

1043
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,310
your ego when the fear pride and
ignorance the three the three evils the

1044
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,320
ignorance the three the three evils the
 

1045
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,269
ignorance the three the three evils the
three demons are not pling you you

1046
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:52,279
three demons are not pling you you
 

1047
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,990
three demons are not pling you you
become more sensitive okay there's

1048
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,000
become more sensitive okay there's
 

1049
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,070
become more sensitive okay there's
there's a a correlation between that the

1050
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
there's a a correlation between that the
 

1051
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,909
there's a a correlation between that the
demon possession of those three demons

1052
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:00,919
demon possession of those three demons
 

1053
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,110
demon possession of those three demons
and awareness or his absence so the more

1054
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,120
and awareness or his absence so the more
 

1055
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,990
and awareness or his absence so the more
those demons possess you the less aware

1056
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
those demons possess you the less aware
 

1057
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,870
those demons possess you the less aware
you are so vice versa then this is about

1058
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:11,880
you are so vice versa then this is about
 

1059
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,509
you are so vice versa then this is about
becoming sensitive okay becoming aware

1060
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
becoming sensitive okay becoming aware
 

1061
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,470
becoming sensitive okay becoming aware
becoming sensitive so the drill that I'm

1062
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:17,480
becoming sensitive so the drill that I'm
 

1063
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,590
becoming sensitive so the drill that I'm
doing is uh as as we go on with the

1064
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
doing is uh as as we go on with the
 

1065
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,230
doing is uh as as we go on with the
drill is like I can I know where that

1066
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
drill is like I can I know where that
 

1067
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,789
drill is like I can I know where that
weapon is I don't ever overshoot it do

1068
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
weapon is I don't ever overshoot it do
 

1069
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,190
weapon is I don't ever overshoot it do
you see and I know that that's y if I go

1070
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,200
you see and I know that that's y if I go
 

1071
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,149
you see and I know that that's y if I go
any further that would be y I'm

1072
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
any further that would be y I'm
 

1073
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,509
any further that would be y I'm
sensitive to that and I am sensitive to

sensitive to that and I am sensitive to
 

1075
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,070
sensitive to that and I am sensitive to
where that Yin spot is on the back of

1076
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
where that Yin spot is on the back of
 

1077
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,269

any weight it doesn't take any weight
and I'm sensitive to the complimentary

1082
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
and I'm sensitive to the complimentary
 

1083
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,470
and I'm sensitive to the complimentary
angle so I can stay there I don't ever

1084
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
angle so I can stay there I don't ever
 

1085
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,269
angle so I can stay there I don't ever
would never do that you see I feel it

would never do that you see I feel it
 

1087
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,190
would never do that you see I feel it
and the weapon goes so as he goes and

1088
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,200
and the weapon goes so as he goes and
 

1089
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,750
and the weapon goes so as he goes and
I'm sensitive to what his weapon is I

1090
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:56,760
I'm sensitive to what his weapon is I
 

1091
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,710
I'm sensitive to what his weapon is I
can stay you're going to send it around

1092
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
can stay you're going to send it around
 

1093
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,269
can stay you're going to send it around
you're lost yes okay woo if I could get

1094
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
you're lost yes okay woo if I could get
 

1095
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,389
you're lost yes okay woo if I could get
through a demonstration okay so I'm here

1096
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:05,399
through a demonstration okay so I'm here
 

1097
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,630
through a demonstration okay so I'm here
here comes the cut and I know where the

1098
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:07,640
here comes the cut and I know where the
 

1099
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,509
here comes the cut and I know where the
yin space is in the in the circle as

1100
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:10,519
yin space is in the in the circle as
 

1101
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,430
yin space is in the in the circle as
this cross is

1102
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,440
this cross is
 

1103
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,750
this cross is
rotating because the way that I defend

1104
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:16,760
rotating because the way that I defend
 

1105
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,710
rotating because the way that I defend
myself is I rotate the cross he rotated

1106
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:21,720
myself is I rotate the cross he rotated
 

1107
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,430
myself is I rotate the cross he rotated
that's how you do it every single time

1108
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
that's how you do it every single time
 

1109
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,029
that's how you do it every single time
in the set okay so if I come flying off

1110
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
in the set okay so if I come flying off
 

1111
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,549
in the set okay so if I come flying off
of which I will if I go y against your

1112
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
of which I will if I go y against your
 

1113
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,310
of which I will if I go y against your
spiral rotating of the cross I will get

1114
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,320
spiral rotating of the cross I will get
 

1115
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,870
spiral rotating of the cross I will get
pinned the weapon will go fine off

1116
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
pinned the weapon will go fine off
 

1117
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,110
pinned the weapon will go fine off
you'll get your angle deflection and

1118
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,120
you'll get your angle deflection and
 

1119
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,909
you'll get your angle deflection and
boom I'm going to get skewer but if I'm

1120
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:41,919
boom I'm going to get skewer but if I'm
 

1121
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,509
boom I'm going to get skewer but if I'm
fine when you if I understand that as

1122
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:45,519
fine when you if I understand that as
 

1123
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,070
fine when you if I understand that as
you spir rotate the cross you actually

1124
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
you spir rotate the cross you actually
 

1125
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,470
you spir rotate the cross you actually
now put me in the in where I'm supposed

1126
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
now put me in the in where I'm supposed
 

1127
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,750
now put me in the in where I'm supposed
to be to again spir rotate the cross

1128
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
to be to again spir rotate the cross
 

1129
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,590
to be to again spir rotate the cross
okay and so I just have to be

1130
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
okay and so I just have to be
 

1131
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,430
okay and so I just have to be
comfortable with that and I have to feel

1132
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,440
comfortable with that and I have to feel
 

1133
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,029
comfortable with that and I have to feel
where is the in space what's it feel

1134
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
where is the in space what's it feel
 

1135
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,269
where is the in space what's it feel
like it feels like nothing I don't I

1136
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
like it feels like nothing I don't I
 

1137
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,549
like it feels like nothing I don't I
shouldn't feel anything I'm just hanging

1138
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:05,559
shouldn't feel anything I'm just hanging
 

1139
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,870
shouldn't feel anything I'm just hanging
out and letting everything happen Okay

1140
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:07,880
out and letting everything happen Okay
 

1141
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,070
out and letting everything happen Okay
so if I am doing that correctly and I

1142
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,080
so if I am doing that correctly and I
 

1143
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,950
so if I am doing that correctly and I
come here and I gain that feeling as he

1144
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:13,960
come here and I gain that feeling as he
 

1145
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,549
come here and I gain that feeling as he
goes I'm going to be right in the area

1146
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
goes I'm going to be right in the area
 

1147
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,310
goes I'm going to be right in the area
to do it all again right here so I do

1148
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,320
to do it all again right here so I do
 

1149
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,149
to do it all again right here so I do
the same thing again the cross I go to

1150
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
the same thing again the cross I go to
 

1151
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,870
the same thing again the cross I go to
the yin line here he go he's trying to

1152
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
the yin line here he go he's trying to
 

1153
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,549
the yin line here he go he's trying to
go here he penetrates make sure you ENT

1154
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:27,559
go here he penetrates make sure you ENT
 

1155
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,230
go here he penetrates make sure you ENT
please he penetrates and there's that

1156
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
please he penetrates and there's that
 

1157
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,549
please he penetrates and there's that
move pull and I've cut it off

1158
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559

 

1159
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,669

again so I'm here I need

1160
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
again so I'm here I need
 

1161
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,830
again so I'm here I need
him to rotate it so that I get Stu on

1162
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
him to rotate it so that I get Stu on
 

1163
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,190
him to rotate it so that I get Stu on
the other side he goes Bo and there it

1164
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
the other side he goes Bo and there it
 

1165
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,990
the other side he goes Bo and there it
is poop and

1166
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
is poop and
 

1167
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,350
is poop and
cut again I'm going to I I want us to do

1168
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
cut again I'm going to I I want us to do
 

1169
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,230
cut again I'm going to I I want us to do
it here with the releasing in mind so

1170
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
it here with the releasing in mind so
 

1171
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,710
it here with the releasing in mind so
we're not going to go fast F and I'm

1172
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:57,720
we're not going to go fast F and I'm
 

1173
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,990
we're not going to go fast F and I'm
going to try not to hold this thing

1174
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
going to try not to hold this thing
 

1175
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,549
going to try not to hold this thing
because if I if the sword is in the in

1176
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
because if I if the sword is in the in
 

1177
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,549
because if I if the sword is in the in
space I don't have to grip the sword and

1178
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
space I don't have to grip the sword and
 

1179
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,389
space I don't have to grip the sword and
if it's in here to you I don't have to

1180
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:07,399
if it's in here to you I don't have to
 

1181
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,830
if it's in here to you I don't have to
uh grip the sword and I don't have to

1182
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:08,840
uh grip the sword and I don't have to
 

1183
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,870
uh grip the sword and I don't have to
give it any input because I'm in the y

1184
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
give it any input because I'm in the y
 

1185
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,110
give it any input because I'm in the y
space so that's that's why I do this

1186
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
space so that's that's why I do this
 

1187
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,710
space so that's that's why I do this
okay and it helps gain sensitivity

1188
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,720
okay and it helps gain sensitivity
 

1189
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,509
okay and it helps gain sensitivity
because when I flex like this I can't

1190
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
because when I flex like this I can't
 

1191
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,710
because when I flex like this I can't
tell what is going on okay so one boom

1192
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
tell what is going on okay so one boom
 

1193
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,070
tell what is going on okay so one boom
pop boom

1194
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
pop boom
 

1195
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:38,350
pop boom
boom

1196
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:38,360

 

1197
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,789

and you if you pay attention I did that

1198
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
and you if you pay attention I did that
 

1199
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,990
and you if you pay attention I did that
spir rotation on the on my left side

1200
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,000
spir rotation on the on my left side
 

1201
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,350
spir rotation on the on my left side
boom and I'm going to do it on the right

1202
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,360
boom and I'm going to do it on the right
 

1203
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:56,029
boom and I'm going to do it on the right
side and it's the same

1204
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:56,039

 

1205
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,669

strategy

1206
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
strategy
 

1207
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,509
strategy
as soon as you ski you should just come

1208
00:32:59,509 --> 00:32:59,519
as soon as you ski you should just come
 

1209
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,909
as soon as you ski you should just come
back in right you it's not a matter of

1210
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
back in right you it's not a matter of
 

1211
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,950
back in right you it's not a matter of
coming fast it's not hanging out in the

1212
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:03,960
coming fast it's not hanging out in the
 

1213
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,549
coming fast it's not hanging out in the
back stance it's a matter of not just

1214
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
back stance it's a matter of not just
 

1215
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,590
back stance it's a matter of not just
getting r that

1216
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:10,600

 

1217
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:23,909

pause there you

1218
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919

 

1219
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:31,230

go getting burn more your tension

1220
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,240

 

1221
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,430

that's really trying to kill you or is
 

1277
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,510
that's really trying to kill you or is
much stronger than you then you realize

1278
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,520
much stronger than you then you realize
 

1279
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,670
much stronger than you then you realize
why you have have to do it okay and then

1280
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,680
why you have have to do it okay and then
 

1281
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,150
why you have have to do it okay and then
the same thing here is he comes around

1282
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,160
the same thing here is he comes around
 

1283
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,510
the same thing here is he comes around
and he goes it's very tempting to just

1284
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:04,520
and he goes it's very tempting to just
 

1285
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,470
and he goes it's very tempting to just
go like that do you get it and you don't

1286
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
go like that do you get it and you don't
 

1287
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,990
go like that do you get it and you don't
want to do that pay attention to the yin

1288
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
want to do that pay attention to the yin
 

1289
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,829
want to do that pay attention to the yin
space that is going to be generated and

1290
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:12,839
space that is going to be generated and
 

1291
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,109
space that is going to be generated and
I should try to fill that Yin space okay

1292
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:16,119
I should try to fill that Yin space okay
 

1293
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,630
I should try to fill that Yin space okay
so as uh you're here pop good show

1294
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
so as uh you're here pop good show
 

1295
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,630
so as uh you're here pop good show
around then he brings the weapon back

1296
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:23,640
around then he brings the weapon back
 

1297
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,510
around then he brings the weapon back
there's no reason why I should come back

1298
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
there's no reason why I should come back
 

1299
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,109
there's no reason why I should come back
and wait for that weapon to go I don't

1300
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
and wait for that weapon to go I don't
 

1301
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,109
and wait for that weapon to go I don't
know where that weapon is going to go DC

1302
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
know where that weapon is going to go DC
 

1303
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,589
know where that weapon is going to go DC
at this point I can't tell if that

1304
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
at this point I can't tell if that
 

1305
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,589
at this point I can't tell if that
thing's going to go jodon Chon or gidon

1306
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:34,599
thing's going to go jodon Chon or gidon
 

1307
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,470
thing's going to go jodon Chon or gidon
you get it or shci or whatever so what

1308
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:37,480
you get it or shci or whatever so what
 

1309
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,190
you get it or shci or whatever so what
you would do is let's rewind the film a

1310
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,200
you would do is let's rewind the film a
 

1311
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,510
you would do is let's rewind the film a
little okay eventually I'm on the other

1312
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
little okay eventually I'm on the other
 

1313
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,470
little okay eventually I'm on the other
side of his of this weapon over here so

1314
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
side of his of this weapon over here so
 

1315
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,870
side of his of this weapon over here so
you always follow it into its

1316
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
you always follow it into its
 

1317
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,710
you always follow it into its
source that's what you're doing here do

1318
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:51,720
source that's what you're doing here do
 

1319
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,270
source that's what you're doing here do
you get it okay so if I follow it into

1320
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,280
you get it okay so if I follow it into
 

1321
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,990
you get it okay so if I follow it into
the source I fill the in space and now I

1322
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,000
the source I fill the in space and now I
 

1323
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,150
the source I fill the in space and now I
obey the angle deviation angle

1324
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,160
obey the angle deviation angle
 

1325
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,589
obey the angle deviation angle
deflection rule so I'm going to move

1326
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:03,599
deflection rule so I'm going to move
 

1327
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,589
deflection rule so I'm going to move
this way as you start to ski and that's

1328
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:06,599
this way as you start to ski and that's
 

1329
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,069
this way as you start to ski and that's
how I make that initial cross I don't

1330
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
how I make that initial cross I don't
 

1331
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,230
how I make that initial cross I don't
leave it all open and hit it and I don't

1332
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,240
leave it all open and hit it and I don't
 

1333
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,109
leave it all open and hit it and I don't
let it get all the way out here and then

1334
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:14,119
let it get all the way out here and then
 

1335
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,950
let it get all the way out here and then
I hit it

1336
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:16,960
I hit it
 

1337
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,589
I hit it
okay so let me show the mistake that I'm

1338
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
okay so let me show the mistake that I'm
 

1339
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,790
okay so let me show the mistake that I'm
trying to get you to understand one two

back up okay so if I followed it

1360
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
back up okay so if I followed it
 

1361
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,470
back up okay so if I followed it
in there's no way I'm going to be here

then is the cut okay try to obviously we
went ahead from the releaseing

1384
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
went ahead from the releaseing
 

1385
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,910
went ahead from the releaseing
sensitivity drill and we did do um we

sensitivity drill and we did do um we
 

1387
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,150
sensitivity drill and we did do um we
introduced move five okay is it five I'm

s the makios on the Joe and because I

1396
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
s the makios on the Joe and because I
 

1397
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,790
s the makios on the Joe and because I
still want to do the releasing Dr okay

1398
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
still want to do the releasing Dr okay
 

1399
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,030
still want to do the releasing Dr okay
and I'm trying to give you more

1400
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
and I'm trying to give you more
 

1401
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,630
and I'm trying to give you more
understanding of what is going on um in

1402
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
understanding of what is going on um in
 

1403
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,150
understanding of what is going on um in
the book and I allowed my grip in the

1404
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
the book and I allowed my grip in the
 

1405
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,270
the book and I allowed my grip in the
releasing drill to be very loose I'm

1406
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
releasing drill to be very loose I'm
 

1407
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,950
releasing drill to be very loose I'm
barely touching it in the Joe I'm going

1408
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
barely touching it in the Joe I'm going
 

1409
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,750
barely touching it in the Joe I'm going
to just hold one end okay and here's why

1410
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:24,760
to just hold one end okay and here's why
 

1411
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,950
to just hold one end okay and here's why
this works if I I am adhering and

1412
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
this works if I I am adhering and
 

1413
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,710
this works if I I am adhering and
letting him move me from

1414
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
letting him move me from
 

1415
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,109
letting him move me from
y if I'm adhering to his Joe at the

1416
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:36,119
y if I'm adhering to his Joe at the
 

1417
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,630
y if I'm adhering to his Joe at the
cross when he SP rotates it I should

1418
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:39,640
cross when he SP rotates it I should
 

1419
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,790
cross when he SP rotates it I should
stay

1420
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
stay
 

1421
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,790
stay
adhere and when I spir rotated back from

1422
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:45,800
adhere and when I spir rotated back from
 

1423
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,990
adhere and when I spir rotated back from
my yin to back to my y I don't need to

1424
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,000
my yin to back to my y I don't need to
 

1425
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,990
my yin to back to my y I don't need to
hold the Jo the cross is holding the Jo

1426
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
hold the Jo the cross is holding the Jo
 

1427
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,510
hold the Jo the cross is holding the Jo
up okay so that's what we're going to do

1428
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
up okay so that's what we're going to do
