1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:36,229

so

2
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239

 

3
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:50,709

so

4
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719

 

5
00:00:50,719 --> 00:01:01,830

so

6
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840

 

7
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:21,830

uh

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840

 

9
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,830

the first one is not our

10
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
the first one is not our
 

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
the first one is not our
manipulation i'm not doing this

12
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
manipulation i'm not doing this
 

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,190
manipulation i'm not doing this
the first line is absorb

14
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
the first line is absorb
 

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,510
the first line is absorb
and then

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
and then
 

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,069
and then
right back in just like this

18
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079

 

19
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,510

doesn't matter where my hands are

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
doesn't matter where my hands are
 

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,830
doesn't matter where my hands are
because i can't really try to manipulate

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
because i can't really try to manipulate
 

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,789
because i can't really try to manipulate
the arm

24
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
the arm
 

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,870
the arm
i just have them in open end triangles

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
i just have them in open end triangles
 

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,190
i just have them in open end triangles
here's where i step and now you can see

28
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
here's where i step and now you can see
 

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,830
here's where i step and now you can see
the grip is

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
the grip is
 

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,709
the grip is
weak that's when you deal with the grip

32
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
weak that's when you deal with the grip
 

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,389
weak that's when you deal with the grip
so you're not going here

34
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
so you're not going here
 

35
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,709
so you're not going here
and trying to turn this

36
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
and trying to turn this
 

37
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,149
and trying to turn this
have a strong anchored elbow

38
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
have a strong anchored elbow
 

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,069
have a strong anchored elbow
i'm not gonna be able to do it and

40
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
i'm not gonna be able to do it and
 

41
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,389
i'm not gonna be able to do it and
you're gonna punch me in the face you

42
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
you're gonna punch me in the face you
 

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,749
you're gonna punch me in the face you
see

44
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
see
 

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,949
see
so

46
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
so
 

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,910
so
off

48
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
off
 

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,750
off
right

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
right
 

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,390
right
okay and then the grip is weakened

52
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
okay and then the grip is weakened
 

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,070
okay and then the grip is weakened
then you finally

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080

 

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:35,910

so absorb

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920

 

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,640

here

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:40,650

 

59
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:57,750

[Music]

60
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760

 

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,630

so inside the keyhole rituals there's a

62
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
so inside the keyhole rituals there's a
 

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,149
so inside the keyhole rituals there's a
strategy

64
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
strategy
 

65
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,190
strategy
okay

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
okay
 

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,509
okay
and the strategy is

68
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
and the strategy is
 

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,110
and the strategy is
uh first control the body okay

70
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
uh first control the body okay
 

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,990
uh first control the body okay
um do not control

72
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
um do not control
 

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,190
um do not control
for example the extremity to control the

74
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
for example the extremity to control the
 

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,229
for example the extremity to control the
body

76
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
body
 

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,390
body
control the body and then you get the

78
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
control the body and then you get the
 

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,390
control the body and then you get the
extremity okay

80
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
extremity okay
 

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,990
extremity okay
so most of your

82
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
so most of your
 

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,430
so most of your
uh

84
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
uh
 

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,789
uh

mechanisms okay and they work with

186
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
mechanisms okay and they work with
 

187
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,029
mechanisms okay and they work with
energy and they don't work with fulcrums

188
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
energy and they don't work with fulcrums
 

189
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,950

and levels okay

and levels okay
 

191
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,629

but it's still an engine so there's

192
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
but it's still an engine so there's
 

193
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,629

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
forever all right do you understand that
 

199
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,230

uh a lot of it has to do like any engine

200
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240

man if you don't have good bolts

202
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
man if you don't have good bolts

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,310
man if you don't have good bolts
the bolts are going to come out you

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
the bolts are going to come out you

guess it has to do for example with the

206
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
guess it has to do for example with the
 

207
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,870
guess it has to do for example with the
quality of your organization

208
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880

209
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,670

okay

210
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
okay
 

211
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,749
okay
so uh how how how much stress your

212
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
so uh how how how much stress your
 

213
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,309
so uh how how how much stress your
organization can take has a lot to do

214
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
organization can take has a lot to do
 

215
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,430

with how much energy you can absorb and

216
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
with how much energy you can absorb and
 

217
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,909
with how much energy you can absorb and
bounce back off the ground okay so if i

218
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
bounce back off the ground okay so if i
 

219
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,150
bounce back off the ground okay so if i
have weak corners which you've all are

220
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
have weak corners which you've all are
 

221
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,710
have weak corners which you've all are
struggling with or have struggled with

222
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
struggling with or have struggled with
 

223
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,950

energy goes out the corner and you can't

224
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
energy goes out the corner and you can't
 

225
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,189
energy goes out the corner and you can't
do it you see but so there's always a

226
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
do it you see but so there's always a
 

227
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,909
do it you see but so there's always a
ceiling though on all of this but you

228
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
ceiling though on all of this but you
 

229
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,070
ceiling though on all of this but you
combine it with

230
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
combine it with
 

231
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,309
combine it with
your external movements do you

232
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
your external movements do you
 

233
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,710
your external movements do you
understand so you can't decrease how

234
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
understand so you can't decrease how
 

235
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,909

much energy the person is putting into

you
 

239
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,070
you
uh so for example when i go here that's

240
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
uh so for example when i go here that's
 

241
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,390
uh so for example when i go here that's
going to be a lot of energy

242
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
going to be a lot of energy
 

243
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,870
going to be a lot of energy
do you see that because i i'm

244
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
do you see that because i i'm
 

245
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,309
do you see that because i i'm

you see that but if i if i have good

a ceiling that is higher than my work

256
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
a ceiling that is higher than my work
 

257
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,150

output ceiling do you understand so when

258
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
output ceiling do you understand so when
 

259
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,790
output ceiling do you understand so when
you feel what you're feeling for is that

263
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,110

and with that

264
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
and with that
 

265
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,510
and with that
i still have my kazushi pattern

266
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
i still have my kazushi pattern
 

267
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,950
i still have my kazushi pattern
he's going this way

268
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960

 

269
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,670

because it takes more energy

270
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
because it takes more energy
 

271
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,830
