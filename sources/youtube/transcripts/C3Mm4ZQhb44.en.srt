169
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,370
body I'm in the in the internal field
the lower tonden I am going to circulate

170
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,380
the lower tonden I am going to circulate
 

171
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,749
the lower tonden I am going to circulate
it and prolong its presence in my body

172
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
it and prolong its presence in my body
 

173
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,950
it and prolong its presence in my body
so I'm I am going back but it's for the

174
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:03,960
so I'm I am going back but it's for the
 

175
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,689
so I'm I am going back but it's for the
purposes of circulating that pressure

176
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:07,699
purposes of circulating that pressure
 

177
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:14,390
purposes of circulating that pressure
that she in my body oh

178
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400

 

179
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,990

meaning it's not for leverage so I don't

180
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
meaning it's not for leverage so I don't
 

181
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,590
meaning it's not for leverage so I don't
need any leverage because his energy is

182
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
need any leverage because his energy is
 

183
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,010
need any leverage because his energy is
not here at the risk his energy is

184
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
not here at the risk his energy is
 

185
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,770
not here at the risk his energy is
pressurized uh and bouncing off the

186
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:27,780
pressurized uh and bouncing off the
 

187
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,249
pressurized uh and bouncing off the
Earth so I can throw from here just as

188
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,259
Earth so I can throw from here just as
 

189
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,550
Earth so I can throw from here just as
easily as I had thrown from here as

190
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
easily as I had thrown from here as
 

191
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,230
easily as I had thrown from here as
gookin okay

192
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240

 

193
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,050

likewise when I go back I don't have to

194
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,060
likewise when I go back I don't have to
 

195
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,629
likewise when I go back I don't have to
worry about how far I go back in terms

196
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
worry about how far I go back in terms
 

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,570
worry about how far I go back in terms
of Leverage and things like that uh

198
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,580
of Leverage and things like that uh
 

199
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,870
of Leverage and things like that uh
because it's not like I would lose the

200
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
because it's not like I would lose the
 

201
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,510
because it's not like I would lose the
ability to internalize his energy so

202
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
ability to internalize his energy so
 

203
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,050
ability to internalize his energy so
this is pretty far back I would say and

204
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,060
this is pretty far back I would say and
 

205
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,810
this is pretty far back I would say and
he pushes he's not going to push me

fix them in the form
to me it is the same thing if I have a

296
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:07,139
to me it is the same thing if I have a
 

297
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,689
to me it is the same thing if I have a
spotter

298
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:08,699
spotter
 

299
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,870
spotter
and their spot me on bench press they're

300
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
and their spot me on bench press they're
 

301
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,790
and their spot me on bench press they're
supposed to help me bring that barbell

302
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:13,800
supposed to help me bring that barbell
 

303
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,249
supposed to help me bring that barbell
out to my nipple line they're not

304
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:16,259
out to my nipple line they're not
 

305
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,650
out to my nipple line they're not
supposed to Chuck it towards my feet and

306
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:18,660
supposed to Chuck it towards my feet and
 

307
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,010
supposed to Chuck it towards my feet and
then I show through my ego attachment

308
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,020
then I show through my ego attachment
 

309
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,990
then I show through my ego attachment
that I can hold it on the nipple line

310
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
that I can hold it on the nipple line
 

311
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,330
that I can hold it on the nipple line
you're not a good spotter

have to stop him from doing it so he
 

345
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,090
have to stop him from doing it so he
goes and I am doing the same Coke you

you throw them and then they kind of

360
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,100
you throw them and then they kind of
 

361
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,470
you throw them and then they kind of
come up do you see like that okay well

362
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,480
come up do you see like that okay well
 

363
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,350
come up do you see like that okay well
if he's gonna change the rules you can

364
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
if he's gonna change the rules you can
 

365
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,850
if he's gonna change the rules you can
still do Coke you home he goes up and he

366
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,860
still do Coke you home he goes up and he
 

367
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,430
still do Coke you home he goes up and he
can't he can't ever get down he can't

368
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,440
can't he can't ever get down he can't
 

369
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,710
can't he can't ever get down he can't
get down he can't get in a position to

370
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
get down he can't get in a position to
 

371
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,430
get down he can't get in a position to
do this so I will uh hyper-exaggerate it

372
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,440
do this so I will uh hyper-exaggerate it
 

373
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,530
do this so I will uh hyper-exaggerate it
let's say he goes up

374
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
let's say he goes up
 

375
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,930
let's say he goes up
and he go he's going to drop his weight

376
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
and he go he's going to drop his weight
 

377
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,030
and he go he's going to drop his weight
uh into season

378
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
uh into season
 

379
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,630
uh into season
see that kind of thing you get that

380
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
see that kind of thing you get that
 

381
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,090
see that kind of thing you get that
um the same thing he goes up he can't

382
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
um the same thing he goes up he can't
 

383
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,070
um the same thing he goes up he can't
get down

384
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,080
get down
 

385
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,110
get down
don't let him down if you don't want to

386
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
don't let him down if you don't want to
 

387
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,630
don't let him down if you don't want to
or you combine

388
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
or you combine
 

389
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,009
or you combine
the uh internal and the external so he

390
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,019
the uh internal and the external so he
 

391
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,170
the uh internal and the external so he
goes right and pull me and you come

392
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,180
goes right and pull me and you come
 

393
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,550
goes right and pull me and you come
around

394
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
around
 

395
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,889
around
so we'll do that slower so you can see

396
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:27,899
so we'll do that slower so you can see
 

397
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,550
so we'll do that slower so you can see
it go slower he's got his weight well I

398
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:31,560
it go slower he's got his weight well I
 

399
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,550
it go slower he's got his weight well I
will externally yield and then go back

400
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
will externally yield and then go back
 

401
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,250
will externally yield and then go back
to the external project question as I

402
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,260
to the external project question as I
 

403
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,590
to the external project question as I
load the hand for the Coq

404
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600

 

405
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,050

that doesn't change

406
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,060

 

407
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,530

he goes to show my hands down

408
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,540
he goes to show my hands down
 

409
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,750
he goes to show my hands down
the same thing you don't you don't have

410
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
the same thing you don't you don't have
 

411
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,530
the same thing you don't you don't have
to let your hands get there okay so

412
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,540
to let your hands get there okay so
 

413
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,630
to let your hands get there okay so
first Solutions tell them to train

414
00:10:59,630 --> 00:10:59,640
first Solutions tell them to train
 

415
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,769
first Solutions tell them to train
correctly second solutions would be uh

416
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:03,779
correctly second solutions would be uh
 

417
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,410
correctly second solutions would be uh
do an external yield to that and then go

418
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:06,420
do an external yield to that and then go
 

419
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,009
do an external yield to that and then go
back to an internal projection and then

420
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:10,019
back to an internal projection and then
 

421
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,509
back to an internal projection and then
um I'm sorry the second solution was

422
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
um I'm sorry the second solution was
 

423
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,829
um I'm sorry the second solution was
don't let them ever get down you can

424
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
don't let them ever get down you can
 

425
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,290
don't let them ever get down you can
hold them up with Coq okay then the

426
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,300
hold them up with Coq okay then the
 

427
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,050
hold them up with Coq okay then the
third solution was an external yield and

428
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,060
third solution was an external yield and
 

429
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,410
third solution was an external yield and
Then followed by an internal projection

430
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,420
Then followed by an internal projection
 

431
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,829

I don't think you're doing Coq hole at

440
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:31,019
I don't think you're doing Coq hole at
 

441

this point
 

443
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,269
this point
so you'll find people

444
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
so you'll find people
 

445
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,490
so you'll find people
go ahead and push and they'll do all

446
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:37,500
go ahead and push and they'll do all
 

447
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,430
go ahead and push and they'll do all
kinds of little leverage tricks so he's

448
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,440
kinds of little leverage tricks so he's
 

449
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,910
kinds of little leverage tricks so he's
pushing and uh I can just get so much

450
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
pushing and uh I can just get so much
 

451
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,509
pushing and uh I can just get so much
torque here that I'm out do you see and

452
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
torque here that I'm out do you see and
 

453
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,850
torque here that I'm out do you see and
go let's have you just stay there push

454
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:49,860
go let's have you just stay there push
 

455
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,130

459
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,590
much torque here that I'm out and stay
there where you are I'm gonna move out

460
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
there where you are I'm gonna move out
 

461
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,090
there where you are I'm gonna move out
from under you stay exactly where you

462
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,100
from under you stay exactly where you

are his body shifted slightly to the

464
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:01,800
are his body shifted slightly to the
 

465
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,690
are his body shifted slightly to the
left

466
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:02,700

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,380
go back
 

469
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,250
go back
so as his body shifted just ever so

470
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,260
so as his body shifted just ever so
 

471
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,670
so as his body shifted just ever so
slightly again then you can project on

472
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,680
slightly again then you can project on
 

473
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,769
slightly again then you can project on
this side so you're here

474
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:14,779

 

475
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,490

or
 

477
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,690
or
oh you're down here he's got it uh with

478
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:20,700
oh you're down here he's got it uh with
 

479
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,530
oh you're down here he's got it uh with
relaxed tension-free movement he can't

480
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:24,540
relaxed tension-free movement he can't
 

481
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,389
relaxed tension-free movement he can't
he can't hold me down

482
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
he can't hold me down
 

483
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,610
he can't hold me down
there's just no way he's you really got

484
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:28,620
there's just no way he's you really got
 

485
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,030
there's just no way he's you really got
it and I just kind of lift my hands up

486
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
it and I just kind of lift my hands up
 

487
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,590
it and I just kind of lift my hands up
and

488

and
 

489
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,069
and
back in that so he can be standing on it

490
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
back in that so he can be standing on it
 

491
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,009
back in that so he can be standing on it
and he has lots of weight he might try

492
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,019
