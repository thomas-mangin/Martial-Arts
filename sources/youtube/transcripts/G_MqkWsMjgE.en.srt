176
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
down fast
 

177
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,949
down fast
and to the point

178
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
and to the point
 

179
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,670
and to the point
everybody's aikido works because it's

180
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
everybody's aikido works because it's
 

181
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,110
everybody's aikido works because it's
their aikido

182
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
their aikido
 

183
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,630
their aikido
they adopt it to

184
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640

 

185
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,030

to make it work with their body

186
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
to make it work with their body
 

187
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,429
to make it work with their body
but if you have

188
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
but if you have
 

189
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,309
but if you have
this receiving blade here it still

190
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
this receiving blade here it still
 

191
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,509
this receiving blade here it still
receives it this this will be more of a

192
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
receives it this this will be more of a
 

193
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,630
receives it this this will be more of a
block

194
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
block
 

195
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,589
block
so it's

196
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
so it's
 

197
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,030
so it's
them against you if you do it this way

198
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
them against you if you do it this way
 

199
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,149
them against you if you do it this way
then what happens is if you're

200
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:13,159
then what happens is if you're
 

201
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,110
then what happens is if you're
sensitivity is correct it can actually

202
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
sensitivity is correct it can actually
 

203
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,270
sensitivity is correct it can actually
fold when it hits

204
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
fold when it hits
 

205
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,030
fold when it hits
when they come together can fold and

206
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
when they come together can fold and
 

207
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,710
when they come together can fold and
then you can just close your grip

208
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
then you can just close your grip
 

209
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,870
then you can just close your grip
and it becomes a natural gripping on

210
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
and it becomes a natural gripping on
 

211
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,870
and it becomes a natural gripping on
their wrist

212
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
their wrist
 

213
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,629
their wrist
or the other hand

214
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639

 

215
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,670

can be

216
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
can be
 

217
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,270
can be
naturally

218
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
naturally
 

219
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,469
naturally
molded

220
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
molded
 

221
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,629
molded
to grip their elbow

222
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639

 

223
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,909

so so to me both are correct but the

224
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
so so to me both are correct but the
 

225
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,550
so so to me both are correct but the
honbu style akido is more sensitive

226
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
honbu style akido is more sensitive
 

227
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,230
honbu style akido is more sensitive
and a lot of the uh iwama

228
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
and a lot of the uh iwama
 

229
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,909

people
 

231
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,310
people
they're so strict in their mind and

232
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
they're so strict in their mind and
 

233
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,469
they're so strict in their mind and
stubborn would say that they're not

00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
stubborn would say that they're not
 

235
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,510
stubborn would say that they're not
looking at flexibility

236
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
looking at flexibility
 

237
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,550
looking at flexibility
the flexibility of the mind and and the

238
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
the flexibility of the mind and and the
 

239
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,350
the flexibility of the mind and and the
science of how we have to change if i

240
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
science of how we have to change if i
 

241
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,710
science of how we have to change if i
just turn on my chair

242
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720

 

243
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,790

and i keep turning on my chair apart

244
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
and i keep turning on my chair apart
 

245
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,830
and i keep turning on my chair apart
from the noise

246
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840

 

247
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,029

and i put this hand out but i turn as i

248
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
and i put this hand out but i turn as i
 

249
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,390
and i put this hand out but i turn as i
turn on my chair you see

250
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
turn on my chair you see
 

251
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,469
turn on my chair you see
it becomes flat

252
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
it becomes flat
 

253
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,029
it becomes flat
so sometimes entering if it if you're

254
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
so sometimes entering if it if you're
 

255
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,430
so sometimes entering if it if you're
entering xiaomi chi icchio

256
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440

 

257
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,990

as long as your body

258
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
as long as your body
 

259
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,189
as long as your body
will

260
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
will
 

261
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,310
will
make if this is the central point when

262
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
make if this is the central point when
 

263
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,629
make if this is the central point when
it comes once it comes together

264
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
it comes once it comes together
 

265
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,990
it comes once it comes together
if you move your body around

266
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000

 

267
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,110

then the hand doesn't move so much

268
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
then the hand doesn't move so much
 

269
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,350
then the hand doesn't move so much
obviously the fulcrum your body's on a

270
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
obviously the fulcrum your body's on a
 

271
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,150
obviously the fulcrum your body's on a
much larger fulcrum than the

272
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
much larger fulcrum than the
 

273
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,950
much larger fulcrum than the
than the hand is

274
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
than the hand is
 

275
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,909
than the hand is
but the hand will

276
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
but the hand will
 

277
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,150
but the hand will
so i'm turning now and i'm turning i'm

278
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
so i'm turning now and i'm turning i'm
 

279
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,710
so i'm turning now and i'm turning i'm
turning and turning

281
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,870

so so scent sensitivity and body science

282
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
so so scent sensitivity and body science
 

283
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,870
so so scent sensitivity and body science
so the body sounds to me

284
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
so the body sounds to me
 

285
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,990
so the body sounds to me
when i was training anywhere

when i was training anywhere
 

287
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,070
when i was training anywhere
only for a short period but when i was

288
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
only for a short period but when i was
 

289
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,749
only for a short period but when i was
trying there

290
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
trying there
 

291
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,029
trying there
i met a third dan

292
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
i met a third dan
 

293
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,430
i met a third dan
and he was to me the carbon copy of

294
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
and he was to me the carbon copy of
 

295
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,430
and he was to me the carbon copy of
cytosensei

296
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
cytosensei
 

297
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,110
cytosensei
he looked

298
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
he looked
 

299
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,790
he looked
exactly

300
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
exactly
 

301
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,270
exactly
in action and if it was a slight

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
in action and if it was a slight
 

303
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,510

distance away from you perhaps doing the
 

305
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,430

weapons in the morning

306
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
weapons in the morning
 

307
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,189
weapons in the morning
um

308
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
um
 

309
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,790
um
you would actually

310
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
you would actually
 

311
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,590
you would actually
need to take a second glance because it

312
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
need to take a second glance because it
 

313
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,430
need to take a second glance because it
he was so much like santos sensei you

314
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
he was so much like santos sensei you
 

315
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,070
he was so much like santos sensei you
thought that he was him

thought that he was him
 

317
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,110
thought that he was him
but what i found by practicing with him

318
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
but what i found by practicing with him

he was more like a marshmallow than her
 

321
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,550
he was more like a marshmallow than her
than a human being

i call body science
we learn to

336
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
we learn to
 

337
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,150
we learn to
move

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
the impact of where the power needs to
 

347
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,230
the impact of where the power needs to
be placed and the part that receives

348

be placed and the part that receives
 

349
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,309

if the person pushes we may withdraw but

352
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
if the person pushes we may withdraw but
 

353
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,390
if the person pushes we may withdraw but
we might turn as we withdraw

354
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
we might turn as we withdraw
 

355
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,909
we might turn as we withdraw
hence you get

356
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
hence you get
 

357
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,150
hence you get
an error equal

358
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160

but
a lot of the people

366
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
a lot of the people
 

367
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,230
a lot of the people
