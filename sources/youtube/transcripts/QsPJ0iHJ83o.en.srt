you guys see that okay so I'll do the
other way you're over here and you enter

other way you're over here and you enter
 

7

other way you're over here and you enter
and then you turn

this one I'm going to use the spiral of

you just forward progress

26
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,640
you just forward progress
 

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,149
you just forward progress
to keep the spiral

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159

around here yeah that's she you can do

36
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,240
around here yeah that's she you can do

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,929
around here yeah that's she you can do
shihonaga there you see

so this hand I keep going around it

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,420

 

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,229

43
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,750

so you have to keep it going around all

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
so you have to keep it going around all
 

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,210
so you have to keep it going around all

you're making what's going forward

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:27,900
you're making what's going forward
 

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,470
you're making what's going forward

don't don't smell it and come here hi

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:45,300
don't don't smell it and come here hi
 

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,350
don't don't smell it and come here hi
keep him going around

56
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,360
keep him going around
 

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,190
keep him going around
and then now it's going backwards good

58
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
and then now it's going backwards good
 

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,729
and then now it's going backwards good
okay but you have to move with this

60
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:55,739
okay but you have to move with this
 

61
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,589
okay but you have to move with this
so you have to go around I can't go here

62
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
so you have to go around I can't go here
 

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,530
so you have to go around I can't go here
I go here where the hand is hi you see

64
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:03,540
I go here where the hand is hi you see
 

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:12,369
I go here where the hand is hi you see
now it's going back

66
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:12,379

 

67
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,890

it was going forward but once we do the

68
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:15,900
it was going forward but once we do the
 

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,910
it was going forward but once we do the
spiral forward will become backwards so

70
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
spiral forward will become backwards so
 

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,509
spiral forward will become backwards so
what you don't do is bring his hand like

72
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
what you don't do is bring his hand like
 

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,009
what you don't do is bring his hand like
this

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,809
this
thing

76
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:26,819
thing
 

77
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,509
thing
you make his hand go

78
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
you make his hand go
 

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,190
you make his hand go
like this

80
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
like this
 

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,589
like this
this hand keeps going like that on a

82
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
this hand keeps going like that on a
 

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,630
this hand keeps going like that on a
smaller Circle and that's how it gets

84
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:35,640
smaller Circle and that's how it gets
 

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,509
smaller Circle and that's how it gets
there okay do you see that so it's not

86
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
there okay do you see that so it's not
 

87
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,170
there okay do you see that so it's not
that I go here and then I make his hand

88
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,180
that I go here and then I make his hand
 

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,809
that I go here and then I make his hand
go like that

90
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:44,819
go like that
 

91
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,509
go like that
I make his hand make a circle around

92
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
I make his hand make a circle around
 

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,830
I make his hand make a circle around
itself and then it gets there

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840

 

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,949

so it keeps going around

96
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959

 

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,780

he's gonna go around

98
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:08,790

okay
 

103
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,629
