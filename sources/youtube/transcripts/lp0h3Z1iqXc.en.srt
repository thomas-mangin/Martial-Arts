1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000


2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Today's theme will be "generosity".

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,581
What do I mean by that?

4
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:28,856
Aikido is a modern budo, right?

5
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:32,460
So it's a way for the betterment of human beings.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:41,391
What it means is that our thoughts, our words, and our actions should be one and the same,

7
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:45,010
so there ought to be no need to talk during practice.

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,613
Just focus on the technique.

9
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:54,156
When you practice, give it 100%. This is "generosity".

10
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:57,656
Give a 100% to your partner.

11
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:02,863
Given a 100% when you are tori, 

12
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:08,228
perform your best and your most pleasant technique.

13
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:14,392
When you take ukemi, take you best ukemi,

14
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:16,392
help you partner.

15
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:19,194
That's about it.

16
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:23,547
My technique is very simple, so it'll be easy.

17
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,561
Mihaly, please.

18
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,928
Do the biggest technique possible.

19
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:41,405
Open, open.

20
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,491
No jerky movements like that.

21
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:50,701
Open your partner's body.

22
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,161
Don't use severe techniques.

23
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,471
You can take back falls or break falls, whichever.

24
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:15,779
Do this technique in your own way, but please give that feeling to your partner. 

25
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:21,167
Open the body of the partner.

26
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,814
Slowly is fine.

27
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,610
That's it, do the biggest movement possible.

28
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:56,910
When you take ukemi, keep the contact until the end.

29
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't mean hold stiffly, but hold until the end.

30
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,546
Not like this.

31
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,887
Not like this either.

32
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,541
But until the end.

33
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,185
You don't even have to hold strongly, just keep the contact.

34
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:32,033
Not like this, all stiff.

35
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,549
Same thing if you take ushiro ukemi.

36
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,247
Stay until the end.

37
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,690
Is that OK? A bit more please.

38
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:41,334
The movement is a bit like when you're swimming at the pool.

39
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,916
I'm bigger than you so do a larger movement.

40
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,824
Yes, like this.

41
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:50,494
Do is softly.

42
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,110
Not like this.

43
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:04,837
Establish the contact, and move your whole body as a single unit.

44
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,494
Stay soft.

45
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:35,176
You can be strong, but stay soft.

46
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,338
Strong and stiff aren't the same thing.

47
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Hold strong.

48
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:48,425
If I tell him to hold strong, I'll immediately see tension in his shoulder and elbow, and they won't be as mobile.

49
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:55,346
The muscles that move the hand are connected up to the forearm, not higher.

50
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:58,226
This and this, it's completely independent.

51
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:06,408
Here, I'm stiff, everything is locked.

52
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,878
Here I'm strong,

53
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,139
I use only those (forearm) muscles.

54
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,350
[Move any way you like.]

55
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:22,247
Look at my shoulder,

56
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,636
the elbow and the shoulder stay soft.

57
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,636
This is being strong.

58
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,361
Make a clear difference between strong and stiff.

59
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:34,233
During practice, we often mean to hold strong but we end up stiffening.

60
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,138
We stiffen in our mind too.

61
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,412
Grab as strongly as possible,

62
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:44,458
but keep the rest relaxed.

63
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:59,668
Do you understand?

64
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,618
Whether you take ukemi or whether you do the technique, it should be the same thing.

65
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,619
Not like this.

66
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Gentle contact.

67
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:13,895
Same feeling as when you hold a baby.

68
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:18,172
Treat the partner as softly you would treat a baby.

69
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:31,026
I have the same feeling when I hold my own 2-months old baby.

70
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:38,487
This is what I call a generous technique.

71
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,111
Same thing as for before's technique.

72
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,121
Stay soft.

73
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:59,630
Strong is fine, but not stiff.

74
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,841
Same thing when you take ukemi.

75
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:11,169
Hold strong but keep a soft body.

76
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:27,287
Before, we just saw some demonstrations of koryu bujutsu.

77
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,300
Of course, Aikido comes from koryu bujutsu.

78
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:40,244
The Founder of Aikido learned Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu from Takeda Sokaku Sensei.

79
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:46,304
99% of aikido techniques come from Daito-ryu.

80
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:50,063
So you may be wondering: "What makes aikido different from Daito-ryu?"

81
00:10:55,807 --> 00:11:06,000
In Daito-ryu, you immobilize the enemy at your feet and you kill him.

82
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,974
Done!

83
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,090
You do not leave any way out to the partner.

84
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,090
In aikido, it's different!

85
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,001
Same attack.

86
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:23,445
Not this...

87
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:28,988
You provide a way out.

88
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,125
But it's a dangerous approach.

89
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:34,316
He could come and attack you again.

90
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:39,214
That's why I want to give him a pleasant feeling.

91
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:49,165
If you provide a soft feeling, a pleasant feeling,

92
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:54,000
there is a chance he might come back saying "Can we please do this again?"

93
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,509
That's the difference.

94
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,347
For instance on iriminage.

95
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,850
Don't do a harsh technique.

96
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:21,318
No need for this, nor this,

97
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:26,499
just this feeling.

98
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,128
Same thing for ushiro ukemi.

99
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:42,423
Soft.

100
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,941
Same as before, not like this,

101
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,622
like this.

102
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,785
I give him a way out, I give him an opportunity.

103
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:10,552
The goal is to make him move the way you want without telling him how to move.

104
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,562
Make it very clear.

105
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:34,123
This is the key for removing frustration during practice.

106
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,096
Do it a little bit bigger.

107
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,889
Because I'm taller than you.

108
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:42,061
Thank you.

109
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,129
The responsibility lies on tori.

110
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:48,461
The responsibility lies on tori.

111
00:14:51,421 --> 00:15:04,490
When I throw, I shouldn't throw there, right?

112
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:13,074
I want to go forward, but if this forward is too dangerous, I just change forward.

113
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:19,133
I don't want to see you do this.

114
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:23,357
I don't want to see this.

115
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,104
What does this way of taking ukemi mean?

116
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,311
It means that you don't trust tori.

117
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,622
Because you feel that you have to check where he sends you.

118
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,058
"Where are you throwing me?"

119
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,191
"Is it OK?"

120
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:34,648
It shouldn't be so.

121
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,398
I trust him.

122
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,718
The responsibility for my safety is on him.

123
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,433
There should be no need for this.

124
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,928
I'm not afraid.

125
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:52,928
I trust him so I'm not afraid.

126
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:07,422
I only look at him.

127
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:10,198
I keep the contact until the end.

128
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,060
Contact with the skin, and with the eyes.

129
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,910
[Let's do yokomenuchi]

130
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,349
It's the first time we meet, right?

131
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:38,887
We can communicate through the technique.

132
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:55,417
If you make a mistake, 

133
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:59,486
don't say "I'm sorry".

134
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:08,716
A real apology is made when you are being careful the next time around.

135
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,254
Same if you're too rough.

136
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,712
"Oops! Sorry!"

137
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,722
But then on the next technique...

138
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,723
"Oops, sorry!"

139
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,724
If you do it again, you didn't mean it.

140
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:28,267
If you make a mistake, be extra nice the next time around.

141
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:32,052
Say sorry with your body.

142
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:48,957
And from that point, you can try to find out how far he is able to go.

143
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:51,918
I don't know that yet, because we've just met.

144
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:53,401
I don't know how far he can go.

145
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,401
I don't know if he can take a break fall.

146
00:17:55,401 --> 00:18:03,220
So I will offer him a challenge little by little.

147
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:19,114
Build up the relationship.

148
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:23,080
Using your technique, while not saying anything.

149
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:29,255
If I take big steps like this, I'm really slow, right?

150
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:48,945
I'm bigger and heavier than him, right?

151
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:54,000
So I compensate with tsugi ashi.

152
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,603
Not too fast though, same speed.

153
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:05,347
It allows me to go anywhere, in any direction.

154
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:10,295
But if I do it like this, I'm late.

155
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:14,753
I get stuck.

156
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:19,572
So instead I do tsugi ashi.

157
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,491
Irimi tenkan, tenkan...

158
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,268
It gives me freedom.

159
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:46,255
I do tsugi ashi so it allows me to keep this vertical line.

160
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,255
Not like this.

161
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,256
It's the same for the technique we did before.

162
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,970
Not this.

163
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,178
Now my problem is to work out how far he can go.

164
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:21,560
How far can you go?

165
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,983
Do your best, don't give up.

166
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:28,045
Don't give up.

167
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:29,864
More.

168
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:33,907
Never give up.

169
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:37,096
Just one more.

170
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:40,544
Slowly, you can do it.

171
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:45,060
It's OK to slow down, just don't give up.

172
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:48,438
Very good, thank you.

173
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,439
Just slow down if you're tired.

174
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:27,908
Do whatever technique you like.

175
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:35,837
But stay strong and stay soft.

176
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,588
Some power is OK, but with kindness.

177
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,899
Not too fast.

178
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:49,103
How far can he go?

179
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,337
Are you tired yet?

180
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:51,897

181
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,130
There's one more class after this!

182
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:03,837
Do your best.

183
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:08,921
How far can you go?

184
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,650
Great! Your turn!

185
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:34,341
OK!

186
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:37,608
Dozo, whichever technique you like!

187
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:53,156
In koryu jujutsu, we close openings and create tensions.

188
00:22:56,156 --> 00:22:58,156
It's a little harsh.

189
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:16,100
In aikido, we do it much larger.

190
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:25,616
We give some space to the partner

191
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:29,092
so that he can unfold his own ukemi.

192
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,101
We allow him to remain in control of his own ukemi, that's the difference.

193
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:35,498
In Daito-ryu we don't give him any space, straight down.

194
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,162
In aikido we give him space purposefully

195
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:40,222
so it makes no sense to lock the technique.

196
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:45,300
Do not close you aikido techniques.

197
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:51,129
Give him a way out of the conflict, through the aikido technique.

198
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:53,242
Don't lock down.

199
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,668
Open the door.

200
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,550
Is it OK?

201
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,235
That's it.

202
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:21,761
The most important hand is the hand you don't see.

203
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:27,558
When people do this, everybody focuses on this hand, the one we see.

204
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,938
However, it's the hand we don't see that does most of the work.

205
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,982
It's more effective, right?

206
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,365
It's the same for this technique.

207
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,651
No need to chop like this, just use the thumb.

208
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,302
Thank you very much.
