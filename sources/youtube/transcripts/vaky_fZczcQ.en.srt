257
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,350
know if you are or not but nine out of
ten times you actually start pushing

258
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
ten times you actually start pushing
 

259
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,350
ten times you actually start pushing
more on the head because you've already

260
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
more on the head because you've already
 

261
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,189
more on the head because you've already
pushed on the arm without perhaps

262
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
pushed on the arm without perhaps
 

263
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,870
pushed on the arm without perhaps
knowing it

264
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
knowing it
 

265
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,749
knowing it
when the when you can get the same

266
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
when the when you can get the same
 

267
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,590
when the when you can get the same

the other no no
 

273
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,189
the other no no
all right

274
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
all right
 

275
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,310
all right
so he

276
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320

 

277
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,390
