going to be talking about the oh seikomi
waza so this is a continuation of our

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
waza so this is a continuation of our
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,669
waza so this is a continuation of our
kumiuchi series so we're covering all

8
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
kumiuchi series so we're covering all
 

9
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,910
kumiuchi series so we're covering all
the pieces of kumiuchi remember kumiuchi

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
the pieces of kumiuchi remember kumiuchi
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
the pieces of kumiuchi remember kumiuchi
means struggle and aikido ideally

12
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
means struggle and aikido ideally
 

13
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,070
means struggle and aikido ideally
kumiuchi is something we would like to

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
kumiuchi is something we would like to
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,230
kumiuchi is something we would like to
never do so we would like to never have

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
never do so we would like to never have
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,750
never do so we would like to never have
to use any of these things if we had

18
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
to use any of these things if we had
 

19
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,109
to use any of these things if we had
really good eye key we wouldn't have to

20
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
really good eye key we wouldn't have to
 

21
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,790
really good eye key we wouldn't have to
do any of this stuff but this is stuff

22
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
do any of this stuff but this is stuff
 

23
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,630
do any of this stuff but this is stuff
we're doing when our ikea is starting to

24
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
we're doing when our ikea is starting to
 

25
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,349
we're doing when our ikea is starting to
fail so osekomiwaza is something that if

26
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
fail so osekomiwaza is something that if
 

27
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,189
fail so osekomiwaza is something that if
you've been following my approach to

28
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
you've been following my approach to
 

29
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,589
you've been following my approach to
aikido you might say why would you even

30
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
aikido you might say why would you even
 

31
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,630
aikido you might say why would you even
put ose komiwaza in your aikido because

32
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
put ose komiwaza in your aikido because
 

33
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,630
put ose komiwaza in your aikido because
it's just pinning techniques and pinning

34
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
it's just pinning techniques and pinning
 

35
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,630
it's just pinning techniques and pinning
techniques are domination techniques and

36
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
techniques are domination techniques and
 

37
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,110
techniques are domination techniques and
you christopher hines say that aikido is

38
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
you christopher hines say that aikido is
 

39
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,510
you christopher hines say that aikido is
not about dominating it's about making a

40
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
not about dominating it's about making a
 

41
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,470
not about dominating it's about making a
chords

42
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
chords
 

43
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,549
chords
that is true but there are times where

44
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
that is true but there are times where
 

45
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,990
that is true but there are times where
we have to struggle that's what the

46
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
we have to struggle that's what the
 

47
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,150
we have to struggle that's what the
whole kumiuchi is about right so if we

48
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
whole kumiuchi is about right so if we
 

49
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,590
whole kumiuchi is about right so if we
could always make perfect ikey then we

50
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
could always make perfect ikey then we
 

51
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,709
could always make perfect ikey then we
wouldn't have to have anything in the

52
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
wouldn't have to have anything in the
 

53
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,790
wouldn't have to have anything in the
kumiuchi and osekomiwaza is just an

54
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
kumiuchi and osekomiwaza is just an
 

55
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,350
kumiuchi and osekomiwaza is just an
extension of that i think the

56
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,360
extension of that i think the
 

57
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,709
extension of that i think the
osekomewaza is in aikido to teach you

58
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
osekomewaza is in aikido to teach you
 

59
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,830
osekomewaza is in aikido to teach you
some very important things it's one how

60
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
some very important things it's one how
 

61
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,750
some very important things it's one how
to deal with taking down an armed person

62
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
to deal with taking down an armed person
 

63
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,990
to deal with taking down an armed person
and two and controlling the armed person

64
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
and two and controlling the armed person
 

65
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,950
and two and controlling the armed person
also and two how to deal with pinning

66
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
also and two how to deal with pinning
 

67
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,030
also and two how to deal with pinning
someone and there being other people

68
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
someone and there being other people
 

69
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,950
someone and there being other people
around who could come and get you so if

70
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
around who could come and get you so if
 

71
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,870
around who could come and get you so if
other people could come to get you how

72
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
other people could come to get you how
 

73
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,030
other people could come to get you how
would we pin someone right so there

74
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
would we pin someone right so there
 

75
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,789
would we pin someone right so there
might be times where you have to pin you

76
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
might be times where you have to pin you
 

77
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,469
might be times where you have to pin you
can't make the accord you want and so

78
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
can't make the accord you want and so
 

79
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,830
can't make the accord you want and so
you have to hold someone down and

80
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
you have to hold someone down and
 

81
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,070
you have to hold someone down and
dominate them but in aikido we always

82
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
dominate them but in aikido we always
 

83
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,830
dominate them but in aikido we always
want to do it in a way with thought

84
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
want to do it in a way with thought
 

85
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,149
want to do it in a way with thought
towards being autonomous

86
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
towards being autonomous
 

87
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,830
towards being autonomous
so i'm going to cover that stuff today

88
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
so i'm going to cover that stuff today
 

89
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,870
so i'm going to cover that stuff today
i'm going to show you all the different

90
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
i'm going to show you all the different
 

91
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,789
i'm going to show you all the different
little ideas about pinning and all the

92
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
little ideas about pinning and all the
 

93
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,230
little ideas about pinning and all the
different parts that come into pinning

94
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
different parts that come into pinning
 

95
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,350
different parts that come into pinning
i'm going to call my over here we're

96
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
i'm going to call my over here we're
 

97
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,710
i'm going to call my over here we're
going to go to work maya

98
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
going to go to work maya
 

99
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,069
going to go to work maya
all right so let's talk about ose

100
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
all right so let's talk about ose
 

101
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,429
all right so let's talk about ose
komiwaza

102
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
komiwaza
 

103
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,190
komiwaza
to me the osekome waza fits really

104
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
to me the osekome waza fits really
 

105
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,670
to me the osekome waza fits really
naturally in i think a lot of people

106
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
naturally in i think a lot of people
 

107
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,670
naturally in i think a lot of people
might say that that doesn't seem to fit

108
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
might say that that doesn't seem to fit
 

109
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,149
might say that that doesn't seem to fit
my approach and as i said in the in the

110
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
my approach and as i said in the in the
 

111
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,870
my approach and as i said in the in the
teaser in the beginning it's because

112
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
teaser in the beginning it's because
 

113
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,749
teaser in the beginning it's because
kumiuchi overall doesn't fit with the

114
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
kumiuchi overall doesn't fit with the
 

115
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,310
kumiuchi overall doesn't fit with the
ideal aikido situation

116
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
ideal aikido situation
 

117
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,709
ideal aikido situation
but like all good systems it's built to

118
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
but like all good systems it's built to
 

119
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,709
but like all good systems it's built to
deal with situations as they get worse

120
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
deal with situations as they get worse
 

121
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,789
deal with situations as they get worse
and worse and worse so meaning a bad

122
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
and worse and worse so meaning a bad
 

123
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,949
and worse and worse so meaning a bad
system can only deal with when things go

124
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
system can only deal with when things go
 

125
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,190
system can only deal with when things go
right right if they go wrong then a bad

126
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
right right if they go wrong then a bad
 

127
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,790
right right if they go wrong then a bad
system can't deal with that a good

128
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
system can't deal with that a good
 

129
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,030
system can't deal with that a good
system can deal with it going wrong and

130
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
system can deal with it going wrong and
 

131
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,949
system can deal with it going wrong and
wrong again and wrong again and wrong

132
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
wrong again and wrong again and wrong
 

133
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,309
wrong again and wrong again and wrong
again and wrong again that's what a

134
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
again and wrong again that's what a
 

135
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,350
again and wrong again that's what a
system does is it builds in redundancies

136
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
system does is it builds in redundancies
 

137
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,630
system does is it builds in redundancies
that help you get back to where you want

138
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
that help you get back to where you want
 

139
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,630
that help you get back to where you want
to be the difference in my approach to

140
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
to be the difference in my approach to
 

141
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,589
to be the difference in my approach to
aikido and maybe how it's commonly seen

142
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
aikido and maybe how it's commonly seen
 

143
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,470
aikido and maybe how it's commonly seen
is the goal in my idea of aikido the

144
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
is the goal in my idea of aikido the
 

145
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,630
is the goal in my idea of aikido the
goal is to make a chord right is to

146
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
goal is to make a chord right is to
 

147
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,550
goal is to make a chord right is to
peacefully resolve the situation now

148
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
peacefully resolve the situation now
 

149
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,750
peacefully resolve the situation now
there might have to be punching and

150
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
there might have to be punching and
 

151
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,350
there might have to be punching and
kicking and holding all kinds of stuff

152
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
kicking and holding all kinds of stuff
 

153
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,190
kicking and holding all kinds of stuff
to resolve the situation but the idea is

154
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
to resolve the situation but the idea is
 

155
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,390
to resolve the situation but the idea is
to get a

156
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
to get a
 

157
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,150
to get a
situation that's good for both of us as

158
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
situation that's good for both of us as
 

159
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
situation that's good for both of us as
good as it can possibly be

160
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
good as it can possibly be
 

161
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,990
good as it can possibly be

so with multiple attackers those kinds

276
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
so with multiple attackers those kinds
 

277
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,469
so with multiple attackers those kinds
of takedowns won't work either so what

278
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
of takedowns won't work either so what
 

279
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,710
of takedowns won't work either so what
aikido is teaching us to do is to deal

280
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
aikido is teaching us to do is to deal
 

281
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,629
aikido is teaching us to do is to deal
with situations and the takedowns that

282
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
with situations and the takedowns that
 

283
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,550
with situations and the takedowns that
we could possibly use for multiple

284
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
we could possibly use for multiple
 

285
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,030
we could possibly use for multiple
attackers and for armed people right so

286
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
attackers and for armed people right so
 

287
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,710
attackers and for armed people right so
meaning aikido i'm going to work of

288
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
meaning aikido i'm going to work of
 

289
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,469
meaning aikido i'm going to work of
course off the idea of her coming in to

290
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
course off the idea of her coming in to
 

291
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,870
course off the idea of her coming in to
attack me and that's what's going to set

292
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
attack me and that's what's going to set
 

293
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,350
attack me and that's what's going to set
up my takedown positions right is her

294
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
up my takedown positions right is her
 

295
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,710
up my takedown positions right is her
attacking me and trying to cover that

296
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
attacking me and trying to cover that
 

297
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,230
attacking me and trying to cover that
distance not me cutting the distance to

298
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
distance not me cutting the distance to
 

299
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,070
distance not me cutting the distance to
her but her trying to cover the distance

300
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
her but her trying to cover the distance

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,550
her but her trying to cover the distance
to me and all of those are done in a way

302
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
to me and all of those are done in a way
 

303
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,150
to me and all of those are done in a way
that i could abate those so if i if i

304
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
that i could abate those so if i if i
 

305
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,990
that i could abate those so if i if i
use that rokyo takedown that we just saw

306
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
use that rokyo takedown that we just saw
 

307
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,749

right now so she comes in and i step

308
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
right now so she comes in and i step
 

309
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,430
right now so she comes in and i step
with the rope now rokio take down now

310
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
with the rope now rokio take down now
 

311
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,350
with the rope now rokio take down now
the second her friend comes i can bail

312
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,189
the second her friend comes i can bail
out of that rokio takedown and i'm in

314

out of that rokio takedown and i'm in
 

315
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,270
out of that rokio takedown and i'm in
good position right so that also it

316
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
good position right so that also it
 

317
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,270
good position right so that also it
deals with multiple attackers so all of

318
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
deals with multiple attackers so all of
 

319
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,390
deals with multiple attackers so all of
the aikido takedowns are not the best

nagewaza and the hinko nagewaza which
 

499
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,070
nagewaza and the hinko nagewaza which
are a lot of the otoshi's

500
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
are a lot of the otoshi's
 

501
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,110
are a lot of the otoshi's

can be used to take someone down
now other than that udeoce is aikido's

504
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
now other than that udeoce is aikido's
 

505
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,990
now other than that udeoce is aikido's
prime takedown method and it's probably

506
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
prime takedown method and it's probably
 

507
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,430
prime takedown method and it's probably
the best when we're talking about our

508
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
the best when we're talking about our
 

509
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,189
the best when we're talking about our
context as far as just getting the

510
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
context as far as just getting the
 

511
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,430
context as far as just getting the
takedown now an udeoce

512
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
takedown now an udeoce
 

513
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,350
takedown now an udeoce
looks like an ekyo

514
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
looks like an ekyo
 

515
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,949
looks like an ekyo
most of the time although a ton of

516
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
most of the time although a ton of
 

517
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,190
most of the time although a ton of
things can be happening so udeo say just

518
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
things can be happening so udeo say just
 

519
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,909
things can be happening so udeo say just
means arm takedown right so this is my

520
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
means arm takedown right so this is my
 

521
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,829
means arm takedown right so this is my
udeo say position right here that's

522
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
udeo say position right here that's
 

523
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,070
udeo say position right here that's
being done with an echo if i roll her

524
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
being done with an echo if i roll her
 

525
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,829
being done with an echo if i roll her
elbow to a locked position that now

526
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
elbow to a locked position that now
 

527
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,990
elbow to a locked position that now
would be done with a rokyo if i

528
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
would be done with a rokyo if i
 

529
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,550
would be done with a rokyo if i
emphasize the gokyo in there that

530
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
emphasize the gokyo in there that
 

531
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,509
emphasize the gokyo in there that
becomes a gokyo right if i emphasize the

532
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
becomes a gokyo right if i emphasize the
 

533
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,829
becomes a gokyo right if i emphasize the
shoulder that's a kata otoshi right so

534
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
shoulder that's a kata otoshi right so
 

535
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,590
shoulder that's a kata otoshi right so
that shoulder gets smashed down into the

536
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
that shoulder gets smashed down into the
 

537
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,670
that shoulder gets smashed down into the
ground that's kata otoshi you can do

538
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
ground that's kata otoshi you can do
 

539
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,670
ground that's kata otoshi you can do
variations of kaitenage where you wrap

540
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
variations of kaitenage where you wrap
 

541
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,750
variations of kaitenage where you wrap
up and drop down like this but this is

542
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
up and drop down like this but this is
 

543
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,829
up and drop down like this but this is
all udeo se arm position this can also

544
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
all udeo se arm position this can also
 

545
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,750
all udeo se arm position this can also
be done gyaku right so our sankyo

546
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
be done gyaku right so our sankyo
 

547
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,310
be done gyaku right so our sankyo
takedown is just a gyaku udeyose so i'm

548
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
takedown is just a gyaku udeyose so i'm
 

549
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,670
takedown is just a gyaku udeyose so i'm
on the opposite side of her body but

550
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
on the opposite side of her body but
 

551
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,350
on the opposite side of her body but
it's still udeose

552
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
it's still udeose
 

553
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,269
it's still udeose
the uriose is super useful because it

554
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
the uriose is super useful because it
 

555
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,430
the uriose is super useful because it
isolates that hand and it isolates it

556
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
isolates that hand and it isolates it
 

557
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,870
isolates that hand and it isolates it
for one of two reasons they're both

558
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
for one of two reasons they're both
 

559
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,310
for one of two reasons they're both
useful for our context one is she had a

560
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
useful for our context one is she had a
 

561
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,829
useful for our context one is she had a
knife in that actually let me have you

562
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
knife in that actually let me have you
 

563
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,910
knife in that actually let me have you
switch to that hand she had a knife in

564
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
switch to that hand she had a knife in
 

565
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,710
switch to that hand she had a knife in
that hand so there's my udeo say here's

566
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
that hand so there's my udeo say here's
 

567
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,829
that hand so there's my udeo say here's
my udese here's variations on my udeose

568
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
my udese here's variations on my udeose
 

569
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,990
my udese here's variations on my udeose
right so all those things are important

570
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
right so all those things are important
 

571
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,030
right so all those things are important
because she had a weapon or if i had a

and you're going to use them a lot right
 

591
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,550
and you're going to use them a lot right
so they're highly functional for our

592
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
so they're highly functional for our
 

593
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,269

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
well it depends on the style of aikido
 

635
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,350
well it depends on the style of aikido
you study in my approach there's one

636
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
you study in my approach there's one
 

637
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,110
you study in my approach there's one
exception we have which is juji nage and

638
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
exception we have which is juji nage and
 

639
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,630
exception we have which is juji nage and
there's a special reason for that juju

640
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
there's a special reason for that juju
 

641
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,790
there's a special reason for that juju
nage exception but other than that we

642
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
nage exception but other than that we
 

643
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,069
nage exception but other than that we
don't want to mess with it so what we

644
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
don't want to mess with it so what we
 

645
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,710
don't want to mess with it so what we
want to do is get dogai she so her body

646
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
want to do is get dogai she so her body
 

647
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,310
want to do is get dogai she so her body
to turn over we want to get her body to

648
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
to turn over we want to get her body to
 

649
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,389
to turn over we want to get her body to
turn over now that's done from two basic

650
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
turn over now that's done from two basic
 

651
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,630
turn over now that's done from two basic
ideas either i can have gyakute and

652
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
ideas either i can have gyakute and
 

653
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,389
ideas either i can have gyakute and
that's because if we were standing i

654
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
that's because if we were standing i
 

655
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,150
that's because if we were standing i
would be holding her gyakute right you

656
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
would be holding her gyakute right you
 

657
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,230
would be holding her gyakute right you
can see my right hand is grabbing her

658
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
can see my right hand is grabbing her
 

659
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,150
can see my right hand is grabbing her
left hand that's yakute if we're doing

660
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
left hand that's yakute if we're doing
 

661
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,150
left hand that's yakute if we're doing
that we're going to step over this head

662
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
that we're going to step over this head
 

663
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,990
that we're going to step over this head
so we want to clear the head here and

664
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
so we want to clear the head here and
 

665
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,430
so we want to clear the head here and
then as we do that we're going to pull

666
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
then as we do that we're going to pull
 

667
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,190
then as we do that we're going to pull
her around and we're going to set her up

668
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
her around and we're going to set her up
 

669
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,790
her around and we're going to set her up
my flipped her body over and we got her

670
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
my flipped her body over and we got her
 

671
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,230
my flipped her body over and we got her
face down

672
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
face down
 

673
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,190
face down
or

674
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
or
 

675
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,350
or
i'm going to be katate dory when i do it

676
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
i'm going to be katate dory when i do it
 

677
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,110
i'm going to be katate dory when i do it
you can see now my left hand is grabbing

678
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
you can see now my left hand is grabbing
 

679
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,269
you can see now my left hand is grabbing
her left hand when we're katatte we're

680
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
her left hand when we're katatte we're
 

681
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,790
her left hand when we're katatte we're
going to do a very very similar

682
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
going to do a very very similar
 

683
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,550
going to do a very very similar
procedure except as we come around we're

684
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
procedure except as we come around we're
 

685
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,069
procedure except as we come around we're
going to be gyaku when we're done right

686
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
going to be gyaku when we're done right
 

687
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,910
going to be gyaku when we're done right
we're going to be opposite side okay now

688
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
we're going to be opposite side okay now
 

689
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,630
we're going to be opposite side okay now
the reason we do that is because we're

690
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
the reason we do that is because we're
 

691
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,870
the reason we do that is because we're
assuming she's armed right so let's say

692
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
assuming she's armed right so let's say
 

693
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,310
assuming she's armed right so let's say
that's in her belt because otherwise

694
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
that's in her belt because otherwise
 

695
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,829
that's in her belt because otherwise
that's not going to work in a second

696
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
that's not going to work in a second
 

697
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,509
that's not going to work in a second
okay now maybe there's a weapon in this

698
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
okay now maybe there's a weapon in this
 

699
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,269
okay now maybe there's a weapon in this
hand or maybe she's holding my armed

700
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
hand or maybe she's holding my armed
 

701
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,509
hand or maybe she's holding my armed
hand right and as i'm dealing with this

702
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
hand right and as i'm dealing with this
 

703
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,430
hand right and as i'm dealing with this
hand so i'm going to try to pin her what

704
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
hand so i'm going to try to pin her what
 

705
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,949
hand so i'm going to try to pin her what
she does is she goes for that knife with

706
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
she does is she goes for that knife with
 

707
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,150
she does is she goes for that knife with
the other hand now i got to deal with

708
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
the other hand now i got to deal with
 

709
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,509
the other hand now i got to deal with
this knife right so that's a real

710
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
this knife right so that's a real
 

711
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,269
this knife right so that's a real
problem for me because there's a weapon

712
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
problem for me because there's a weapon
 

713
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,829
problem for me because there's a weapon
so by assuming there's a weapon what all

714
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
so by assuming there's a weapon what all
 

715
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,670
so by assuming there's a weapon what all
the dogai she does is as she goes to get

716
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
the dogai she does is as she goes to get
 

717
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,949
the dogai she does is as she goes to get
that weapon

718
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
that weapon
 

719
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,470
that weapon
that's fine she can have that weapon and

720
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
that's fine she can have that weapon and
 

721
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,310
that's fine she can have that weapon and
she comes to try to get me that's fine

722
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
she comes to try to get me that's fine
 

723
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,590
she comes to try to get me that's fine
it's really weird way to do it i'll take

724
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
it's really weird way to do it i'll take
 

725
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,110
it's really weird way to do it i'll take
away that and there's the easy way to do

726
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
away that and there's the easy way to do
 

727
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,870
away that and there's the easy way to do
it and we get all these classic pins

728
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
it and we get all these classic pins
 

729
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,030
it and we get all these classic pins
that you would see in something like

730
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
that you would see in something like
 

731
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,790
that you would see in something like
taito to you right

732
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
taito to you right
 

733
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,590
taito to you right
so once she's on the ground we have one

734

decision to make or one thing to
 

737
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,509
decision to make or one thing to
understand is she face up or face down

understand is she face up or face down
 

739
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,509
understand is she face up or face down
if she's face up we want to get dogaishi

740
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
if she's face up we want to get dogaishi
 

741
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,590
if she's face up we want to get dogaishi
