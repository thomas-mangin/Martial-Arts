i do have to he's pushing
 

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,830
i do have to he's pushing
i do have to ground it does have to go

46
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
i do have to ground it does have to go
 

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,749
i do have to ground it does have to go
into the center

48
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
into the center
 

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,550
into the center
but my hand so my

50
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
but my hand so my
 

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,789
but my hand so my
the rebounding energies coming through

52
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
the rebounding energies coming through
 

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,949
the rebounding energies coming through
me ground going back to his center back

54
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
me ground going back to his center back
 

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,830
me ground going back to his center back
to the center but their tummy

56
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
to the center but their tummy
 

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,710
to the center but their tummy
is going to in his face okay

58
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
is going to in his face okay
 

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,030
is going to in his face okay
so if he lets go

60
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
so if he lets go
 

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,550
so if he lets go
it goes right to his face okay

62
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
it goes right to his face okay
 

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,670
it goes right to his face okay
over here

64
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
over here
 

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,150
over here
it's not just going into its face

66
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
it's not just going into its face
 

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,270
it's not just going into its face
still getting his center

68
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280

 

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,790

but this is wrong too

70
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
but this is wrong too
 

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,229
but this is wrong too
this path

72
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239

 

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,710

he is tasked in the ritual

74
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
he is tasked in the ritual
 

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,350
he is tasked in the ritual
and not letting go of his grip

76
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
and not letting go of his grip
 

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,550
and not letting go of his grip
because he's my

78
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
because he's my
 

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,830
because he's my
energy that i'm working with the energy

80
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
energy that i'm working with the energy
 

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,509
energy that i'm working with the energy
that he provides

82
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
that he provides
 

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,790
that he provides
either in his prescribed

00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
either in his prescribed
 

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,430
either in his prescribed
angle of attack but also and more

86
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
angle of attack but also and more
 

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,790
angle of attack but also and more
importantly just the energy of gravity

88
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
importantly just the energy of gravity
 

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,149
importantly just the energy of gravity
working on his mast okay

90
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
working on his mast okay
 

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,670
working on his mast okay
all that is what comes into me

92
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
all that is what comes into me
 

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,589
all that is what comes into me
into his center

94
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
into his center
 

95
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,949
into his center
but in an attempt

96
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959

 

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,229

stops his job
in any number of ways

110
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
in any number of ways
 

111
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,589
in any number of ways
you will hit him in the face

112
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
you will hit him in the face
 

113
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,390
you will hit him in the face
okay

114
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400

 

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,149

one way is

116
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
one way is
 

117
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,789
one way is
he feels it he let's go

118
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
he feels it he let's go
 

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,710
he feels it he let's go
you're gonna hit him

120
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
you're gonna hit him
 

121
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,309
you're gonna hit him
another way is

122
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
another way is
 

123
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,869
another way is
is he resists the energy well this

124
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
is he resists the energy well this
 

125
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,030
is he resists the energy well this
cannot stop oh

126
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
cannot stop oh
 

127
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,630
cannot stop oh
you're going to hit him

128
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
you're going to hit him
 

129
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,110
you're going to hit him
some ways you resist without realizing

130
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
some ways you resist without realizing
 

131
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,910
some ways you resist without realizing
it

132
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
it
 

133
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,869
it
is you try to slow noggin down

134
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
is you try to slow noggin down
 

135
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,550
is you try to slow noggin down
that's resistance

136
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560

 

137
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,190

another way is

138
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
another way is
 

139
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,910
another way is
one side of your head of your body in

140
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
one side of your head of your body in
 

141
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,470
one side of your head of your body in
this case your head

142
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
this case your head
 

143
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,949
this case your head
is being slowed down by the other side

144
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
is being slowed down by the other side
 

145
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,309
is being slowed down by the other side
of your body

146
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
of your body
 

147
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,350
of your body
it's dragging you're gonna catch up boom

148
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
it's dragging you're gonna catch up boom
 

149
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,710
it's dragging you're gonna catch up boom
you're gonna hit

150
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
you're gonna hit
 

151
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,830
you're gonna hit
okay

152
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840

 

153
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,230

if you have

154
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
if you have
 

155
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,909
if you have
your body as a unified hole

156
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
your body as a unified hole
 

157
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,270
your body as a unified hole
such that he goes right now my head went

158
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
such that he goes right now my head went
 

159
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,230
such that he goes right now my head went
do you see

160
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
do you see
 

161
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,710
do you see
but the energy is trapped in my shoulder

162
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
but the energy is trapped in my shoulder
 

163
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,550
but the energy is trapped in my shoulder
because my leg

164
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
because my leg
 

165
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,710
because my leg
is resisting my head lowering

166
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
is resisting my head lowering
 

167
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,710
is resisting my head lowering
so if i do the technique and i kick the

168
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
so if i do the technique and i kick the
 

169
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,230
so if i do the technique and i kick the
leg out

170
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240

 

171
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,590

my whole body gets smooth

172
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
my whole body gets smooth
 

173
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,830
my whole body gets smooth
this is in essence what he's doing is

174
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
this is in essence what he's doing is
 

175
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,270
this is in essence what he's doing is
noggin

176
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
noggin
 

177
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,990
noggin
so my energy goes in

178
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
so my energy goes in
 

179
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,469
so my energy goes in
and he uses his whole body

180
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
and he uses his whole body
 

181
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,990
and he uses his whole body
to make it work

182

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,430
antenna because i don't want to knock
him out but i want you to understand uh

358
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
him out but i want you to understand uh
 

359
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,150
him out but i want you to understand uh
the the energy that you're using here

360
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
the the energy that you're using here
 

361
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,949
the the energy that you're using here
okay so i'll use it on his mask

362
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
okay so i'll use it on his mask
 

363
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,550
okay so i'll use it on his mask
it's not going to cause the top to turn

364
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
it's not going to cause the top to turn
 

365
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,949
it's not going to cause the top to turn
me a bit

366
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
me a bit
 

367
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,430
me a bit
you'll be able to see

368
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
you'll be able to see
 

369
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
you'll be able to see
that

370
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
that
 

371
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,350
that
just like i'm here i'm not pushing them

372
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
just like i'm here i'm not pushing them
 

373
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,470
just like i'm here i'm not pushing them
like this

374
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
like this
 

375
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,990
like this
you see i'm using my

376
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000

 

377
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,110

ground

378
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
ground
 

379
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,750
ground
okay so let's move this arm out of the

380
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
okay so let's move this arm out of the
 

381
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,030
okay so let's move this arm out of the
way because i'm gonna touch you right

382
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
way because i'm gonna touch you right
 

383
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,750
way because i'm gonna touch you right
here our body is going here

384
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760

 

385
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,829

using the energy of his mass okay

386
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
using the energy of his mass okay
 

387
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,030
using the energy of his mass okay
the gravitational pull

388
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
the gravitational pull
 

389
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,949
the gravitational pull
is what i end up grounding the

390
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
is what i end up grounding the
 

391
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,670
is what i end up grounding the
gravitational pull of his mass

392
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
gravitational pull of his mass
 

393
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,590
gravitational pull of his mass
is what i end up grounding and

394
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
is what i end up grounding and
 

395
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,069
is what i end up grounding and
projecting out

396
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079

 

397
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,910

not out here

398
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920

 

399
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,269

feel that energy right there that's what

400
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
feel that energy right there that's what
 

401
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,350
feel that energy right there that's what
goes into

402
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
goes into
 

403
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,030
goes into
and gets him to bounce off myself okay

404
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040

 

405
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,590

so here you go let go

406
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
so here you go let go
 

407
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,509
so here you go let go
boom that is what you're hitting with

408
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
boom that is what you're hitting with
 

409
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,590
boom that is what you're hitting with
that okay try it again

410
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
that okay try it again
 

411
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,030
that okay try it again
okay so already you have some strategy

412
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
okay so already you have some strategy
 

413
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,350
okay so already you have some strategy
that you're learning so always take the

414
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
that you're learning so always take the
 

415
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,190
that you're learning so always take the
guy's battle

416
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
guy's battle
 

417
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,790
guy's battle
that's the strike always take their

418
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
that's the strike always take their
 

419
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,389
that's the strike always take their
balance

420
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
always attack the body primarily and the
 

423
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,350
always attack the body primarily and the
arm is secondary the arm is secondarily

okay

426
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
okay
 

427
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,430
okay
you don't you don't you don't try to get

somebody centered with their arm
 

431
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,710
somebody centered with their arm
that's not correct you already have

432
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
that's not correct you already have
 

433
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,110
that's not correct you already have
their center and you continue to have

their center while you're touching the
 

437
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,110
their center while you're touching the
arm is entirely different what does one

438
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
arm is entirely different what does one
 

439
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,790
arm is entirely different what does one
look like like this

440
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800

 

441
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,150

okay it's gonna do something
 

451
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,430
okay it's gonna do something
that's what it pays the arm opening

452
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
that's what it pays the arm opening
 

453
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,910
that's what it pays the arm opening
because otherwise i'd go flying
