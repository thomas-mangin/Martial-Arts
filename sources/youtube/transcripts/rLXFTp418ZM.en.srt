me
 

53
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,190
me
and i realized that the mass

54
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
and i realized that the mass
 

55
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,149
and i realized that the mass
that she was placing in her feet into

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
that she was placing in her feet into
 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,830
that she was placing in her feet into
the ground

58
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
the ground
 

59
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,950
the ground
is something that we

60
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
is something that we
 

61
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,630

we all strive for you know aikido at our
early stages

64
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759

 

65
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,510

the

66
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
the
 

67
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,190
the
that made me think

68
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
that made me think
 

69
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,950
that made me think
oh i haven't thought about how i'm

70
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
oh i haven't thought about how i'm
 

71
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,030
oh i haven't thought about how i'm
actually walking

72
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
actually walking
 

73
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,830
actually walking
and then i realized well i don't need to

74
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
and then i realized well i don't need to
 

75
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,230
and then i realized well i don't need to
think how i'm walking because i'm just

76
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
think how i'm walking because i'm just
 

77
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,789
think how i'm walking because i'm just
walking and actually enjoying the walk

78
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
walking and actually enjoying the walk
 

79
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,830
walking and actually enjoying the walk
apart from my head

80
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
apart from my head
 

81
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,469
apart from my head
down so i decided to look up

82
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
down so i decided to look up
 

83
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,389
down so i decided to look up
so that i could see the beauty

84
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399

 

85
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,950

and it's then harder to concentrate on

86
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
and it's then harder to concentrate on
 

87
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,670
and it's then harder to concentrate on
what i wanted to talk to you about

88
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680

 

89
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,670

so by being distracted easily

90
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
so by being distracted easily
 

91
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,630
so by being distracted easily
can make us so that we miss the point

92
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640

 

93
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,150

on the

94
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160

on the recent film
talking about

98
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
talking about
 

99
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,030
talking about
looking along the row

100
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
looking along the row
 

101
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,309
looking along the row
working out who you think that um

102
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319

 

103
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,229

your zanshi and your awareness

104
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239

 

105
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,990

107
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,949

it can be to your advantage

108
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
it can be to your advantage
 

109
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,150
it can be to your advantage
if you just work with those rather than

110
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
if you just work with those rather than
 

111
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,150
if you just work with those rather than
looking longer and um why can't i

112
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
looking longer and um why can't i

oh why am i
perhaps

126
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
perhaps
 

127
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,869
perhaps
we're

128
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
we're
 

129
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,030
we're
positive and negative perhaps we're two

130
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
positive and negative perhaps we're two
 

131
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,910
positive and negative perhaps we're two
positives and you know you can make it

132
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
positives and you know you can make it
 

133
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,390
positives and you know you can make it
as complicated as you want for your own

134
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
as complicated as you want for your own
 

135
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,750
as complicated as you want for your own
mind but search

136
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760

 

137
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,949

search it

138
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
search it
 

139
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,350
search it
but just like as i but my advice is just

140
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
but just like as i but my advice is just
 

141
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,670
but just like as i but my advice is just
like i was walking

142
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
like i was walking
 

143
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,509
like i was walking
and didn't have to think about my

144
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
and didn't have to think about my
 

145
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,550
and didn't have to think about my
walking heavy or light

146
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
walking heavy or light
 

147
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,190
walking heavy or light
until i heard my dog remind me

148
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
until i heard my dog remind me
 

149
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,789
until i heard my dog remind me
that she's just a natural

150
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799

 

151
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,509

living creature that

152
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
living creature that
 

153
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,309
living creature that
is

154
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
is
 

155
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,350
is
very connected with the earth

156
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
very connected with the earth
 

157
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,430
very connected with the earth
because she's not thinking like a human

158
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
because she's not thinking like a human
 

159
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,910
because she's not thinking like a human
and complicating things

161
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,350

so

162
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360

looking at them let's say they're coming
for yo community

354
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
for yo community
 

355
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,990
for yo community
you're trying to feel a sensing

356
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
you're trying to feel a sensing
 

357
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,710
you're trying to feel a sensing
somewhere within your body perhaps you

358
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
somewhere within your body perhaps you
 

359
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,870
somewhere within your body perhaps you
lift your arms momentarily afterwards

360
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
lift your arms momentarily afterwards
 

361
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,469
lift your arms momentarily afterwards
if you lift your arm when they lift

362
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
if you lift your arm when they lift
 

363
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,510
if you lift your arm when they lift
their arm that's a mechanical thing and

364
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
their arm that's a mechanical thing and
 

365
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,350
their arm that's a mechanical thing and
that's like

366
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
that's like
 

367
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,670
that's like
holding your head down and then when

368
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
holding your head down and then when
 

369
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,350
holding your head down and then when
looking up

370
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
looking up
 

371
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,749
looking up
you've lost the depth of your thought

372
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
you've lost the depth of your thought
 

373
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,070
you've lost the depth of your thought
you've transferred by lifting your arm

374
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
you've transferred by lifting your arm
 

375
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,830
you've transferred by lifting your arm
when they lift their arm you've

376
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
when they lift their arm you've
 

377
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,350
when they lift their arm you've
transferred

378
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
transferred
 

379
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,710
transferred
from sensing to mechanical

380
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
from sensing to mechanical
 

381
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,909
from sensing to mechanical
and that's

382
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
and that's
 

383
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,029
and that's
done then through body memory

384
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
done then through body memory
 

385
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,749
done then through body memory
and if you lift every time they lift

386
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
and if you lift every time they lift
 

387
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,790
and if you lift every time they lift
because your timing is good

388
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
because your timing is good
 

389
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,790
because your timing is good
and you've worked out oh i can lift

390
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
and you've worked out oh i can lift
 

391
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,710
and you've worked out oh i can lift
exactly when they lift when they lift

392
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
exactly when they lift when they lift
 

393
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,790
exactly when they lift when they lift
all it lifts my arm

394
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
all it lifts my arm
 

395
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,110
all it lifts my arm
that's your body memory

396
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
that's your body memory
 

397
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,390
that's your body memory
going through the stages of knowing

398
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
going through the stages of knowing
 

399
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,350
going through the stages of knowing
um

400
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
um
 

401
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,909
um
how to get better timing

402
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
how to get better timing
 

403
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,510
how to get better timing
and this may be a stage that you've got

404
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
and this may be a stage that you've got
 

405
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,749
and this may be a stage that you've got
to go through before you go to the stage

406
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
to go through before you go to the stage
 

407
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,830
to go through before you go to the stage
that i'm talking about

408
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
that i'm talking about
 

409
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,389
that i'm talking about
it's up to each individual to

arm will come up you don't even have to

426
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
arm will come up you don't even have to
 

427
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,670
arm will come up you don't even have to
think about where it is

428
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
think about where it is
 

429
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,590

it was as if
something somebody instructed me to do

442
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
something somebody instructed me to do
 

443
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,310
something somebody instructed me to do
that without me even knowing i was going

444

481
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,949

why do we have a whole brain if we're

482
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
why do we have a whole brain if we're
 

483
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,910
why do we have a whole brain if we're
only using a part of it

only using a part of it
 

485
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,590
only using a part of it
well perhaps we can use a little bit

486
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
well perhaps we can use a little bit
 

487
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,430
well perhaps we can use a little bit
more of our brain

you know

538
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
you know
 

539
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,150
you know
how to weigh underside your arm and how

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,710

we've got a lot to explore

we've got a lot to explore
 

553
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,350
we've got a lot to explore
and we can only do it if we're intrigued

554
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
and we can only do it if we're intrigued
 

555
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,310
and we can only do it if we're intrigued
or want to be bothered to

or want to be bothered to
 

557
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,150
or want to be bothered to
look at these different

look at these different
 

559
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,790
look at these different
formats that we can add into our own

560
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
formats that we can add into our own
 

561

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
so if my body allows me to keep going
 

565
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,389
so if my body allows me to keep going
um

566
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
um
 

567
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,590
um
in a reasonable way of flexibility

568
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600

 

569
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,870

that
well that's fine i'm still a student and

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
well that's fine i'm still a student and

and even though sensei didn't get it
 

595
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,790

right all the time nor did cytosensei so
 

597
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,910
right all the time nor did cytosensei so
that he told me

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
that he told me
 

599
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,949
that he told me
so i can't find that uniqueness

600
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
so i can't find that uniqueness
 

601
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,150
so i can't find that uniqueness
because i'm a human being and so are you

these techniques
will go from a handful

646
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
start
 

647
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,310
start
putting them in to your mix

putting them in to your mix

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,069
putting them in to your mix
of aikido

of aikido
 

651
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,750
of aikido
and you will start to become an

and you will start to become an
 

653
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,030
and you will start to become an
individual teacher and you will start to

654
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
individual teacher and you will start to
 

655
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,069
individual teacher and you will start to
perhaps shorten the techniques

656
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
perhaps shorten the techniques
 

657
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,550
perhaps shorten the techniques
making them so that

658
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
making them so that
 

659
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,269
making them so that
you've already felt the flow far before

660
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
you've already felt the flow far before
 

661

you've already felt the flow far before
the technique was started

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
the technique was started
 

663
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,269
the technique was started
therefore you can shorten it because

664
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
therefore you can shorten it because
 

665
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,910
therefore you can shorten it because

a way of pulling pegs out and raising
 

807
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,470

them

808
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
them
