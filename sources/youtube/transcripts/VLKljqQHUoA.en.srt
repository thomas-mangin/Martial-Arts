so it's a little bit like that he said
 

133
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,430
so it's a little bit like that he said
that the the attacker would use that and

00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:47,879
told us where it should be he'd shout at
 

167
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,289
told us where it should be he'd shout at
us even but then I'd see him do this

168
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:51,299
us even but then I'd see him do this
 

169
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,850
us even but then I'd see him do this
okay

170
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:52,860
okay
 

171
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,170
okay
so that's a that's a weakness as well

172
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180

 

173
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,110

when cutting

174
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,120
when cutting
 

175
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,470
when cutting
I'll do the upper half first when

176
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll do the upper half first when
 

177
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,910
I'll do the upper half first when
cutting

178
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
cutting
 

179
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,210
cutting
a lot of people their elbows go out like

180
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,220
a lot of people their elbows go out like
 

181
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,410
a lot of people their elbows go out like
this

182
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,420
this
 

183
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,809
this
and the elbows you'll notice as I come

184
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:11,819
and the elbows you'll notice as I come
 

185
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,270
and the elbows you'll notice as I come
here my elbows are much wider than my

186
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
here my elbows are much wider than my
 

187
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,150
here my elbows are much wider than my
shoulders so the idea is to try to keep

188
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,160
shoulders so the idea is to try to keep
 

189
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,710
shoulders so the idea is to try to keep
the elbows and the arms no wider than

190
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:21,720
the elbows and the arms no wider than
 

191
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,909
the elbows and the arms no wider than
the shoulders

192
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:22,919
the shoulders
 

193
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,430
the shoulders
again in the evenings when we used to

194
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
again in the evenings when we used to
 

195
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,070
again in the evenings when we used to
chat he said if you can walk through a

196
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
chat he said if you can walk through a
 

197
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,230
chat he said if you can walk through a
door while cutting

198
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
door while cutting
 

199
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,350
door while cutting
then your arms are in the right place he

200
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
then your arms are in the right place he
 

201
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,790
then your arms are in the right place he
said you'll never get through the door

202
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
said you'll never get through the door
 

203
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,610
said you'll never get through the door
like this so it's just something that

204
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:37,620
like this so it's just something that
 

205
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,430
like this so it's just something that
has stayed with me all these years

206
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:40,440
has stayed with me all these years
 

207
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,570
has stayed with me all these years
so

208
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:41,580
so
 

209
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,629
so
if you find that your elbows are going

210
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
if you find that your elbows are going
 

211
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,450
if you find that your elbows are going
out just draw them in

212
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:47,460
out just draw them in
 

213
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,310
out just draw them in
on the downward cut

214
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
on the downward cut
 

215
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,930
on the downward cut
draw them in

216
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:50,940
draw them in
 

217
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,570
draw them in
on the downed cut

218
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,580
on the downed cut
 

219
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,370
on the downed cut
if you can keep them in

220
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:58,380

 

221
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:07,129

then it's good

222
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,139

 

223
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,409

going to the back leg now

224
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
going to the back leg now
 

225
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,830
going to the back leg now
there's different variations

226
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
there's different variations
 

227
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,469
there's different variations
cytosense he said don't lock the leg but

228

239
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,409
and gone down on this bar stool
okay

you're going forwards
so project forward but don't lock it

better than I could follow the books
 

275
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,469
better than I could follow the books
so I would watch a piece of film I'd go

watching him
 

283
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,629
watching him
over those 27 years he changed

over those 27 years he changed
 

285
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,070
over those 27 years he changed
dramatically

dramatically
 

287
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,010
dramatically
and a lot of people don't like teachers

that change dramatically
but we all hopefully are going to

292
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:47,460
but we all hopefully are going to

well I'm telling you the period that I

300
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,300
well I'm telling you the period that I
 

301
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,090
well I'm telling you the period that I
saw him in what he told us and and he

302
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
saw him in what he told us and and he
 

303
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,270
saw him in what he told us and and he
was just past the age of 50 then so he

304
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,280
was just past the age of 50 then so he
 

305
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,210
was just past the age of 50 then so he
was going in between very powerful stage

306
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,220
was going in between very powerful stage
 

307
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,870
was going in between very powerful stage
and more subtle work and wanting as you

308
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
and more subtle work and wanting as you
 

309
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,090
and more subtle work and wanting as you
got older still he wanted these points

310
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,100
got older still he wanted these points
 

311
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:44,930
got older still he wanted these points
so I'm trying to give you these points

312
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940

I like to see three of each
but don't do this each time you've done

318

and if you watch sight and Scentsy on
any films check the films don't take my

word for it you see such a city on any
of the films you won't see him stepping

340
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,200
of the films you won't see him stepping
 

341
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,690
of the films you won't see him stepping
first

342
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700

the theory is Who Would You Walk

344
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
the theory is Who Would You Walk
 

345
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,570
the theory is Who Would You Walk
would you step onto a spear before you

346
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,580

in front of you
if you step first

352
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
if you step first
 

353
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,889
if you step first
it gives you stability so if you're

354
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899
it gives you stability so if you're
 

355
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,650
it gives you stability so if you're
looking for stability then please step

356
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:12,660
looking for stability then please step
 

357
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,990
looking for stability then please step
first

358
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
first
 

359
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,810
first
so the other problem that we see

360
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,820

the two fingers are the ones that do the
 

443

the two fingers are the ones that do the
squeezing and the others follow

444
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480

 

445
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,569

is this Gap too small

450
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
is this Gap too small
 

451
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,850
is this Gap too small
is this thing go out

another point is the head it will look
at times with every teacher that the

460
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
at times with every teacher that the
 

461
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,530
at times with every teacher that the
head is dead but there's down and
