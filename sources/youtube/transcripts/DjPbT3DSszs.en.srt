00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,230

right

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,240
right
 

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,990
right
but never fall down on one knee because

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
but never fall down on one knee because
 

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,150
but never fall down on one knee because
there's five other attackers

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
there's five other attackers
 

7
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,670
there's five other attackers
and when you're down there they can get

8
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
and when you're down there they can get
 

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,950
and when you're down there they can get
you

10
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
you
 

11
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,430
you
so don't well thank you

12
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
so don't well thank you
 

13
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,230
so don't well thank you
so

14
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,240
so
 

15
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,269
so
cytosensei he he said um

16
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
cytosensei he he said um
 

17
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,830
cytosensei he he said um
this is a hombu technique

18
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
this is a hombu technique
 

19
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,550
this is a hombu technique
because you can't lift your arm up when

20
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
because you can't lift your arm up when
 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,109
because you can't lift your arm up when
somebody is strong

22
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
somebody is strong
 

23
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,310
somebody is strong
so let's where's danny

24
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320

 

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,189

so

26
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
so
 

27
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,510
so
we go backwards to go forward so i put

28
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
we go backwards to go forward so i put
 

29
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,950
we go backwards to go forward so i put
my arm up here he comes he takes it down

30
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
my arm up here he comes he takes it down
 

31
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,190
my arm up here he comes he takes it down
we come around here what do i do i try

32
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
we come around here what do i do i try
 

33
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,990
we come around here what do i do i try
and

34
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
and
 

35
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,270
and
now lift my arms up

36
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
now lift my arms up
 

37
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,430
now lift my arms up
in king and agari

38
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440

 

39
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,069

i can do it

40
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
i can do it
 

41
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,150
i can do it
as long as i exchange my body for my arm

42
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
as long as i exchange my body for my arm
 

43
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,470
as long as i exchange my body for my arm
if i go here and it comes around here

44
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
if i go here and it comes around here
 

45
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,189
if i go here and it comes around here
when it's down here there's no there's

46
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
when it's down here there's no there's
 

47
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,830
when it's down here there's no there's
no way you can bring that arm higher

48
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
no way you can bring that arm higher
 

49
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,310
no way you can bring that arm higher
anymore

50
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
anymore
 

51
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,630
anymore
hence that's why i use the string method

52
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
hence that's why i use the string method
 

53
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,469
hence that's why i use the string method
because

54
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
because
 

55
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,070
because
you've got a chance you've got a small

56
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
you've got a chance you've got a small
 

57
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,109
you've got a chance you've got a small
window

58
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
window
 

59
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,350
window
here's the window

60
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360

 

61
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,789

to get the technique

62
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799

 

63
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,109

so this

64
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
so this
 

65
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,590
so this
this

66
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600

 

67
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,510

this

68
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
this
 

69
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,749
this
means that once the the point is chosen

70
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
means that once the the point is chosen
 

71
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,550
means that once the the point is chosen
it cannot alter

72
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
it cannot alter
 

73
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,310
it cannot alter
ah but i could redirect him

74
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320

 

75
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,310

what would strength

76
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320

 

77
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,069

i'll get you

78
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
i'll get you
 

79
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,030
i'll get you
i'll do it somehow

80
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040

 

81
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,429

you know so

82
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439

 

83
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,350

so if you want to do this technique

84
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360

 

85
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,429

you have to do it quick

86
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
you have to do it quick
 

87
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,630
you have to do it quick
if you go if you do this technique

88
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
if you go if you do this technique
 

89
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,870
if you go if you do this technique
forget that one i've just done they're

90
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
forget that one i've just done they're
 

91
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,270
forget that one i've just done they're
down there do

92
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
down there do
 

93
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,309
down there do
this technique

94
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319

 

95
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,630

all right so in your toolbox we've all

96
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
all right so in your toolbox we've all
 

97
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,949
all right so in your toolbox we've all
got a toolbox and as we get

98
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
got a toolbox and as we get
 

99
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,949
got a toolbox and as we get
over the years we get

100
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
over the years we get
 

101
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,270
over the years we get
a better spanner and we give the

102
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
a better spanner and we give the
 

103
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,949
a better spanner and we give the
apprentice

104
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
apprentice
 

105
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,430
apprentice
the the cheaper spanners that we bought

106
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
the the cheaper spanners that we bought
 

107
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,750
the the cheaper spanners that we bought
when we were apprentice

108
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
when we were apprentice
 

109
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,750
when we were apprentice
but we've stuck to the job

110
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
but we've stuck to the job
 

111
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,190
but we've stuck to the job
i want the

112
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
i want the
 

113
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,830
i want the
more shinier the better ones as we get

114
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
more shinier the better ones as we get
 

115
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,589
more shinier the better ones as we get
better we will start to get things that

116
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
better we will start to get things that
 

117
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,150
better we will start to get things that
perhaps bend a little to get into

118
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
perhaps bend a little to get into
 

119
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,150
perhaps bend a little to get into
special places

120
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
special places
 

121
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,670
special places
and that's really what you're doing

122
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
and that's really what you're doing
 

123
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,350
and that's really what you're doing
going through the grades

124
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
going through the grades
 

125
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,270
going through the grades
you're you're saying

126
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280

 

127
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,750

yeah but i can do this

128
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
yeah but i can do this
 

129
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,630
yeah but i can do this
so why should i improve on it i remember

130
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
so why should i improve on it i remember
 

131
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,270
so why should i improve on it i remember
teaching at um your seminar one night

132
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
teaching at um your seminar one night
 

133
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,750
teaching at um your seminar one night
and i said to this black belt

134
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
and i said to this black belt
 

135
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,589
and i said to this black belt
you can't do that

136
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
you can't do that
 

137
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,830
you can't do that
it works for me he said

138
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840

 

139
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,790

i i thought i i i

140
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
i i thought i i i
 

141
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,710
i i thought i i i
i thought i won't say no more to him

142
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
i thought i won't say no more to him
 

143
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,070
i thought i won't say no more to him
then because he's obviously got his

144
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
then because he's obviously got his
 

145
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,270
then because he's obviously got his
aikido

146
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
aikido
 

147
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,430
aikido
worked out

148
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
worked out
 

149
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,229
worked out
so why did it take 20 years for me to

150
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
so why did it take 20 years for me to
 

151
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,630
so why did it take 20 years for me to
exchange strength

152
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
exchange strength
 

153
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,270
exchange strength
to coke you you can take coke you but

154
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
to coke you you can take coke you but
 

155
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,710
to coke you you can take coke you but
really it's common sense

156
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
really it's common sense
 

157
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,710
really it's common sense
well i can't do that well what are you

158
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
well i can't do that well what are you
 

159
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,070
well i can't do that well what are you
going to do well i'm trying to do the

160
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
going to do well i'm trying to do the
 

161
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,430
going to do well i'm trying to do the
technique well

162
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
technique well
 

163
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,430
technique well
that technique's not available today you

164
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
that technique's not available today you
 

165
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,309
that technique's not available today you
know

166
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
know
 

167
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,070
know
you've got to do you've got to do

168
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
you've got to do you've got to do
 

169
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,710
you've got to do you've got to do
something else

170
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
something else
 

171
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,509
something else
so

172
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
so
 

173
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,110
so
i know i'm sort of throwing you these

174
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
i know i'm sort of throwing you these
 

175
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,630
i know i'm sort of throwing you these
different techniques but i'm trying to

176
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
different techniques but i'm trying to
