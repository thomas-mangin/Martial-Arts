and that we need to go

408
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
and that we need to go
 

409
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,269
and that we need to go
back to basics and look at what we're

so once we get

418
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
so once we get
 

419
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,110
so once we get
past the flow

420
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120

 

421
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,829

we're starting to make everything more

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
we're starting to make everything more
 

423
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,949
we're starting to make everything more

and work out the stages and then perhaps

616
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
and work out the stages and then perhaps
 

617
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,990
and work out the stages and then perhaps
we can get

618
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
we can get
 

619
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,990
we can get
closer to our senses real art

620
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
closer to our senses real art
 

621
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,079
