00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,190
once i fixed the context now i can see
aikido techniques so i thought i still

166
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
aikido techniques so i thought i still
 

167
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,830
aikido techniques so i thought i still
don't understand the context

168
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
don't understand the context
 

169
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,830
don't understand the context
other questions started to arise one of

170
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
other questions started to arise one of
 

171
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,509
other questions started to arise one of
the questions and things i was working

172
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
the questions and things i was working
 

173
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,270
the questions and things i was working
on was how do i actually get to the guy

174
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
on was how do i actually get to the guy
 

175
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,070
on was how do i actually get to the guy
with

176
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
with
 

177
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,790
with
the knife so understand that i'm seeing

178
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
the knife so understand that i'm seeing
 

179
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,869
the knife so understand that i'm seeing
aikido as an armed grappling system at

180
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
aikido as an armed grappling system at
 

181
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,190
aikido as an armed grappling system at
this point but i'm really predominantly

182
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
this point but i'm really predominantly
 

183
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,030
this point but i'm really predominantly
working from the assumption that it must

184
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
working from the assumption that it must
 

185
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,149
working from the assumption that it must
be the unarmed guy learning to deal with

186
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
be the unarmed guy learning to deal with
 

187
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,470
be the unarmed guy learning to deal with
the armed guy right so how do i get to

188
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
the armed guy right so how do i get to
 

189
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,750
the armed guy right so how do i get to
that armed guy and we started running

190
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
that armed guy and we started running
 

191
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,750
that armed guy and we started running
lots of drills if you've ever had a

192
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
lots of drills if you've ever had a
 

193
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,670
lots of drills if you've ever had a
practice like this you realize that when

194
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
practice like this you realize that when
 

195
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,670
practice like this you realize that when
someone has a weapon it's really

196
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
someone has a weapon it's really
 

197
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,910
someone has a weapon it's really
difficult to get to them without getting

198
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
difficult to get to them without getting
 

199
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,509
difficult to get to them without getting
cut severely regularly so this is a real

200
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
cut severely regularly so this is a real
 

201
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,869
cut severely regularly so this is a real
problem when you're looking at it as

202
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
problem when you're looking at it as
 

203
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,550
problem when you're looking at it as
being the unarmed guy trying to deal

204
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
being the unarmed guy trying to deal
 

205
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,630
being the unarmed guy trying to deal
with the armed guy but again going back

206
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
with the armed guy but again going back
 

207
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,509
with the armed guy but again going back
to understanding what wrist grabs do

208
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
to understanding what wrist grabs do
 

209
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,949
to understanding what wrist grabs do
this starts to

210
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
this starts to
 

211
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,630
this starts to
illustrate something to us and that's

212
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
illustrate something to us and that's
 

213
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,470
illustrate something to us and that's
that the eye kiddo person the person

214
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
that the eye kiddo person the person
 

215
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,149
that the eye kiddo person the person
doing nigel techniques they're the one

216
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
doing nigel techniques they're the one
 

217
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,149
doing nigel techniques they're the one
who's having their wrist grab so they're

218
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
who's having their wrist grab so they're
 

219
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,309
who's having their wrist grab so they're
training for the unlikely situation that

220
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
training for the unlikely situation that
 

221
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,190
training for the unlikely situation that
someone actually catches your wrist so

222
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
someone actually catches your wrist so
 

223
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,750
someone actually catches your wrist so
this really started to change things for

224
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
this really started to change things for
 

225
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,430
this really started to change things for
me and i started to realize this and

226
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
me and i started to realize this and
 

227
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,110
me and i started to realize this and
this led to some other problems that i

228
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
this led to some other problems that i
 

229
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,030
this led to some other problems that i
was having so i started trying to figure

230
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
was having so i started trying to figure
 

231
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,869
was having so i started trying to figure
out why in the world there would not be

232
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
out why in the world there would not be
 

233
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,110
out why in the world there would not be
clinches now luckily for me i began

234
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
clinches now luckily for me i began
 

235
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,710
clinches now luckily for me i began
working on another problem at exactly

236
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
working on another problem at exactly
 

237
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,190
working on another problem at exactly
the same time and that problem was

238
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
the same time and that problem was
 

239
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,949
the same time and that problem was
multiple attackers

240
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
multiple attackers
 

241
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,070
multiple attackers
i quickly quickly learned that

242
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
i quickly quickly learned that
 

243
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,630
i quickly quickly learned that
even when my students were way smaller

244
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
even when my students were way smaller
 

245
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,350
even when my students were way smaller
than me and less trained than me and not

246
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
than me and less trained than me and not
 

247
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,949
than me and less trained than me and not
as able as me

248
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
as able as me
 

249
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,509
as able as me
they still in numbers could take me down

250
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
they still in numbers could take me down
 

251
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,190
they still in numbers could take me down
right so multiples of them would still

252
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
right so multiples of them would still
 

253
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,589
right so multiples of them would still
take me down and i realized that if they

254
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
take me down and i realized that if they
 

255
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,189
take me down and i realized that if they
got a hold of me and we went into any

256
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
got a hold of me and we went into any
 

257
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,909
got a hold of me and we went into any
kind of hold held position

258
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
kind of hold held position
 

259
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,749
kind of hold held position
i might be able to force my way out

260
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
i might be able to force my way out
 

261
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,670
i might be able to force my way out
because i'm a lot stronger but

262
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
because i'm a lot stronger but
 

263
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,350
because i'm a lot stronger but
it's going to be a real fight and if

264
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
it's going to be a real fight and if
 

265
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,350
it's going to be a real fight and if
those guys were the same skill level and

266
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
those guys were the same skill level and
 

267
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,270
those guys were the same skill level and
size as me there's no way every time i

268
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
size as me there's no way every time i
 

269
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,550
size as me there's no way every time i
would lose

270
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
would lose
 

271
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,110
would lose
i put this together with the weapon

272
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
i put this together with the weapon
 

273
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,670
i put this together with the weapon
context issues and started to realize

274
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
context issues and started to realize
 

275
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,590
context issues and started to realize
that instead of being kind of what i

276
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
that instead of being kind of what i
 

277
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,270
that instead of being kind of what i
imagined it to be and this is because

278
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
imagined it to be and this is because
 

279
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,790
imagined it to be and this is because
this is what's in movies and stuff right

280
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
this is what's in movies and stuff right
 

281
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,710
this is what's in movies and stuff right
in movies the good guy throws his knife

282
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
in movies the good guy throws his knife
 

283
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,189
in movies the good guy throws his knife
away and then he you know does some some

284
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
away and then he you know does some some
 

285
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,110
away and then he you know does some some
special martial arts moves to win the

286
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
special martial arts moves to win the
 

287
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,990
special martial arts moves to win the
day

288
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
day
 

289
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,469
day
i realized that that was the kind of

290
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
i realized that that was the kind of
 

291
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,150
i realized that that was the kind of
context i was trying to force so when i

292
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
context i was trying to force so when i
 

293
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
context i was trying to force so when i
understood aikido as a weapon system i

294
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
understood aikido as a weapon system i
 

295
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,070
understood aikido as a weapon system i
understood it as oh i must be unarmed

296
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
understood it as oh i must be unarmed
 

297
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,950
understood it as oh i must be unarmed
and i'm trying to deal with an armed guy

298
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
and i'm trying to deal with an armed guy
 

299
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,909
and i'm trying to deal with an armed guy
that led to clinches and it led to a

300
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
that led to clinches and it led to a
 

301
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,710
that led to clinches and it led to a
reasonable amount of success but once i

302
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
reasonable amount of success but once i
 

303
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,629
reasonable amount of success but once i
started to realize that actually it was

304
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
started to realize that actually it was
 

305
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,270
started to realize that actually it was
the other way around and that the aikido

306
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
the other way around and that the aikido
 

307
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,909
the other way around and that the aikido
person should be the armed person that

308
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
person should be the armed person that
 

309
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,990
person should be the armed person that
changed things so if you're in a

310
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
changed things so if you're in a
 

311
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,310
changed things so if you're in a
situation where bigger stronger people

312
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
situation where bigger stronger people
 

313
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,469
situation where bigger stronger people
are trying to hurt you you're going to

314
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
are trying to hurt you you're going to
 

315
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,870
are trying to hurt you you're going to
use a weapon and that was the context

316
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
use a weapon and that was the context
 

317
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,950
use a weapon and that was the context
that ikeda was talking about the only

318
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
that ikeda was talking about the only
 

319
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,150
that ikeda was talking about the only
way you're going to be able to handle

320
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
way you're going to be able to handle
 

321
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,070
way you're going to be able to handle
multiple attackers is if you have a

322
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
multiple attackers is if you have a
 

323
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,909
multiple attackers is if you have a
weapon that can do so much serious

324
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
weapon that can do so much serious
 

325
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,909
weapon that can do so much serious
damage that it will hurt and stop the

326
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919

basically a fight club where we smashed
each other against the wall once i got

428
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
each other against the wall once i got

but it involved you having the weapon
because you would need a weapon if

because you would need a weapon if
 

445
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,110
because you would need a weapon if

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
in multiple attacker situations or a
 

489
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,189
in multiple attacker situations or a
situation where a guy was bigger and

490
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
situation where a guy was bigger and
 

491
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,629
situation where a guy was bigger and
better than you and aikido needed to

492
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
better than you and aikido needed to
 

493
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,550
better than you and aikido needed to
answer those kinds of questions so i

494
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
answer those kinds of questions so i
 

495
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,790
answer those kinds of questions so i
moved that to this kind of mobile weapon

496
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
moved that to this kind of mobile weapon
 

497
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,230
moved that to this kind of mobile weapon
platform which is what i started to

498
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
platform which is what i started to
 

499
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,309
platform which is what i started to
think aikido was where

500
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
think aikido was where
 

501
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,110
think aikido was where
using the weapon was the agenda and

502
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
using the weapon was the agenda and
 

503
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,790
using the weapon was the agenda and
aikido was just a system to help you

504
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
aikido was just a system to help you
 

505
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,790
aikido was just a system to help you
stay autonomous so you could stay free

506
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
stay autonomous so you could stay free
 

507
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,309
stay autonomous so you could stay free
and move around and use your weapon

508
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
and move around and use your weapon
 

509
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,350
and move around and use your weapon
right now if you think about that in a

510
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
right now if you think about that in a
 

511
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,510
right now if you think about that in a
modern context to me that seemed really

512
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
modern context to me that seemed really
 

513
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,710
modern context to me that seemed really
really useful because like if i had a

514
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
really useful because like if i had a
 

515
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,790
really useful because like if i had a
pistol and i'm moving around and people

516
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
pistol and i'm moving around and people
 

517
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,230
pistol and i'm moving around and people
are trying to attack me i could use the

518
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
are trying to attack me i could use the
 

519
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,990
are trying to attack me i could use the
pistol while i'm moving around to stay

520
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
pistol while i'm moving around to stay
 

521
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,750
pistol while i'm moving around to stay
free and the same would be true for the

522
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
free and the same would be true for the
 

523
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,110
free and the same would be true for the
samurai back in the day with their

524
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
samurai back in the day with their
 

525
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,870
samurai back in the day with their
swords knives naginatas whatever weapons

526
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
swords knives naginatas whatever weapons
 

527
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,630
swords knives naginatas whatever weapons
they have and so this is probably the

528
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
they have and so this is probably the
 

529
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,550
they have and so this is probably the
kind of mindset you ishiba had if we're

530
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
kind of mindset you ishiba had if we're
 

531
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,150
kind of mindset you ishiba had if we're
going to deal with multiple attackers we

532
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
going to deal with multiple attackers we
 

533
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,070
going to deal with multiple attackers we
have to have a weapon so i was looking

534
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
have to have a weapon so i was looking
 

535
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,750
have to have a weapon so i was looking

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
at aikido as a mobile weapon platform
