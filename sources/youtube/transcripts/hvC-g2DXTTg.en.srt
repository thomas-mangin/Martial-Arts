00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,230

the techniques always look very simple

00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,240
the techniques always look very simple
 

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,309
the techniques always look very simple
so look if i go like this this is outer

4
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
so look if i go like this this is outer
 

5
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,349
so look if i go like this this is outer
deltoid

6
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
deltoid
 

7
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,829
deltoid
this is the outer deltoid right now okay

8
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
this is the outer deltoid right now okay
 

9
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,430
this is the outer deltoid right now okay
and strong again we just keep

10
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
and strong again we just keep
 

11
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,790
and strong again we just keep
it's going to just keep pushing that

12
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
it's going to just keep pushing that
 

13
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,709
it's going to just keep pushing that
thing

14
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719

 

15
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,390

and you can't go again either you go yen

16
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400

 

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,550

so you have to be able to figure this

18
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
so you have to be able to figure this
 

19
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,990
so you have to be able to figure this
out

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
out
 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,230
out
so we're going to go forward this time

22
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
so we're going to go forward this time
 

23
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,990
so we're going to go forward this time
because you're getting away with

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,709

let me just go forward okay

30
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
let me just go forward okay
 

31
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,030
let me just go forward okay
when i go forward i have to get my

32
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
when i go forward i have to get my
 

33
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,709
when i go forward i have to get my
finger even when i go backwards this

34
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
