see that way there's a yin opening for
the edema
if he's still coming this way until i
injure
let me do it if i could okay if i have
if that's when he finally goes that way
that's a yong yong clash
he's too big for me i can't do it i
can't do it okay
and you won't be able to do it for real
either okay so
the reconciliation is here
he's light over here i can move easily
into the free space okay
that's not what's taking him in the down
hole he goes walmart is done there's a
free space here
i'm just staying up with his elbow i
didn't push his elbow
i'm just staying up in his elbow
up he's already falling that way and i
feel that space and i stay up with his
elbow
boom
