in Chico the grounding vector cuts

14
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
in Chico the grounding vector cuts
 

15
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,650
in Chico the grounding vector cuts
through your feet not through your

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:35,660
through your feet not through your
 

17
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,820
through your feet not through your
kneecaps okay so when you ground through

18
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:39,830
kneecaps okay so when you ground through
 

19
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,840
kneecaps okay so when you ground through
your knees there's really no stabilizing

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,850
your knees there's really no stabilizing
 

21
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,630
your knees there's really no stabilizing
energy there because the kneecap can

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
energy there because the kneecap can

move do you understand that then the

24
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,610
move do you understand that then the
 

25
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,760
move do you understand that then the
kneecap move your kneecap and you're

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:51,770
kneecap move your kneecap and you're
 

27
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,000
kneecap move your kneecap and you're
gonna see oh yeah it's meant to float

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,010
gonna see oh yeah it's meant to float
 

29
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,229
gonna see oh yeah it's meant to float
like that do you see that so when you go

30
00:03:59,229 --> 00:03:59,239
like that do you see that so when you go
 

31
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,080
like that do you see that so when you go
to brace for example on this second move

and you're starting to diminish the
 

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,780
and you're starting to diminish the
cartilage between the kneecap and the

42

cartilage between the kneecap and the
 

43
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,650

do you understand the grounding vector

52
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,350
do you understand the grounding vector
 

53
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,760
do you understand the grounding vector
is not at my kneecap nor between my feet

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:35,770
is not at my kneecap nor between my feet
 

55
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,220
is not at my kneecap nor between my feet
of my kneecap somewhere here

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,230
of my kneecap somewhere here
 

57
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,850
of my kneecap somewhere here
do you understand so when he's when he's

58
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:41,860
do you understand so when he's when he's
 

59
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,460
do you understand so when he's when he's
pushing it's not that cheese

60
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,470
pushing it's not that cheese
 

61
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,430

I'm drowning on my knees I'm grounding

62
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm drowning on my knees I'm grounding
 

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,410
I'm drowning on my knees I'm grounding
on my feet you see so he's pushing it's

64
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:55,420
on my feet you see so he's pushing it's
 

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,870
on my feet you see so he's pushing it's
my feet which is why I don't need my

66
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:57,880
my feet which is why I don't need my
 

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,010
my feet which is why I don't need my
kneecaps push you see he's not knocking

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,020
kneecaps push you see he's not knocking
 

69
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,540
kneecaps push you see he's not knocking
me down do you understand

70
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:05,550
me down do you understand
 

71
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,690
me down do you understand
so he's pushy and I can you push really

72
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:09,700
so he's pushy and I can you push really
 

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,170
so he's pushy and I can you push really
hard

74
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,180
hard
 

75
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,380

he's just grounded you can stand up just

76
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,390
he's just grounded you can stand up just
 

77
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,400
he's just grounded you can stand up just
ground me grounding on my feet just like

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,410
ground me grounding on my feet just like
 

79
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,470
ground me grounding on my feet just like
here do you understand

80
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,480
here do you understand
 

81
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:28,350
here do you understand
okay so don't get greedy you're here

82
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,360
okay so don't get greedy you're here
 

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,249

and then you're going to push on that

84
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:32,259
and then you're going to push on that
 

85
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,290
and then you're going to push on that
knee it's on your feet you'll feet do it

86
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300
knee it's on your feet you'll feet do it
 

87
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,640
knee it's on your feet you'll feet do it
oh here do you understand not this knee

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:41,650
oh here do you understand not this knee
 

89
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,189
oh here do you understand not this knee
cap okay

90
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199

 

91
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,309

so throughout your technique you don't

92
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
so throughout your technique you don't
 

93
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,070
so throughout your technique you don't
want your kneecap to float across your

94
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
want your kneecap to float across your
 

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,670
want your kneecap to float across your
femur so I don't do it when I'm bracing

96
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
femur so I don't do it when I'm bracing
 

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,490
femur so I don't do it when I'm bracing
and I don't do it when I she go

98
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:02,500
and I don't do it when I she go
 

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,040
and I don't do it when I she go
so when you cheat go somebody go like

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,050
so when you cheat go somebody go like
 

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:15,899
so when you cheat go somebody go like
this you see that okay so I can spin on

102
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:15,909
this you see that okay so I can spin on
 

103
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,459
this you see that okay so I can spin on
my the can't move it laterally across

104
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:20,469
my the can't move it laterally across
 

105
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:24,029
my the can't move it laterally across
the mount because it will move laterally

106
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:24,039
the mount because it will move laterally
 

107
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,969
the mount because it will move laterally
across my femur so the first move this

108
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:29,979
across my femur so the first move this
 

109
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,680
across my femur so the first move this
is the tendency you go like this you see

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:34,690
is the tendency you go like this you see
 

111
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,580
is the tendency you go like this you see
that like you just rolled your kneecap

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,590
that like you just rolled your kneecap
 

113
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,769
that like you just rolled your kneecap
the first move just here you see no

114
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:43,779
the first move just here you see no
 

115
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:53,939
the first move just here you see no
rolling I'm here I turn this face onto

116
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:53,949
rolling I'm here I turn this face onto
 

117
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:54,839

my feet

118
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:54,849

119
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,460

you see

120
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,470

 

121
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,150

oh okay now what you get it back on my

122
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
oh okay now what you get it back on my
 

123
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,360
oh okay now what you get it back on my
feet because this has a follow-up I have

124
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,370
feet because this has a follow-up I have
 

125
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,430

to just now a moment the angle you see
 

127
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,460
to just now a moment the angle you see
now when I come in I can only rotate on

128
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,470
now when I come in I can only rotate on
 

129
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,120
now when I come in I can only rotate on

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,470
the second one what do you think I'm
going to do here

136
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:29,480
going to do here
 

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,890
going to do here
rotate on to me do you see rotate on

138
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:33,900
rotate on to me do you see rotate on
 

139
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,900
rotate on to me do you see rotate on
with you but this is what we have in

140
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,910
with you but this is what we have in

150
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,040

 

151
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,330

why do I have to slide this because I'm

see okay the I should feel the
resistance of the mat and it's going to

526
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:16,149
resistance of the mat and it's going to
 

527
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,500
resistance of the mat and it's going to
tell me how much I need to pick it up

528
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,510
tell me how much I need to pick it up

much it's up don't know just pick it up
 

551
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,279
much it's up don't know just pick it up
enough that it's not sliding the kneecap

552
00:25:59,279 --> 00:25:59,289
enough that it's not sliding the kneecap
 

553
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,919
enough that it's not sliding the kneecap
so when I when I in turn I'm here boom

554
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:03,929
so when I when I in turn I'm here boom
 

555
