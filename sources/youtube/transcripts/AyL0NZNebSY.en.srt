what working to do now if we have

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:21,930
what working to do now if we have
 

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,349
what working to do now if we have
perfect Aikido and the perfect ability

14
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:25,859
then they could never break that
 

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,140
then they could never break that
distance and they could never touch us

16
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,150
distance and they could never touch us
 

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,779
distance and they could never touch us
right and this is like the the fame

18
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:28,789
right and this is like the the fame
 

19
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,980
right and this is like the the fame
19:25 about that you wish you had

against the swordsman where the

22
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:32,460
against the swordsman where the
 

23
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,860
against the swordsman where the
swordsmen got so frustrated he threw

24
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:33,870
swordsmen got so frustrated he threw
 

25
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,479
swordsmen got so frustrated he threw
down his sword because he just never

26
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:35,489
down his sword because he just never
 

27
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,490
down his sword because he just never
could land a clean strike on you but

28
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
could land a clean strike on you but
 

29
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,869
could land a clean strike on you but
right so he was able to keep that

30
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
right so he was able to keep that
 

31
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,450
right so he was able to keep that
distance so cleanly that the guy could

32
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:41,460
distance so cleanly that the guy could
 

33
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,970
distance so cleanly that the guy could
never break it down however if you don't

34
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:43,980
never break it down however if you don't
 

35
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,709
never break it down however if you don't
have perfect IQ which I certainly don't

36
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
have perfect IQ which I certainly don't
 

37
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,660
have perfect IQ which I certainly don't
then sometimes that distance is going to

38
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:47,670
then sometimes that distance is going to
 

39
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,549
then sometimes that distance is going to
break down and if that distance breaks

40
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,559
break down and if that distance breaks
 

41
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,900
break down and if that distance breaks
down you're gonna be looking for

42
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:50,910
down you're gonna be looking for
 

43
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,540
down you're gonna be looking for
suppression and burying a line changing

44
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:53,550
suppression and burying a line changing
 

45
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,979
suppression and burying a line changing
the line that you're on and that was the

46
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:54,989
the line that you're on and that was the
 

47
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,240
the line that you're on and that was the
last video where we talked about the

48
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,250
last video where we talked about the
 

49
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,279
last video where we talked about the
basic idea of that so now let's look at

50
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,289
basic idea of that so now let's look at
 

51
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,590
basic idea of that so now let's look at
how we're gonna vary that line in Aikido

52
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
how we're gonna vary that line in Aikido
 

53
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,389
how we're gonna vary that line in Aikido
we have six movements that are called

54
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
we have six movements that are called
 

55
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,369
we have six movements that are called
the Tai no pinko the variation in

56
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:04,379
the Tai no pinko the variation in
 

57
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,380
the Tai no pinko the variation in
positions and those variation positions

58
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,390
positions and those variation positions
 

59
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,179
positions and those variation positions
give us an advantage over the other

60
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:08,189
give us an advantage over the other
 

61
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,100
give us an advantage over the other
person so when they're attacking and

62
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,110
person so when they're attacking and
 

63
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,380
person so when they're attacking and
they've crushed that line these six give

64
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,390
they've crushed that line these six give
 

65
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,270
they've crushed that line these six give
us an advantage so jongshin's economy

66
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,280
us an advantage so jongshin's economy
 

67
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,429
us an advantage so jongshin's economy
for me right here like this there are

68
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
for me right here like this there are
 

69
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,910
for me right here like this there are
six basic ways to move 45 so I'm going

70
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
six basic ways to move 45 so I'm going
 

71
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,710
six basic ways to move 45 so I'm going
to keep the same lead foot and move it a

72
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:21,720
to keep the same lead foot and move it a
 

73
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,219
to keep the same lead foot and move it a
45 degree angle triangle I'm gonna go to

74
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:25,229
45 degree angle triangle I'm gonna go to
 

75
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,499
45 degree angle triangle I'm gonna go to
a 45 degree angle and switch my lead

76
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:27,509
a 45 degree angle and switch my lead
 

77
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,359
a 45 degree angle and switch my lead

want to stand at 90 like this because

86
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
want to stand at 90 like this because

they're also basically the ideas we do

136
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,410
they're also basically the ideas we do
 

137
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,560
they're also basically the ideas we do
when we're at a distance so whether I'm

138
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,570
when we're at a distance so whether I'm
 

139
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,120
when we're at a distance so whether I'm
circling around to the outside or

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,130
circling around to the outside or
 

141
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,250

is I'm trying to do that's basically the

144
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,210
is I'm trying to do that's basically the
 

145
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,360
is I'm trying to do that's basically the
same ideas we're gonna work with now if

146
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,370
same ideas we're gonna work with now if
 

147
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,270
