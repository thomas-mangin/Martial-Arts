00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,169

uh anyone who's got my book it will say

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:03,179
uh anyone who's got my book it will say

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,210
uh anyone who's got my book it will say
don't go backwards to go forwards but

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:05,220
don't go backwards to go forwards but
 

5
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,369
don't go backwards to go forwards but
some people don't understand that

6
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:07,379
some people don't understand that
 

7
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,770
some people don't understand that
if I go here

8
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:09,780
if I go here
 

9
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,390
if I go here
get it out

10
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,400
get it out
 

11
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,789
get it out
and do it then it's okay but I've

12
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
and do it then it's okay but I've
 

13
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,430
and do it then it's okay but I've
actually use that with strength

14
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
actually use that with strength
 

15
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,590
actually use that with strength
there's another one that Nick was

16
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:18,600
there's another one that Nick was
 

17
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,710
there's another one that Nick was
showing if I if I do go up

18
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
showing if I if I do go up
 

19
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,929
showing if I if I do go up
and take it then it's basic because I've

20
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:23,939
and take it then it's basic because I've
 

21
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,849
and take it then it's basic because I've
got one hand on it but what am I going

22
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:25,859
got one hand on it but what am I going
 

23
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,429
got one hand on it but what am I going
to do now

24
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:28,439

 

25
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,370

it just it just come from that height

26
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,380
it just it just come from that height
 

27
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,889
it just it just come from that height
it went that high now it's back to this

28
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:33,899
it went that high now it's back to this
 

29
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,650
it went that high now it's back to this
height where's it going to go again

30
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,660
height where's it going to go again
 

31
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,690
height where's it going to go again
you know

32
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:38,700
you know
 

33
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,910
you know
look I know you're a prized fight when

34
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
look I know you're a prized fight when
 

35
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,990
look I know you're a prized fight when
you're in the street and you've had too

36
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
you're in the street and you've had too
 

37
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,430
you're in the street and you've had too
many drinks but can you give me half an

38
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
many drinks but can you give me half an
 

39
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,709
many drinks but can you give me half an
hour because I need this technique

40
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:45,719
hour because I need this technique
 

41
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,930
hour because I need this technique
you ain't you haven't got I've been in

42
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:47,940
you ain't you haven't got I've been in
 

43
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,510
you ain't you haven't got I've been in
real situations and you don't it's

44
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
real situations and you don't it's
 

45
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,010
real situations and you don't it's
milliseconds you've got milliseconds

46
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,020

 

47
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,529

that's that technique you was doing

48
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:00,539
that's that technique you was doing
 

49
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,650
that's that technique you was doing
I can't lift it up lower it down I can't

50
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:03,660
I can't lift it up lower it down I can't
 

51
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,410
I can't lift it up lower it down I can't
do anything more so where does it come

52
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:06,420
do anything more so where does it come
 

53
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,969
do anything more so where does it come
from

54
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:07,979
from
 

55
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,850
from
foreign

56
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:09,860
foreign
 

57
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,230
foreign
so you can see

58
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
so you can see
 

59
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,770
so you can see
this hand

60
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:18,780

 

61
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,289

so now we've got two techniques that

62
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:21,299
so now we've got two techniques that
 

63
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,950
so now we've got two techniques that
look exactly the same

64
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960

 

65
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,310

I don't know what foot he's got forward

66
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,320
I don't know what foot he's got forward
 

67
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,609
I don't know what foot he's got forward
so I could be like this but it would

68
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:31,619
so I could be like this but it would
 

69
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,310
so I could be like this but it would
help if I'm in hand me but I could be

70
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
help if I'm in hand me but I could be
 

71
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,469
help if I'm in hand me but I could be
like this because I don't know what foot

72
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
like this because I don't know what foot
 

73
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,690
like this because I don't know what foot
he's got forward I have to choose what

74
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:38,700
he's got forward I have to choose what
 

75
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,429
he's got forward I have to choose what
way I'm going to go

76
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
way I'm going to go
 

77
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,249
way I'm going to go
so I'm going to go this way or this way

78
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:43,259
so I'm going to go this way or this way
 

79
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,010
so I'm going to go this way or this way
this way or this way how am I going to

80
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,020
this way or this way how am I going to
 

81
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,190
this way or this way how am I going to
lift my arms up I can't lift them up so

82
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
lift my arms up I can't lift them up so
 

83
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,950
lift my arms up I can't lift them up so
I leave them where they are

84
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
I leave them where they are
 

85
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,030
I leave them where they are
I take it out I leave him where he is

86
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,040
I take it out I leave him where he is
 

87
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,410
I take it out I leave him where he is
I step out here we're back to almost now

88
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,420
I step out here we're back to almost now
 

89
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,969
I step out here we're back to almost now
katatadori if you think about it and

90
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:01,979
katatadori if you think about it and
 

91
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,130
katatadori if you think about it and
then I'll push him down

92
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
then I'll push him down
 

93
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,670
then I'll push him down
so I've now got two techniques that I

94
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
so I've now got two techniques that I
 

95
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,710
so I've now got two techniques that I
don't have to worry about oh how many

96
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
don't have to worry about oh how many
 

97
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,750
don't have to worry about oh how many
techniques we've got to remember because

98
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
techniques we've got to remember because
 

99
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,550
techniques we've got to remember because
I'm starting to piece them together

100
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm starting to piece them together
 

101
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,050
I'm starting to piece them together
slowly

102
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,060
slowly
 

103
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,809
slowly
if I if I

104
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:17,819
if I if I
 

105
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,729
if I if I
do this

106

do this
 

107
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,470
do this
and that

108
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,480
and that
 

109
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,809
and that

I can't bring it I can't bring it up but

112
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
I can't bring it I can't bring it up but
 

113
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,770
I can't bring it I can't bring it up but
I can leave it there and I can move my

114
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,780
I can leave it there and I can move my
 

115
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:40,070
I can leave it there and I can move my
buttock to my hand my buttock to my hand

116

117
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,390

okay and then you know the rest

118
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400

 

119
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,530

okay

120
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,540
okay
 

121
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,440
okay
