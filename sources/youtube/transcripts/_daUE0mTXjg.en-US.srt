1
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,000
It's 9 a.m. and we are about to board on the plane for Shikoku.

2
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:42,167
We are in Tokyo Haneda domestic airport.

3
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:47,800
We are attending the bi-yearly seminar of Chiba Sensei in Wakimachi

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,200
The group from Tokyo usually consists of 5 to 10 people

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,867
We are going there to train non-stop for 2 days,

6
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,367
then heading straight back to the plane and back to work.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,033
Based on what he will show during these two days, we have months worth of study material.

8
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,200
We are going to board in 5 minutes so see you later!

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,067
The flight will take about an hour.

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,667
Here we are in Tokushima, the main city on Shikoku island.

11
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:08,533
We are still at the airport, waiting for our rental car to go to Wakimachi.

12
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:15,233
But before we go, I wanted to show you these statues of Awa-odori dancers.

13
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,933
It's a traditional Japanese dance and Tokushima is where it came from.

14
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:28,567
There is a very big festival here every August with hundreds of traditional dancers like these.

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,067
So maybe we'll come back later and make a little video about that.

16
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:32,700
I was born in 1931.

17
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,967
I'm 82.

18
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,367
Sensei, where were you born?

19
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,933
Here.

20
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,567
How did I start [Budo]?

21
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,400
Well...

22
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,567
because it was fun!

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,867
It was when World Ward II started.

24
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:50,900
The schools had been turned into cultural centers

25
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,500
and some were teaching Budo.

26
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700
Just next door, there was a dojo.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,633
They were doing Judo and Kendo.

28
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:09,300
But Kendo, with the sword, the armor, and all that, it was kind of a pain.

29
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,833
So I prefered to do Judo.

30
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,233
For the New Year,

31
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,367
we had the hatsu-geiko [first training of the year].

32
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,900
These were a rare occasion to eat nice things

33
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,567
because we usually didn't have much.

34
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:29,767
We deserved it because the Judo falls were really painful.

35
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:35,900
We used to throw each other like that!

36
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,633
That is how I started.

37
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:41,533
I was in elementary school [at age 7 or 8].

38
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,633
We used to wear the armor, and use the shinai,

39
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,067
you know, the Kendo gear.

40
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,700
We just put on the gear like that,

41
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,333
we did not have tenugi [towels] at the school.

42
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,000
We just put the helmet on bare head and whenever we got hit,

43
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,800
it hurt like hell!

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,867
It was the same for the shinai.

45
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,300
Inside,

46
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,700
we put rolled newspaper between the bamboo blades,

47
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:12,767
and tied them very tightly.

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,500
When we got hit on the head or the forearms,

49
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,767
it hurt a lot.

50
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,560
That is how we used to practice.

51
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,060
After that I returned to Judo.

52
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,700
But my Sensei told me:

53
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,267
"Judo is great but"

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,300
"before, we used to have atemi"

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,933
"but if you don't give atemi, your partner won't fall"

56
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,633
So we started using atemi.

57
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,500
Like that!

58
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,233
And from there,

59
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,600
he told me to enroll in another school,

60
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,400
and it was Daito-ryu.

61
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,200
But soon after I got a letter from the army.

62
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,167
It said:

63
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,633
"Apt for armed service."

64
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,400
It was written:

65
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,900
"Assault troops schools."

66
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,800
That is what it said.

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,467
I got it three months before the end of the war.

68
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,600
It was an appeal for volunteers.

69
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
To enroll, you had to undergo a physical examination,

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,267
but when I got there,

71
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:55,433
the Emperor had declared the surrender of Japan.

72
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:02,600
That is what must have happened but I did not know anything at the time.

73
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,467
These were strange times.

74
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,233
I heard from someone that the war was over.

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,367
I thought: "That's it, we lost"

76
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,800
Then you came back here?

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,467
There was no point being a volunteer anymore.

78
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:41,700
And from then on, we had nothing.

79
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,033
Money was worth nothing.

80
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:51,400
Standing face to face,

81
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,833
this technique is from ippondori but it is also found in 5-kajo,

82
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,867
because there are many different ways to do this.

83
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:06,433
So we take a guard like this right?

84
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,267
Like this...

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is the way we do it in Daito-ryu.

86
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,033
Doing it directly is quite unusual.

87
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,400
But in kamae...

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,100
you raise like this, from there...

89
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,633
but not like that!

90
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,067
If you open your elbow, your opponent can enter.

91
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,733
Like this, shaving motion,

92
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,167
so you can enter,

93
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:47,767
and from that point, take uke's center.

94
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:53,533
From there, cut.

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,233
This is suburi [cut].

96
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,567
That is how we do it.

97
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:07,000
From then on, I started Daito-ryu.

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I heard about a place where they practiced Daito-ryu,

99
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,933
so I went to visit it.

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,000
I was told it was the office of someone named Nakatsu [Heizaburo].

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,333
He was a 6th Dan [Kodokan] Judo

102
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,467
He was one of the 6 experts who went to protect the Asahi newspaper.

103
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,100
The team had been put together by Ishii Mitsujiro

104
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,833
because the newspaper had been attacked three times [by right wing terrorists].

105
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:44,167
Takuma Hisa Sensei was the head of security there.

106
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:49,300
It is also the time when Ueshiba Morihei was asked [by Ishii] to come to the journal

107
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:56,800
because he knew violent koryu techniques.

108
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,133
It lasted 5 years

109
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,767
and from the 6th, it was called Asahi-ryu.

110
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:09,133
So the techniques that are in the Takumakai's Soden

111
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:17,233
corresponding to these first 5 years are those taught by Ueshiba.

112
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,767
The picture collection.

113
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,433
From that point,

114
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,967
Takeda Sokaku arrived.

115
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:40,333
And Ueshiba returnerd to Tokyo...

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Ueshiba took his students with him.

117
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:56,267
From then on, Takeda Sokaku took over the teaching at the journal.

118
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:00,533
The rest of the Soden pictures represent that.

119
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,600
This was before Chiba Sensei's time.

120
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,633
Before they met [Nakatsu and Chiba]

121
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,067
So this is the start of the period with Takeda Sokaku

122
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,267
and the master-disciple transmission with Nakatsu Sensei.

123
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:24,533
It was a long time ago but they had cameras

124
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,300
that they used at the journal.

125
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,933
Imagine that, click! click!

126
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,300
This is how they took all these pictures,

127
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:43,433
there must have been thousands of them.

128
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,833
All of very high quality for the time.

129
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,300
It is because they were at a newspaper that they could do it,

130
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,367
but even there, people complained.

131
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:58,133
There were gossips

132
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:09,133
because they were using large amounts of film.

133
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,700
They took pictures during the breaks.

134
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:32,667
Click! Click! Click!

135
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:39,533
They did it by pretexting that since the practice had been intense,

136
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:46,100
Sensei had to go for a bath.

137
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,733
And they took these pictures in the meantime behind his back.

138
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:58,100
But I think he probably wasn't fooled by it.

139
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,467
They were taking pictures of techniques that they were doing for the first time

140
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:10,833
so these were not much use as learning tools, but just reminders of the new forms.

141
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:17,200
You cannot understand these picturs alone.

142
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:25,867
This means that atemi is essential.

143
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:31,700
You use it to make your opponent move.

144
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:39,600
Not like this! You have to get through!

145
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:46,700
It all happens on the elbow joint.

146
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:56,433
Go this way,

147
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:07,633
and that is how you end up there.

148
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:22,433
And then, another atemi on the head!

149
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,867
And you exit like this.

150
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:42,433
Then Nakatsu Sensei retired from the Asahi journal.

151
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:47,767
Since he was from Ikeda, he came back here.

152
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,133
He setup a small dojo in his chiropractic cabinet.

153
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:09,600
It was in the waiting room, a very small place.

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
It was about 4 square meters.

155
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:26,033
On the other side, there was the treatment room.

156
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:38,567
It was for those with dislocated jaws,

157
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:44,267
or hurt joints and broken bones.

158
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:55,433
In the waiting room of his cabinet,

159
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:59,433
there were no X-rays at the time,

160
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:05,967
so you had to touch to make a diagnostic, based form experience.

161
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,933
We had to make do with what little we had.

162
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:16,867
We diagnosed like that and tried to put things back together.

163
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:22,867
We used to secure the hips of the patient

164
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:26,500
to prevent messing him up.

165
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,833
It was like that at the time.

166
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:37,833
Did Nakatsu Sensei do any advertizing to get students?

167
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:43,500
Not at all, he would never have done that!

168
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:49,467
For him, anybody was suitable.

169
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,267
"Go ahead"

170
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:52,733
It was always "Go ahead" with him.

171
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:56,700
He liked to drink with someone,

172
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,900
but there was not a lot [of alcohol] at the time,

173
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,300
that a the way to make him happy.

174
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,233
Black market sake right?

175
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:14,600
So I brought some to him, telling him to use as he pleased,

176
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,233
and he said "Thank you".

177
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,667
That is how I started.

178
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,567
I knew how to do shikko [moving on one's knees]

179
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:31,033
and he used to say "One has to start with shikko"

180
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,867
I had done Judo, Kendo, and a lot of other things...

181
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:41,500
Your body was well conditioned.

182
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:49,467
Yes, and I was amongst the tallest people at the time.

183
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,633
We used to train in the field at the back over there.

184
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,200
Outside?

185
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,933
On the ground.

186
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:09,266
There were some stones so it hurt when we fell.

187
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:16,266
There used to be a sewing school there,

188
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:23,266
so sometimes, there were needles on the ground.

189
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:31,633
It hurt a lot!

190
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,200
Now there are tatami so it is like practicing on pillows.

191
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,900
You never injured yourselves?

192
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,433
We had nothing at that time,

193
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,966
but the wooden floor was flexible enough so we were ok.

194
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:53,433
We bounced like on cushions!

195
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,567
We wanted a sandbag but we had no money.

196
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,033
It was expensive.

197
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:09,633
So we used to take a big grain bag,

198
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,500
and fill it with gravel.

199
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,600
We used to charge into it,

200
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:21,000
like rugby players.

201
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,000
We went that far in order to train.
