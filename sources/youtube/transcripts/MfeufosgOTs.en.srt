333
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:21,349
not robbing it's just this adhesion then
but when I get here yeah

334
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:21,359
but when I get here yeah
 

335
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,599
but when I get here yeah
send it same thing same thing just like

336
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:26,609
send it same thing same thing just like
 

337
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:32,060
send it same thing same thing just like
sort work okay zero pressure he wants to

338
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,070
sort work okay zero pressure he wants to
 

339
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,369
sort work okay zero pressure he wants to
go forward I just follow him forward

340
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:34,379
go forward I just follow him forward
 

341
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,249
go forward I just follow him forward
we're not bidding see he wants to go

342
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:37,259
we're not bidding see he wants to go
 

343
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,029
we're not bidding see he wants to go
back he's going to you yeah he

344
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
back he's going to you yeah he
 

345
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,720
back he's going to you yeah he
wants to go out

346
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,730
wants to go out
 

347
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:48,159
wants to go out
no he wants to come in no okay come on

348
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:48,169
no he wants to come in no okay come on
 

349
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:55,009
no he wants to come in no okay come on
so you're going here yeah no cheer okay

350
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:55,019
so you're going here yeah no cheer okay
 

351
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,149
so you're going here yeah no cheer okay
a bomb pop the elbow I go below you can

352
00:18:59,149 --> 00:18:59,159
a bomb pop the elbow I go below you can
 

353
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,320
a bomb pop the elbow I go below you can
do above I'm here like this if he

354
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,330
do above I'm here like this if he
 

355
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,190
do above I'm here like this if he
bends his arm

356
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
bends his arm
 

357
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,570
bends his arm
it doesn't mom I still have that okay so

358
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:08,580
it doesn't mom I still have that okay so
 

359
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:20,639
it doesn't mom I still have that okay so
here here from that here

360
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:20,649

 

361
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:28,690

boom from that trap so it looks like I'm

362
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:28,700
boom from that trap so it looks like I'm
 

363
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:37,080
boom from that trap so it looks like I'm
not loading him but I am good move move

364
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,090
not loading him but I am good move move
 

365
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,639
not loading him but I am good move move
you see it's no different than the sword

366
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:42,649
you see it's no different than the sword
 

367
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,999
you see it's no different than the sword
the sword is stuck to the sword okay

368
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:46,009
the sword is stuck to the sword okay
 

369
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,289
the sword is stuck to the sword okay
he can only pull away but I just stand

370
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:50,299
he can only pull away but I just stand
 

371
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:55,019

373
00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:01,989
with okay try to describe a Jian the try
okay it's you're still external yes I

374
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:01,999
okay it's you're still external yes I
 

375
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,719
okay it's you're still external yes I
have contact yes I have contact

376
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:04,729
have contact yes I have contact
 

377
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:09,339

yes I have a drawn vector but the energy

378
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:09,349
yes I have a drawn vector but the energy
 

379
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:12,519
yes I have a drawn vector but the energy
that I'm generating in the Kazushi is

380
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:12,529
that I'm generating in the Kazushi is
 

381
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,560
that I'm generating in the Kazushi is
also has to be calculated okay so and

382
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:17,570
also has to be calculated okay so and
 

383
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,200
also has to be calculated okay so and
we're just standing here that's going to

384
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,210
we're just standing here that's going to
 

385
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,479
we're just standing here that's going to
be a totally different amount of

386
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:22,489
be a totally different amount of
 

387
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,399
be a totally different amount of
pressure each hand is doing and each

388
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:24,409
pressure each hand is doing and each
 

389
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:27,940

vector in order to stay stuck as he's

390
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:27,950
vector in order to stay stuck as he's
 

391
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,239
vector in order to stay stuck as he's
starting to move that's a different

392
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:31,249
starting to move that's a different
 

393
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:33,879
starting to move that's a different
pressure value on the top and a

394
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:33,889
pressure value on the top and a
 

395
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,310
pressure value on the top and a
different vector on each hand in order

396
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
different vector on each hand in order
 

397
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,070
different vector on each hand in order
to stay stuck and same thing as he falls

398
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,080
to stay stuck and same thing as he falls
 

399
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,839
to stay stuck and same thing as he falls
so I can I go it's a value 10 vector Y

400
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:43,849
so I can I go it's a value 10 vector Y
 

401
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,519
so I can I go it's a value 10 vector Y
but then when he falls

402
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:45,529
but then when he falls
 

403
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,060
but then when he falls
you see you lost it you see that it's a

404
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,070
you see you lost it you see that it's a
 

405
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,369
you see you lost it you see that it's a
constant changing what am i changing I'm

he tries what if you just work on a

410
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:02,299
he tries what if you just work on a

okay if he pushes into me you'll feel

414
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:07,340
okay if he pushes into me you'll feel
 

415
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,859
okay if he pushes into me you'll feel
the IP on this hand

416
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:08,869
the IP on this hand
 

417
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,259
the IP on this hand
do you feel that and then the kokyu on

418
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:11,269
do you feel that and then the kokyu on
 

419
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,430
do you feel that and then the kokyu on
this hand okay so this line this way is

okay you got it if he goes far over he's

432
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
okay you got it if he goes far over he's
 

433
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,670
okay you got it if he goes far over he's
going to feel I'll hook you on this hand

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,250
knee and that's where you guys are
 

459
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,670

around here this part you're worried to

462
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,490
around here this part you're worried to
 

463
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,290
around here this part you're worried to
do you see that because you don't have

464
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,300
do you see that because you don't have
 

465
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,130
do you see that because you don't have
them in him trapped in the cross you're

466
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,140
them in him trapped in the cross you're
 

467
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,550
them in him trapped in the cross you're
like cuz there's nothing there a regular

468
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:33,560
like cuz there's nothing there a regular
 

469
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,680
like cuz there's nothing there a regular
it's like it's on and then it's off

470
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:35,690
it's like it's on and then it's off
 

471
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,560
it's like it's on and then it's off
there's nothing there but here all this

472
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,570
there's nothing there but here all this
 

473
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,860
there's nothing there but here all this
is a lot all this is a lot it's nothing

he's trapped in that cross okay

476
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:51,590

 

477
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,800

so don't race it if you're shooting for

478
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:54,810
so don't race it if you're shooting for
 

479
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:31,610
so don't race it if you're shooting for
that car okay let's go do it today but
