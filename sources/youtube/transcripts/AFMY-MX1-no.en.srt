alignments and mechanics we're gonna use
 

17
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,970
alignments and mechanics we're gonna use
in order to do that and the strongest

in order to do that and the strongest
 

19
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,470
in order to do that and the strongest
position we can be generally is with

demonstration of how to eat and talk
 

37
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,680
demonstration of how to eat and talk
about how that works with some of the

38
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,690
about how that works with some of the
 

39
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,299
about how that works with some of the
principles we've already explored this

40
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,309
principles we've already explored this
 

41
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,420
principles we've already explored this
week all right so here we're going to

42
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,430
week all right so here we're going to
 

43
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,630
week all right so here we're going to
have a classic icater demonstration so

44
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
have a classic icater demonstration so
 

45
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,920
have a classic icater demonstration so
she's going to use some Huta ghee in

46
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:54,930
she's going to use some Huta ghee in
 

47
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,389
she's going to use some Huta ghee in
order to do this she's gonna use a lot

48
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
order to do this she's gonna use a lot
 

49
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,310
order to do this she's gonna use a lot
of the principles that we just discussed

50
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
of the principles that we just discussed
 

51
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,880
of the principles that we just discussed
right

52
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:58,890
right
 

53
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,709
right
so one principle she's gonna use is

54
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
so one principle she's gonna use is
 

55
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,689
so one principle she's gonna use is
she's gonna lengthen the leverage that

56
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:02,699
she's gonna lengthen the leverage that
 

57
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,340
she's gonna lengthen the leverage that
those guys have to deal with right so

58
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,350
those guys have to deal with right so
 

59
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,240
those guys have to deal with right so
they're gonna she's going to move

60
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,250
they're gonna she's going to move
 

61
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,219
they're gonna she's going to move
herself really far away from those kind

62
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:07,229
herself really far away from those kind
 

63
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,230
herself really far away from those kind
of lifting and she's also going to cause

64
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
of lifting and she's also going to cause
 

65
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,880
of lifting and she's also going to cause
them to house some distraction in the

66
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:10,890
them to house some distraction in the
 

67
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,530
them to house some distraction in the
force that are putting in so first thing

68
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:12,540
force that are putting in so first thing
 

69
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,670
force that are putting in so first thing
we're gonna do is have you guys go ahead

70
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
we're gonna do is have you guys go ahead
 

71
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,260
we're gonna do is have you guys go ahead
with Sasha

72
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,270

 

73
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,899

I'm pretty easy for them to do that this

74
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:21,909
I'm pretty easy for them to do that this
 

75
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,510
I'm pretty easy for them to do that this
time when Sasha doesn't or when we do it

76
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,520
time when Sasha doesn't or when we do it
 

77
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,160
time when Sasha doesn't or when we do it
we're gonna have to flip some shops and

78
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,170
we're gonna have to flip some shops and
 

79
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,200
we're gonna have to flip some shops and
some she's gonna force herself down so

80
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,210
some she's gonna force herself down so
 

81
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,120
some she's gonna force herself down so
these guys are done really is to keep

82
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,130
these guys are done really is to keep
 

83
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,920
these guys are done really is to keep
her up in the air to keep her up so go

84
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:31,930
her up in the air to keep her up so go
 

85
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,810
her up in the air to keep her up so go
ahead and get it right up in the air all

86
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:33,820
ahead and get it right up in the air all
 

87
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,800
ahead and get it right up in the air all
right so I want you to bring yourself

88
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:34,810
right so I want you to bring yourself
 

89
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,779
right so I want you to bring yourself
down all right so now it seems

90
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:39,789
down all right so now it seems
 

91
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,609
down all right so now it seems
miraculous and magic because sasha was

92
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:41,619
miraculous and magic because sasha was
 

93
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,320
miraculous and magic because sasha was
already up in the air they have the big

94
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,330
already up in the air they have the big
 

95
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,149
already up in the air they have the big
advantage under and yet somehow she's

96
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:45,159
advantage under and yet somehow she's
 

97
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,070
advantage under and yet somehow she's
able to come down the way she's able to

98
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,080
able to come down the way she's able to
 

99
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,020
able to come down the way she's able to
do that she's disconnecting them from

100
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,030
do that she's disconnecting them from
 

101
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,120
do that she's disconnecting them from
her Center so it makes it hard for them

102
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,130
her Center so it makes it hard for them
 

103
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,830
her Center so it makes it hard for them
to live to her Center and she's reaching

104
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
to live to her Center and she's reaching
 

105
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,230
to live to her Center and she's reaching
out extending that lever so it's hard

106
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,240
out extending that lever so it's hard
 

107
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,449
out extending that lever so it's hard
for them to hold up so if someone to

108
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:57,459
for them to hold up so if someone to
 

109
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,010
for them to hold up so if someone to
keep herself on the ground she could do

110
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,020
keep herself on the ground she could do
 

111
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,749
keep herself on the ground she could do
that too so if these guys king tried to

112
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:00,759
that too so if these guys king tried to
 

113
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,249
that too so if these guys king tried to
pick her up now by using those same

114
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:02,259
pick her up now by using those same
 

115
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,020
pick her up now by using those same
techniques so she can keep herself with

116
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,030
techniques so she can keep herself with
 

117
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,190
techniques so she can keep herself with
ever getting up on the ground

118
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
ever getting up on the ground
 

119
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,359
ever getting up on the ground
they're both struggling really hard

120
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:06,369
they're both struggling really hard
 

121
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,590
they're both struggling really hard
right now they're gonna be out breathitt

122
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
right now they're gonna be out breathitt
 

123
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,999
right now they're gonna be out breathitt
as they can do people feel safe return

124
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,009
as they can do people feel safe return
 

125
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,490
as they can do people feel safe return
but this is the way that Sasha can keep

126
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,500
but this is the way that Sasha can keep
 

127
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,780
but this is the way that Sasha can keep
herself on the ground by disconnecting

128
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:12,790
herself on the ground by disconnecting
 

129
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,490
herself on the ground by disconnecting
her center from the way they're pushing

130
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,500
her center from the way they're pushing
 

131
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,470
her center from the way they're pushing
so again it looks like a miraculous

132
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
so again it looks like a miraculous
 

133
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,880
so again it looks like a miraculous
thing it and we can tell you all kinds

134
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:17,890
thing it and we can tell you all kinds
 

135
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,949
thing it and we can tell you all kinds
of magical powers or something to be had

136
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:19,959
of magical powers or something to be had
 

137
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,140
of magical powers or something to be had
but the truth is simply that sausage

138
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,150
but the truth is simply that sausage
 

139
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,870
but the truth is simply that sausage
using good mechanics glute leverage and

140
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:24,880
using good mechanics glute leverage and
 

141
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,210
using good mechanics glute leverage and
honey and we keep my body connected the

142
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,220
honey and we keep my body connected the
 

143
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,690
honey and we keep my body connected the
way she wants order to do these things
