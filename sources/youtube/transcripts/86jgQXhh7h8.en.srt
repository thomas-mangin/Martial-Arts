00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
here's the bottom of the triangle the
 

173
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,350
here's the bottom of the triangle the
top is over on the other side of his hip

174
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
top is over on the other side of his hip
 

175
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:37,189
top is over on the other side of his hip
and this your hip that's where I step

176
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199

 

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,309

in

178
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319

 

179
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,830

open you can you see this triangle where

180
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:44,840
open you can you see this triangle where
 

181
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,469
open you can you see this triangle where
I'm going to go we're going to go over

182
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
I'm going to go we're going to go over
 

183
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,749
I'm going to go we're going to go over
here okay that's where I

184
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759

 

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,670

drop don't step out of your

186
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
drop don't step out of your
 

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,309
drop don't step out of your
grip this

188
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:01,319
grip this
 

189
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,430
grip this
no this is a line the line doesn't work

190
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
no this is a line the line doesn't work
 

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,869
no this is a line the line doesn't work
when he's going flying by you because

192
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:07,879
when he's going flying by you because
 

193
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,710
when he's going flying by you because
he'll pass

194
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720

 

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,950

me you want a circle to your Technique

196
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:15,960
me you want a circle to your Technique
 

197
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,029
me you want a circle to your Technique
and the circle is really a spinning

198
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:18,039
and the circle is really a spinning
 

199
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,710
and the circle is really a spinning
triangle okay so you

200
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:23,720

 

201
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,510

rotate so it's kind of like he's going

202
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
rotate so it's kind of like he's going
 

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,909
rotate so it's kind of like he's going
to go around me

204
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:30,919
to go around me
 

205
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,990
to go around me
you guys understand when I'm a triangle

206
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
you guys understand when I'm a triangle
 

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,469
you guys understand when I'm a triangle
but imagine you have a triangle with an

208
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
but imagine you have a triangle with an
 

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,390
but imagine you have a triangle with an
axis in the middle you spin it it's

210
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,400
axis in the middle you spin it it's
 

211
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,710
axis in the middle you spin it it's
going to replicate a rotational energy a

212
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:41,720
going to replicate a rotational energy a
 

213
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,670
going to replicate a rotational energy a
circle okay so that's what I'm trying to

214
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
circle okay so that's what I'm trying to
 

215
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,350
circle okay so that's what I'm trying to
do he's trying to

216
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
do he's trying to
 

217
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,309
do he's trying to
go around

218
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
go around
 

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,629
go around
me he's not passing me in the

220
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
me he's not passing me in the
 

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,469
me he's not passing me in the
night so I don't want to just change

222
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:55,479
night so I don't want to just change
 

223
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,710
night so I don't want to just change
direction I go this way and then I go

224
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
direction I go this way and then I go
 

225
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,270
direction I go this way and then I go
that way no that's not going to work

226
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
that way no that's not going to work
 

227
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,589
that way no that's not going to work
you make that spinning triangle

228
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599

 

229
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,149

W the spinning triangle will bring the

230
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:09,159
W the spinning triangle will bring the
 

231
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,149
W the spinning triangle will bring the
weight back to your Center you see cuz

232
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,159
weight back to your Center you see cuz
 

233
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,390
weight back to your Center you see cuz
my

234
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:13,400
my
 

235
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,790
my
hand is I'm not as heavy out there as I

236
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
hand is I'm not as heavy out there as I
 

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,790
hand is I'm not as heavy out there as I
am here underneath my Center so I put my

238
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:21,800

 

239
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,270

Center so my hand gets back to my Center

240
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
Center so my hand gets back to my Center
 

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,230
Center so my hand gets back to my Center
underneath it spinning

242
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
underneath it spinning
 

243
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,710
underneath it spinning
triangle

244
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:31,720

 

245
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,389

[Music]

246
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:35,399

 

247
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:54,030

okay let's

248
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,040

 

249
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,829

go

250
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839

 

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,590

right right

252
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600

 

253
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:21,750

he get your g hi

254
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760

 

255
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760

something
