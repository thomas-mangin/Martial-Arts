the same way that my step out so take
 

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,030
the same way that my step out so take
that pressure push there it is that

46
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,040
that pressure push there it is that
 

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,990
that pressure push there it is that
pressure had I have been able to step

48
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
pressure had I have been able to step
 

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,910
pressure had I have been able to step
out you see it

50

neutralized or take the pressure right
 

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,029
neutralized or take the pressure right
and I go this way and then that way I

54
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039
and I go this way and then that way I
 

55
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,389
and I go this way and then that way I
I'm changing it with my steps my

56
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
I'm changing it with my steps my

here okay so I increase the Yang value

64
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
here okay so I increase the Yang value
 

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,830
here okay so I increase the Yang value
internalizing it you see and then I

66
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:18,840
internalizing it you see and then I
 

67
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,869
internalizing it you see and then I
decide what will work within this okay

68
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
decide what will work within this okay
