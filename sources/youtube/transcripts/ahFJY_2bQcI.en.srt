00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,820
it you get that crushing all the time in
body alright okay you're not moving your

226
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:23,830
body alright okay you're not moving your
 

227
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,140
body alright okay you're not moving your
body you're not moving your body you're

228

just moving your eyes same exact thing
 

231
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,380
just moving your eyes same exact thing
so here in this case I'm picking up I'm

232
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,390
so here in this case I'm picking up I'm
 

233
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,110
so here in this case I'm picking up I'm
dropping the tip it is true but my hands

234
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
dropping the tip it is true but my hands
 

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,350
dropping the tip it is true but my hands
aren't they so my hands had to be picked

236
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:38,360
aren't they so my hands had to be picked
 

237
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,200
aren't they so my hands had to be picked
up by my Center being picked up not by

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,210
up by my Center being picked up not by
 

239
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,650
up by my Center being picked up not by
my my sword dropping and my centerline

240
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:44,660
my my sword dropping and my centerline
 

241
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,410
my my sword dropping and my centerline
staying still no so but there's a

242
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,420
staying still no so but there's a
 

243
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,800
staying still no so but there's a
flexion that happens at the beginning

244
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:49,810
flexion that happens at the beginning
 

245
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,230
flexion that happens at the beginning
can you see the swelling and it moves

246
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
can you see the swelling and it moves
 

247
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,720
can you see the swelling and it moves
them it moves the weapon it's not just

248
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,730
them it moves the weapon it's not just
 

249
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,310
them it moves the weapon it's not just
in hand okay I have to inhale it away

250
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
in hand okay I have to inhale it away
 

251
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,620
in hand okay I have to inhale it away
boom that like that uh and I reinforced

252
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:05,630
boom that like that uh and I reinforced
 

253
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,240
boom that like that uh and I reinforced
so you're just gonna boom right so I

254
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,250
so you're just gonna boom right so I
 

255
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,340
so you're just gonna boom right so I
that's the same inhaling that I'm doing

256
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,350
that's the same inhaling that I'm doing
 

257
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,170
that's the same inhaling that I'm doing
here okay I'm starting the movement I'm

258

here okay I'm starting the movement I'm
 

259
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,810
here okay I'm starting the movement I'm
inhaling to get that swell going that's

260
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:19,820
inhaling to get that swell going that's
 

261
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,590
inhaling to get that swell going that's
what it kicks up my hands then the sword

262
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600

267
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,600
the sword tip wants to fall I don't make
it fall you see that difference I let it

268
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,610
it fall you see that difference I let it
 

269
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,920
it fall you see that difference I let it
fall so I pick up my hand and the sword

270
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:38,930
fall so I pick up my hand and the sword
 

271
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,230

now as I start to step right I'm gonna

284
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,070
now as I start to step right I'm gonna
 

285
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,140
now as I start to step right I'm gonna
get underneath it just like okay you

286
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,150
get underneath it just like okay you
 

287
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,400
