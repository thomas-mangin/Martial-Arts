hello I'm Christopher Hine and today
we're going to be talking about the ice

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
we're going to be talking about the ice
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,110
we're going to be talking about the ice
pick grip and what the ice pick grip is

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
pick grip and what the ice pick grip is
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,430
pick grip and what the ice pick grip is
uh I call it a reverse grip usually so

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
uh I call it a reverse grip usually so
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,430
uh I call it a reverse grip usually so
when you have a knife in your hand

10
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,440
when you have a knife in your hand
 

11
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,990
when you have a knife in your hand
either it sticks out the four side the

12
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
either it sticks out the four side the
 

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,430
either it sticks out the four side the
front side or the back side the reverse

14
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
front side or the back side the reverse
 

15
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,910
front side or the back side the reverse
side um so I'm going to talk a little

16
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:18,920
side um so I'm going to talk a little
 

17
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,269
side um so I'm going to talk a little
bit about the knife disarms I use for um

18
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:22,279
bit about the knife disarms I use for um
 

19
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,589
bit about the knife disarms I use for um
reverse grip which are basically

20
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:23,599
reverse grip which are basically
 

21
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,189
reverse grip which are basically
essentially the same as the other ones

22
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
essentially the same as the other ones
 

23
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,550
essentially the same as the other ones
but I'll kind of give you some detail on

24
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
but I'll kind of give you some detail on
 

25
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,910
but I'll kind of give you some detail on
them we'll talk a little bit about them

26
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
them we'll talk a little bit about them
 

27
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,990
them we'll talk a little bit about them
so I'm going to get Josh over here we're

28
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,000
so I'm going to get Josh over here we're
 

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,390
so I'm going to get Josh over here we're
going to go to work Josh

30
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:32,400

 

31
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,140

37
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,549

all right so let's talk about the

38
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:51,559
all right so let's talk about the
 

39
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,470
all right so let's talk about the
reverse grip so understand reverse grip

40
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,480
reverse grip so understand reverse grip
 

41
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,270
reverse grip so understand reverse grip
and forgrip are roughly the same when it

42
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
and forgrip are roughly the same when it
 

43
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,990
and forgrip are roughly the same when it
comes to doing disarms with them uh one

44
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,000
comes to doing disarms with them uh one
 

45
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,389
comes to doing disarms with them uh one
important thing to understand is a

46
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
important thing to understand is a
 

47
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,029
important thing to understand is a
reverse grip seriously limits your

48
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
reverse grip seriously limits your
 

49
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,830
reverse grip seriously limits your
striking range um so if I was here with

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
striking range um so if I was here with
 

51
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,749
striking range um so if I was here with
Josh and I'm just barely in Striking

52
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:07,759
Josh and I'm just barely in Striking
 

53
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,190
Josh and I'm just barely in Striking
range here right so if I moved I'd cut

54
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
range here right so if I moved I'd cut
 

55
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,910
range here right so if I moved I'd cut
him now I'm not going to change anything

56
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:10,920
him now I'm not going to change anything
 

57
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,749
him now I'm not going to change anything
but the grip okay so I just changed the

58
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:12,759
but the grip okay so I just changed the
 

59
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,230
but the grip okay so I just changed the
grip and now I'm about six inches from

60
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
grip and now I'm about six inches from
 

61
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,070
grip and now I'm about six inches from
Josh's neck so he is way further away

62
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,080
Josh's neck so he is way further away
 

63
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,710
Josh's neck so he is way further away
from me than he was before okay uh

64
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:19,720
from me than he was before okay uh
 

65
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,069
from me than he was before okay uh
because of the position of the knife

66
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:21,079
because of the position of the knife
 

67
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,510
because of the position of the knife
that's it so when maximum distance is

68
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
that's it so when maximum distance is
 

69
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,030
that's it so when maximum distance is
important to me I want to be in a four

70
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
important to me I want to be in a four
 

71
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,830
important to me I want to be in a four
grip and not in a reverse grip most aita

72
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:26,840
grip and not in a reverse grip most aita
 

73
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,830
grip and not in a reverse grip most aita
schools use the four grip and don't use

74
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
schools use the four grip and don't use
 

75
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,749
schools use the four grip and don't use
the reverse grip probably for this very

76
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:30,759
the reverse grip probably for this very
 

77
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,230
the reverse grip probably for this very
reason because making distance is

78
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
reason because making distance is
 

79
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,710
reason because making distance is
essentially what we want to do whether

80
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720
essentially what we want to do whether
 

81
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,550
essentially what we want to do whether
we're offensive or defensive with the

82
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:35,560
we're offensive or defensive with the
 

83
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,190
we're offensive or defensive with the
knife um now when I am coming over head

84
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,200
knife um now when I am coming over head
 

85
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,190
knife um now when I am coming over head
strikes this is much more comfortable

86
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
strikes this is much more comfortable
 

87
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,830
strikes this is much more comfortable
than this so because we have yokan and

88
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
than this so because we have yokan and
 

89
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,749
than this so because we have yokan and
Showman's putting it in the reverse grip

90
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
Showman's putting it in the reverse grip
 

91
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,469
Showman's putting it in the reverse grip
is going to make more sense for a lot of

92
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:47,479
is going to make more sense for a lot of
 

93
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,789
is going to make more sense for a lot of
people and especially when you start

94
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
people and especially when you start
 

95
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,069
people and especially when you start
moving into free practice you're going

96
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
moving into free practice you're going
 

97
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,749
moving into free practice you're going
to see this happening a lot although a

98
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
to see this happening a lot although a
 

99
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,950
to see this happening a lot although a
lot of people get in this position just

100
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
lot of people get in this position just
 

101
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,069
lot of people get in this position just
because they think it's cool right it's

102
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
because they think it's cool right it's
 

103
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,109
because they think it's cool right it's
a cool position generally it's it's not

104
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:56,119
a cool position generally it's it's not
 

105
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,709
a cool position generally it's it's not
great unless you're up close or coming

106
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:57,719
great unless you're up close or coming
 

107
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,990
great unless you're up close or coming
down directly with these attacks so use

108
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
down directly with these attacks so use
 

109
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,389
down directly with these attacks so use
Niko all right so uh as Josh comes down

110
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
Niko all right so uh as Josh comes down
 

111
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,749
Niko all right so uh as Josh comes down
I'm going to use the same basic thing

112
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
I'm going to use the same basic thing
 

113
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,870
I'm going to use the same basic thing
before so he used a yokan here's my UD

114
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:07,880
before so he used a yokan here's my UD
 

115
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,869
before so he used a yokan here's my UD
sanaku there's the knife and I I'm I'm

116
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:09,879
sanaku there's the knife and I I'm I'm
 

117
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,110
sanaku there's the knife and I I'm I'm
readily available to to get to it okay

118
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
readily available to to get to it okay
 

119
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,790
readily available to to get to it okay
now if I were to drive him down like

120
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
now if I were to drive him down like
 

121
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,070
now if I were to drive him down like
this okay as I drive it down we get

122
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,080
this okay as I drive it down we get
 

123
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,670
this okay as I drive it down we get
kotay here exactly the same as we would

124
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
kotay here exactly the same as we would
 

125
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,830
kotay here exactly the same as we would
get it in the foregrip right so it's

126
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
get it in the foregrip right so it's
 

127
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,990
get it in the foregrip right so it's
different in like uh in in his hand like

128
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,000
different in like uh in in his hand like
 

129
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,270
different in like uh in in his hand like
the way he's holding it but for me it's

130
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
the way he's holding it but for me it's
 

131
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,229
the way he's holding it but for me it's
exactly the same strip no different

132
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:29,239
exactly the same strip no different
 

133
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,070
exactly the same strip no different
right now I might have to use the flat

134
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
right now I might have to use the flat
 

135
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,670
right now I might have to use the flat
of the blade more or use the backside of

136
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
of the blade more or use the backside of
 

137
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,430
of the blade more or use the backside of
the blade more because I don't have a

138
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
the blade more because I don't have a
 

139
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,309
the blade more because I don't have a
handle here as nicely to slide up kind

140
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
handle here as nicely to slide up kind
 

141
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,470
handle here as nicely to slide up kind
of depends these are short-handled

142
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
of depends these are short-handled
 

143
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,589
of depends these are short-handled
knives so these are actually pretty

144
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:38,599
knives so these are actually pretty
 

145
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,070
knives so these are actually pretty
challenging for this but a longer

146
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
challenging for this but a longer
 

147
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,509
challenging for this but a longer
handled knife it's going to give me a

148
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
handled knife it's going to give me a
 

149
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,830
handled knife it's going to give me a
little more control over that but that's

150
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
little more control over that but that's
 

151
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,830
little more control over that but that's
exactly the same let's say it came gaku

152
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:44,840
exactly the same let's say it came gaku
 

153
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,990
exactly the same let's say it came gaku
yokuman like this okay Niko is also

154
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
yokuman like this okay Niko is also
 

155
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,710
yokuman like this okay Niko is also
right there exactly the same so here it

156
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:49,720
right there exactly the same so here it
 

157
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,390
right there exactly the same so here it
is Boom there's Niko strips out in my

158
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
is Boom there's Niko strips out in my
 

159
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,630
is Boom there's Niko strips out in my
hand exactly the same so that's really

160
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
