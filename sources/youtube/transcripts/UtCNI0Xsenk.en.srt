00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:00,590

 

225
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:07,600

okay let's go okay so that is a training

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,610
okay let's go okay so that is a training
 

227
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,340
okay let's go okay so that is a training
model remember I told you is not a

228
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,350
model remember I told you is not a
 

229

the technique the technique is here I

232
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,190
the technique the technique is here I
 

233
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,310
the technique the technique is here I
have to figure out as he's going slow

234
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
have to figure out as he's going slow
 

235
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,290
have to figure out as he's going slow
motion how do I get on this side of his

236
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,300
motion how do I get on this side of his
 

237
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,990
motion how do I get on this side of his
weapon on this side at the end moment so

238
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,000
weapon on this side at the end moment so
 

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,540
weapon on this side at the end moment so
I can't be doing things with my weapon

240

moving it left to right can't happen so

242
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,390
moving it left to right can't happen so
 

243
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,769
moving it left to right can't happen so
when we go slow he he is aligned and my

244
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:47,779
when we go slow he he is aligned and my
 

245
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,019
when we go slow he he is aligned and my
job is not to move the line you see that

246
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,029
job is not to move the line you see that
 

247
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,269
job is not to move the line you see that
so I'm gonna go around I'm gonna go

248
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
so I'm gonna go around I'm gonna go
 

249
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,670
so I'm gonna go around I'm gonna go
around it you see I'm gonna go around it

250
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
around it you see I'm gonna go around it
 

251
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,710
around it you see I'm gonna go around it
you see I'm not gonna move it over here

252
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
you see I'm not gonna move it over here
 

253
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,120
you see I'm not gonna move it over here
go back if it just goes down and I allow

254
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,130
go back if it just goes down and I allow
 

255
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:11,710
go back if it just goes down and I allow
the Atocha to do its job she drop you

are confusing displacement with

258
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,450
are confusing displacement with
 

259
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,530
are confusing displacement with
replacement they're not the same so I

260
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:17,540
replacement they're not the same so I
 

261
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,440
replacement they're not the same so I
moved so that I can go around it without

262
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,450
moved so that I can go around it without
 

263
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,710
moved so that I can go around it without
lifting it without breaking connection

264
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:23,720
lifting it without breaking connection
 

265
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:34,270
lifting it without breaking connection
I'm using him as a guide okay let's go

266
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,280

over the Jo okay let's go so aside from
 

369
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,939
over the Jo okay let's go so aside from
the parallel waiting that use that you

370
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:48,949
the parallel waiting that use that you

guys we talked about there's ways you're

372
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:51,500
guys we talked about there's ways you're
 

373
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,150

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,160
making your Jo library so one common way
 

375
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,920
making your Jo library so one common way
is that you're going to pull the right

architectural non Ruby center but you
 

447
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,289
architectural non Ruby center but you
actually have a gooey Center
