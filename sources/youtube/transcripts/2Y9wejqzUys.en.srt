1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,050

so

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,060
so
 

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,510
so
if I said oh I want you to all catch the

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
if I said oh I want you to all catch the
 

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,289
if I said oh I want you to all catch the
bus

6
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:06,299
bus
 

7
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,990
bus
and it's it's going to be just outside

8
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,000
and it's it's going to be just outside
 

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,870
and it's it's going to be just outside
there just outside those doors so that's

10
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
there just outside those doors so that's
 

11
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,209
there just outside those doors so that's
why I went into way then the bus comes

12
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:14,219
why I went into way then the bus comes
 

13
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,970
why I went into way then the bus comes
and it stops over there but because she

14
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:16,980
and it stops over there but because she
 

15
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,470
and it stops over there but because she
was told

16
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
was told
 

17
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,150
was told
stand there you're standing there

18
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
stand there you're standing there
 

19
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,330
stand there you're standing there
waiting the bus the bus goes off

20
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:23,340
waiting the bus the bus goes off
 

21
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,429
waiting the bus the bus goes off
and you're left not on the bus and you

22
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
and you're left not on the bus and you
 

23
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,290
and you're left not on the bus and you
go well I don't know we were told to

24
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,300
go well I don't know we were told to
 

25
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,870
go well I don't know we were told to
stand there

26
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:29,880

 

27
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,910

so whoever told you

28
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
so whoever told you
 

29
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,310
so whoever told you
didn't check to make sure where the bus

30
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
didn't check to make sure where the bus
 

31
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,290
didn't check to make sure where the bus
really stopped right so that's a simple

32
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:36,300
really stopped right so that's a simple
 

33
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,990

analogy about what I'm saying and so

34
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
analogy about what I'm saying and so
 

35
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,610

let's watch some of your seniors do this
 

43
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,410
let's watch some of your seniors do this
right you're doing that and then you're

44
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,420
right you're doing that and then you're
 

45
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,850
right you're doing that and then you're
doing that

46
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,860
doing that
 

47
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,189
doing that
but this is the part

48
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
but this is the part
 

49
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,049
but this is the part
where the bus stop

50
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059

is wrong because you can see my head
is wider than that gel isn't it

54
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
is wider than that gel isn't it
 

55
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,210
is wider than that gel isn't it
you'll see that my head is wider than

56
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,220
you'll see that my head is wider than
 

57
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,950
you'll see that my head is wider than

that job
so there's two answers here one is why

60
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
so there's two answers here one is why
 

61
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,609
so there's two answers here one is why

so to me

70
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:26,820
so to me
 

71
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,370
so to me
this is

72
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,380
this is
 

73
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,990
this is
correct

74
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000

you do this
are you kept on the same line all you've

124
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:44,099
are you kept on the same line all you've
 

125
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,390
are you kept on the same line all you've
done is avoided being up you've gained

126
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,400
done is avoided being up you've gained
 

127
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,309
done is avoided being up you've gained
nothing from it

128
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
nothing from it
 

129
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,309
nothing from it
what so if you gain from it

130
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
what so if you gain from it
 

131
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,369
what so if you gain from it
so we might all say yes we know that

132
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:58,379
so we might all say yes we know that
 

133
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,089
so we might all say yes we know that
we know we don't but so if my theory was

134
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:02,099
we know we don't but so if my theory was
 

135
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,949
we know we don't but so if my theory was
uh

136
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
uh
 

137
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,470
uh
I wouldn't have gained anything

138
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
I wouldn't have gained anything
 

139
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,050

to protect myself against his life okay
but that does

142
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:10,739
but that does
 

143
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:18,170
but that does
here

144
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180

 

145
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,449

so that's one of the facts huh I'm

146
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:20,459
so that's one of the facts huh I'm
 

147
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,250
so that's one of the facts huh I'm
getting off the line once the whole

148
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,260
getting off the line once the whole
 

149
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,130
getting off the line once the whole
principle like you know always get off

150
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,140
principle like you know always get off
 

151
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,290
principle like you know always get off
the line

152
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,300
the line
 

153
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,830
the line
