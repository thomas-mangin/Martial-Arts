so these little pokes

20
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600

 

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,450

not two different things
okay

36
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:54,840
okay
 

37
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,830

so on
castaguchi

40
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,559

 

41
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,950

it's always going to be through as many

42
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,960
it's always going to be through as many
 

43
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,710
it's always going to be through as many
planes as possible

44
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
planes as possible
 

45
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,469
planes as possible
so high width and depth

46
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
so high width and depth
 

47
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,310
so high width and depth
it's not simply a width strike

48
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
it's not simply a width strike
 

49
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,649
it's not simply a width strike
to get the height

50
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
to get the height
 

51
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,070
to get the height
it has to have a downwardness to it in

52
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
it has to have a downwardness to it in
 

53
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,690
it has to have a downwardness to it in
it

54
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:20,700
it
 

55
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,670
