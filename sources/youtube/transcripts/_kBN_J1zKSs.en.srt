00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:18,630
here like this I'm moving around the
 

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,759
here like this I'm moving around the
energy and going from one control to the

12
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:22,769
energy and going from one control to the
 

13
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,790
energy and going from one control to the
other room and I'm affecting his center

00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:27,800
other room and I'm affecting his center
 

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,389
other room and I'm affecting his center
by weight down see how I'm doing that

16
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:31,399
by weight down see how I'm doing that
 

17
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,310
by weight down see how I'm doing that

you're gonna pop up and come on control

20
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
you're gonna pop up and come on control
 

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,540
you're gonna pop up and come on control
affect his center okay and then we'll do

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:44,550
affect his center okay and then we'll do
 

23
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,990
affect his center okay and then we'll do
the second part just the mechanics get

00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
the second part just the mechanics get
 

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,130
the second part just the mechanics get
in position

26
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,140
in position

28
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,860
tight control move it center again right
 

29
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,959
tight control move it center again right
rule crane so slow go around the energy

30
00:00:58,959 --> 00:00:58,969
rule crane so slow go around the energy
 

31
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,599
rule crane so slow go around the energy
get the mechanics part to move from your

32
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:02,609
get the mechanics part to move from your
 

33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:10,360

trying to push and I'm grounding him
 

45
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,200
trying to push and I'm grounding him
right then I'm gonna let the energy

46
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,210
right then I'm gonna let the energy
 

47
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,500
right then I'm gonna let the energy
right this is just easy me nakia same

48
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,510
right this is just easy me nakia same
 

49
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,630
right this is just easy me nakia same
thing so his energy he's pushing right

50
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
thing so his energy he's pushing right
 

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,900
thing so his energy he's pushing right
and I'm gonna let it go around pass it

52
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:44,910
and I'm gonna let it go around pass it
 

53
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,900

power then apply some Mikey so he

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:18,570
power then apply some Mikey so he
 

73
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,750
power then apply some Mikey so he
started to overpower me but I want him

74
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,760
started to overpower me but I want him
 

75
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,390
started to overpower me but I want him
to go into it you see that I don't I

76
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,400
to go into it you see that I don't I
 

77
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,310
to go into it you see that I don't I
don't want to go here and then crank

78
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,320
don't want to go here and then crank
 

79
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:32,000
don't want to go here and then crank
like that I want him to fall into it so

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,010
like that I want him to fall into it so
 

81
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,100
like that I want him to fall into it so
the same thing whenever whenever I'm

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
part right remember not though I have to
 

89
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,690
part right remember not though I have to
cool effect his Center so the same thing

90
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
cool effect his Center so the same thing
 

91
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,300
cool effect his Center so the same thing
when I come in here and you're going to

92
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,310
when I come in here and you're going to
 

93
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,490
when I come in here and you're going to
lift our don't squeeze his neck use his

94
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:49,500
lift our don't squeeze his neck use his
 

95
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,040
lift our don't squeeze his neck use his
Center against the weight of the of his

96
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,050
Center against the weight of the of his
 

97
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,650
Center against the weight of the of his
neck so I'm gonna get in it such a way

98
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:54,660
neck so I'm gonna get in it such a way
 

99
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,690
neck so I'm gonna get in it such a way
it's boom then I'm picking up his Center

100
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
it's boom then I'm picking up his Center
 

101
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,030
it's boom then I'm picking up his Center
and it's not it's just like any coaching

102
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
and it's not it's just like any coaching
 

103
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,030
and it's not it's just like any coaching
knocking it's a matter of balance of

104
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,040
knocking it's a matter of balance of
 

105
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,710
knocking it's a matter of balance of
putting the foam room where you needed

106
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
putting the foam room where you needed
 

107
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,259
putting the foam room where you needed
to be then then the guy's not heavy so

108
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:06,269
to be then then the guy's not heavy so
 

109
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,020
to be then then the guy's not heavy so
if I go out here he's gonna get heavy so

110
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,030
if I go out here he's gonna get heavy so
 

111
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,090
if I go out here he's gonna get heavy so
I have to be in a place where I'm gonna

112
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,100
I have to be in a place where I'm gonna
 

113
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,300
I have to be in a place where I'm gonna
lift his Center again

114
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,310
lift his Center again
 

115
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,230
lift his Center again
he will feel the same as Ronan

116
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,240
he will feel the same as Ronan
 

117
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,450
he will feel the same as Ronan
okay let's go see I'm on it I'm on this

118
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:22,460
okay let's go see I'm on it I'm on this
 

119
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,400
okay let's go see I'm on it I'm on this
thing is that I have a duty belt on

120
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,410
thing is that I have a duty belt on
 

121
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,800
thing is that I have a duty belt on
right so I can't go like this

122
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:26,810
right so I can't go like this
 

123
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,510
right so I can't go like this
and give him all that okay so it's it's

124
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,520
and give him all that okay so it's it's
 

125
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,550
and give him all that okay so it's it's
over I'm on I'm on the front of him

126
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:33,560
over I'm on I'm on the front of him
 

127
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,040
over I'm on I'm on the front of him
right and now I'm on the side of him you

128
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,050
right and now I'm on the side of him you
 

129
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,800

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:41,810
see and if I cannot move but that wasn't
 

131
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,860
see and if I cannot move but that wasn't
the opening but I go here first you see

132
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:44,870
the opening but I go here first you see
 

133
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,580
the opening but I go here first you see
and he's pushing it so I'd go see here

134
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,590
and he's pushing it so I'd go see here
 

135
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,230
and he's pushing it so I'd go see here
do you guys see that difference okay so

136
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,240
do you guys see that difference okay so
 

137
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,730
do you guys see that difference okay so
what I'm seeing as soon as you go like

138
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:51,740
what I'm seeing as soon as you go like

this toe I got my baton am i again when

140
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:57,500
this toe I got my baton am i again when
 

141
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,890
this toe I got my baton am i again when
he feels like he's gonna get me he's

142
00:03:59,890 --> 00:03:59,900
he feels like he's gonna get me he's
 

143
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,450
he feels like he's gonna get me he's
gonna grab for all that and I'm not

144
