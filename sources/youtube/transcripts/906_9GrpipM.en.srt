okay that's his dilemma
i have his violence

188
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360

 

189
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,590

let's say i don't have this balance you

190
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
let's say i don't have this balance you
 

191
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,390
let's say i don't have this balance you
see

192
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
see
 

193
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,870
see

194
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
and i try to get his weapon
 

195
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,870
and i try to get his weapon
he can move any old way to stop the

196
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
he can move any old way to stop the
 

197
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,909
he can move any old way to stop the
prime

198
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
prime
 

199
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,309
prime
do you get it yes

200
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
do you get it yes
 

201
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,469
do you get it yes
so look how it wants to go this way you

202
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
so look how it wants to go this way you
 

203
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,790
so look how it wants to go this way you
see that if you move around this way

204
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
see that if you move around this way
 

205
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,029
see that if you move around this way
that's no longer the right angle

206
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
that's no longer the right angle
 

207
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,309
that's no longer the right angle
goes around

208
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
goes around
 

209
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,870
goes around
there it goes okay

210
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
there it goes okay
 

211
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,870
there it goes okay
so right here

212
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
so right here
 

213
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,430
so right here
i have the balance

214
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440

 

215
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,390

and he has to move that way if he stops

216
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
and he has to move that way if he stops
 

217
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,749
and he has to move that way if he stops
moving

218
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759

 

219
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,670

so you're moving to keep those balls and

220
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
so you're moving to keep those balls and
 

221
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,430
so you're moving to keep those balls and
that allows me to take the knife

222
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440

okay here we go
 

227
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,909
okay here we go
okay so again we we have the basic

228
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
okay so again we we have the basic
 

229
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,270
okay so again we we have the basic
bone pop basic turn it to its extreme

231
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,590
bone pop basic turn it to its extreme
probably down to the right angle i can

232
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
probably down to the right angle i can
 

233
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,830
probably down to the right angle i can
use different parts of my body to do the

234
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
use different parts of my body to do the
 

235
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,790
use different parts of my body to do the

236
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
prying
 

237
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,350
prying
and the tip then we moved a little bit

238
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
and the tip then we moved a little bit
 

239
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,790
and the tip then we moved a little bit
more advanced we pay attention to the

240
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
more advanced we pay attention to the
 

241
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,469
more advanced we pay attention to the

243
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,950
high key adhesion
pay attention

244
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
pay attention
 

245
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,950
pay attention
right here so you're not coming off the

246
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
right here so you're not coming off the
 

247
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,589
right here so you're not coming off the
weapon that won't be how you use it that

248
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
weapon that won't be how you use it that
 

249
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,150
weapon that won't be how you use it that
will not be how you find a disarm

250
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
will not be how you find a disarm
 

251
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,510
will not be how you find a disarm
okay

252
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
okay
 

253
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,350
okay
um

254
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
um
 

255
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,629
um
then

256
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
then
 

257
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,270
then
the tendency is the knife will preoccupy

258
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
the tendency is the knife will preoccupy
 

259
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,350
the tendency is the knife will preoccupy

start shrinking things
 

325
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,909
start shrinking things
first thing you realize that you start

326
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
first thing you realize that you start
 

327

to the outward vector
 

335
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,550
to the outward vector
will suffice

336
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560

 

337
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,550

i don't have to go all the way and

338
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
i don't have to go all the way and
 

339
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,949
i don't have to go all the way and
complete the grip to its

you can't do it right here

344
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200

 

345
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,670

so if i can do it right here

346
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680

 

347
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,990

then i can do it in any one i can do

348
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
then i can do it in any one i can do
 

349
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,509
then i can do it in any one i can do
here i can do it here i can do it here i

350
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
here i can do it here i can do it here i
 

351
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,430
here i can do it here i can do it here i
can do it here dude here doing here do

352
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
can do it here dude here doing here do
