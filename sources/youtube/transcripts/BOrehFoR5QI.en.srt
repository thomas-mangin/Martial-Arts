00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,310

all right so going into how to secure

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
all right so going into how to secure
 

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,189
all right so going into how to secure
the mount so this is the first point

6
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:16,199
the mount so this is the first point
 

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,429
the mount so this is the first point
okay and the first point is Discovery

8
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
okay and the first point is Discovery
 

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,990
okay and the first point is Discovery
learning so you're going to learn the

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
learning so you're going to learn the
 

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,470
learning so you're going to learn the
difference between tension and

12
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:23,480
difference between tension and
 

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,550
difference between tension and
relaxation and what it does to your

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560
relaxation and what it does to your
 

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,550
relaxation and what it does to your
perceived weight okay so he's going to

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
perceived weight okay so he's going to
 

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,790
perceived weight okay so he's going to
bench press me up and n10 and he can do

18
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
bench press me up and n10 and he can do
 

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,270
bench press me up and n10 and he can do
it pretty easily again just being what

20
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
it pretty easily again just being what
 

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,950
it pretty easily again just being what
you think is normal okay and then he'll

22
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
you think is normal okay and then he'll
 

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,910
you think is normal okay and then he'll
bench up and do it no problem okay it

24
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:42,920
bench up and do it no problem okay it
 

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,270
bench up and do it no problem okay it
doesn't matter if you're low I'm low

26
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
doesn't matter if you're low I'm low
 

27
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,510
doesn't matter if you're low I'm low
bench is up can do it no problem okay so

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:48,520
bench is up can do it no problem okay so
 

29
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,910
bench is up can do it no problem okay so
what you're going to do now in your

30
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
what you're going to do now in your
 

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,150
what you're going to do now in your
Discovery learning is just relax he goes

32
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
Discovery learning is just relax he goes
 

33
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:02,630
Discovery learning is just relax he goes
to bench

34
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640

 

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,990

and you're a lot

36
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,000
and you're a lot
 

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,149
and you're a lot
heavier understand the Instinct that

38
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,159
heavier understand the Instinct that
 

39
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,109
heavier understand the Instinct that
when you feel yourself to lift you might

40
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
when you feel yourself to lift you might
 

41
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,870
when you feel yourself to lift you might
tense up that's going to make you

42
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
tense up that's going to make you
 

43
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,109
tense up that's going to make you
liftable so when you feel that he's

44
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
liftable so when you feel that he's
 

45
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,990
liftable so when you feel that he's
lifting you that's the time to release

46
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
lifting you that's the time to release
 

47
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,149
lifting you that's the time to release
more and you get heavier so what what

48
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,159
more and you get heavier so what what
 

49
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,149
more and you get heavier so what what
did you

50
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
did you
 

51
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,670
did you
feel say it loud enough so the camera

52
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:20,680
feel say it loud enough so the camera
 

53
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,190
feel say it loud enough so the camera
can hear a lot of dead weight okay like

54
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
can hear a lot of dead weight okay like
 

55
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,429
can hear a lot of dead weight okay like
the weight was straight in your arms not

56
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
the weight was straight in your arms not
 

57
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,350
the weight was straight in your arms not
just for you sir yeah okay and and then

58
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
just for you sir yeah okay and and then
 

59
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,069
just for you sir yeah okay and and then
so

60
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
so
 

61
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,910
so
what happens is if the guy starts

62
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
what happens is if the guy starts
 

63
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,429
what happens is if the guy starts
lifting he starts wasting energy and you

64
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
lifting he starts wasting energy and you
 

65
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,109
lifting he starts wasting energy and you
make him enter into the fatigue cycle

66
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
make him enter into the fatigue cycle
 

67
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,230
make him enter into the fatigue cycle
okay and that's what we want to happen

68
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
okay and that's what we want to happen
 

69
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,389
okay and that's what we want to happen
Okay lesson to reinforcing the m is the

70
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
Okay lesson to reinforcing the m is the
 

71
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,069
Okay lesson to reinforcing the m is the
use of anchor points or leverage points

72
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,079
use of anchor points or leverage points
 

73
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,350
use of anchor points or leverage points
okay and uh you have under the head here

74
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,360
okay and uh you have under the head here
 

75
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,709
okay and uh you have under the head here
and the goal is not not to pick him up

76
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:55,719
and the goal is not not to pick him up
 

77
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,749
and the goal is not not to pick him up
the goal is for example if he's pushing

78
00:01:58,749 --> 00:01:58,759
the goal is for example if he's pushing
 

79
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,190
the goal is for example if he's pushing
me up that he picks his head up with me

80
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,200
me up that he picks his head up with me
 

81
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,749
me up that he picks his head up with me
okay so you don't want to burn your

82
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
okay so you don't want to burn your
 

83
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,389
okay so you don't want to burn your
bicep out another Anchor Point is either

84
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
bicep out another Anchor Point is either
 

85
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,550
bicep out another Anchor Point is either
the hook on one leg or the or the hook

86
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
the hook on one leg or the or the hook
 

87
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,750
the hook on one leg or the or the hook
or both legs

88
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:12,760
or both legs
 

89
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,270
or both legs
okay and then always reinforce this with

90
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
okay and then always reinforce this with
 

91
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,470
okay and then always reinforce this with
understanding your base of support okay

92
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,480
understanding your base of support okay
 

93
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,790
understanding your base of support okay
so you want it to be as wide as possible

94
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
so you want it to be as wide as possible
 

95
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,670
so you want it to be as wide as possible
and you want your post to be uh

96
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
and you want your post to be uh
 

97
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,070
and you want your post to be uh
reinforcing against the direction that

98
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
reinforcing against the direction that
 

99
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,350
reinforcing against the direction that
he might be trying to generate an angle

100
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,360
he might be trying to generate an angle
 

101
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,470
he might be trying to generate an angle
of disturbance so for example if if he's

102
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
of disturbance so for example if if he's
 

103
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,830
of disturbance so for example if if he's
trying to throw me this way to my this

104
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
trying to throw me this way to my this
 

105
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,190
trying to throw me this way to my this
way then he goes and the hook to the

106
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
way then he goes and the hook to the
 

107
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,750
way then he goes and the hook to the
head is going that way if I if he goes

108
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
head is going that way if I if he goes
 

109
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,830
head is going that way if I if he goes
that way again and he goes the other way

110
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
that way again and he goes the other way
 

111
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,190
that way again and he goes the other way
again then then you hook the head and

112
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
again then then you hook the head and
 

113
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,790
again then then you hook the head and
you can see that your post is out here

114
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,800
you can see that your post is out here
 

115

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,589
okay likewise you can see that I am
reinforcing this Great Vine over here

118
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
reinforcing this Great Vine over here
 

119
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,270
reinforcing this Great Vine over here
I'm kind of loose on this one you can

120
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm kind of loose on this one you can
 

121
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,110
I'm kind of loose on this one you can
even take it out to keep that knee to

122
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
even take it out to keep that knee to
 

123
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,750
even take it out to keep that knee to
reinforce that post on both sides okay

124
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
reinforce that post on both sides okay
 

125
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,670
reinforce that post on both sides okay
so I'm going to relax he's going to try

126
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
so I'm going to relax he's going to try
 

127
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,949
so I'm going to relax he's going to try
to push in different angles and I'm just

128
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
to push in different angles and I'm just
 

129
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,030
to push in different angles and I'm just
hooking basing brake

130
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
hooking basing brake
 

131
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,030
hooking basing brake
lining do for a while get

132
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,040

 

133
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,110

tired combining all of these things

134
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
tired combining all of these things
 

135
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,789
tired combining all of these things
to not waste

136
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:33,799
to not waste
 

137
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,789
to not waste
energy okay and make him again enter

138
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
energy okay and make him again enter
 

139
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,589
energy okay and make him again enter
deeper into the fatigue cycle right is

140
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
deeper into the fatigue cycle right is
 

141
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,429
deeper into the fatigue cycle right is
tiring yes sir is it tiring yes sir okay

142

I'll deframe him so they'll tend to push

146
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,080
I'll deframe him so they'll tend to push
 

147
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,509
I'll deframe him so they'll tend to push
on various places okay some are smart

148
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:52,519
on various places okay some are smart
 

149
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,350
on various places okay some are smart
and just some are stupid um and it's a

150
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
and just some are stupid um and it's a
 

151
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,990
and just some are stupid um and it's a
result that he can't he feels like he

152
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
result that he can't he feels like he
 

153
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,470
result that he can't he feels like he
can't get you off and he's getting more

can't get you off and he's getting more
 

155
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,949
can't get you off and he's getting more
and more more tired that's where they

156
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
and more more tired that's where they
 

157
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,229
and more more tired that's where they
make more mistakes okay so um I not not

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
doing is cupping it and moving it out of
 

173
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,230
doing is cupping it and moving it out of
the way

174
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,240
the way
 

175

okay um another one is is heel chest
 

177
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,350
okay um another one is is heel chest
push again you can make him enter deeper

178
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
push again you can make him enter deeper
 

179
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,350
push again you can make him enter deeper
into that cycle by make by for example

180
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
into that cycle by make by for example
 

181
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,230
into that cycle by make by for example
if we're here and I relax and especially

182
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
if we're here and I relax and especially
 

183
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,590
if we're here and I relax and especially
if I have a h head hook he'll never work

184
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:42,600
if I have a h head hook he'll never work
 

185
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,110
if I have a h head hook he'll never work
he'll never get it and he'll

186
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
he'll never get it and he'll
 

187
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,870
he'll never get it and he'll
stop well you can make him more fatigued

188
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
stop well you can make him more fatigued
 

189
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,310
stop well you can make him more fatigued
by making him think he's getting it by

190
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
by making him think he's getting it by
 

191
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,950
by making him think he's getting it by
fluctuating how much tension you have

192
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
fluctuating how much tension you have
 

193
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,590
fluctuating how much tension you have
and then you made him work and you'll

194
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,600
and then you made him work and you'll
 

195
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,629
and then you made him work and you'll
can swim in okay so he's here let just

196
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
can swim in okay so he's here let just
 

197
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,629
can swim in okay so he's here let just
show what I'm doing I'm just kind of

198
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
show what I'm doing I'm just kind of
 

199
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,950
show what I'm doing I'm just kind of
swimming in the shoulder and coming back

200
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
swimming in the shoulder and coming back
 

201
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,230
swimming in the shoulder and coming back
down to base

202
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,240
down to base
 

203
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,830
down to base
okay

204
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:06,840
okay
 

205
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,790
okay
um another one is I can use my body to

206
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,800
um another one is I can use my body to
 

207
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,070
um another one is I can use my body to
do all this kind of stuff so for example

208
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
do all this kind of stuff so for example
 

209
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,510
do all this kind of stuff so for example
he's pushing up I kind of get him going

210
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,520
he's pushing up I kind of get him going
 

211
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,629
he's pushing up I kind of get him going
and I just

212
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
and I just
 

213
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,710
and I just
turn he's there and I'm turning like

214
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
turn he's there and I'm turning like
 

215
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,029
turn he's there and I'm turning like
that and then I just kind of smash the

216
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:24,039
that and then I just kind of smash the
 

217
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,790
that and then I just kind of smash the
lack of Leverage that he had on the

218
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
lack of Leverage that he had on the
 

219
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,070
lack of Leverage that he had on the
chest push okay um so you you kind of

220
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
chest push okay um so you you kind of
 

221
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,990
chest push okay um so you you kind of
mix these things up he's going to go for

222
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
mix these things up he's going to go for
 

223
00:05:32,000 --> 00:06:03,230
mix these things up he's going to go for
a while

224
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240

 

225
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,990

and then you got him deeper into the

226
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,000
and then you got him deeper into the
 

227
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,469
and then you got him deeper into the
fatigue sidey right yes sir okay let's

228
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
fatigue sidey right yes sir okay let's
 

229
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,870
fatigue sidey right yes sir okay let's
try it okay this next one to help

230
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
try it okay this next one to help
 

231
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,830
try it okay this next one to help
reinforce m is arm isolations okay and

232
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
reinforce m is arm isolations okay and
 

233
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,189
reinforce m is arm isolations okay and
in essence you're trying to get his

234
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:18,199
in essence you're trying to get his
 

235
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,670
in essence you're trying to get his
elbows away from his torso is what

236
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:20,680
elbows away from his torso is what
 

237
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,110
elbows away from his torso is what
you're trying to do so uh we're going to

238
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
you're trying to do so uh we're going to
 

239
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,070
you're trying to do so uh we're going to
work on two

240
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,080
work on two
 

241
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,710
work on two
okay um you can see I did it came out

242
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
okay um you can see I did it came out
 

243
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,309
okay um you can see I did it came out
last time so as as he goes to he's

244
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:31,319
last time so as as he goes to he's
 

245
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,270
last time so as as he goes to he's
pushing right and I came this way okay

246
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
pushing right and I came this way okay
 

247
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,150
pushing right and I came this way okay
and you can crawl

248
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
and you can crawl
 

249
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,909
and you can crawl
up this way okay and now you can hold it

250
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
up this way okay and now you can hold it
 

251
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,870
up this way okay and now you can hold it
any number of ways uh just to keep his

252
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
any number of ways uh just to keep his
 

253
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,309
any number of ways uh just to keep his
arm his elbow away from his body the

254
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
arm his elbow away from his body the
 

255
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,629
arm his elbow away from his body the
technique I want you to work on is uh

256
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:51,639
technique I want you to work on is uh
 

257
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,670
technique I want you to work on is uh
resist don't let don't let me get that

258
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
resist don't let don't let me get that
 

259
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,909
resist don't let don't let me get that
there you go and you're just going to

260
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:54,919
there you go and you're just going to
 

261
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,629
there you go and you're just going to
crawl it out like this you can wait and

262
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
crawl it out like this you can wait and
 

263
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,909
crawl it out like this you can wait and
keep them in the f

264
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:04,919

 

265
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,230

cycle and then you can get it as he

266
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
cycle and then you can get it as he
 

267
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,110
cycle and then you can get it as he
starts to fatigue okay so we'll work on

268
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
starts to fatigue okay so we'll work on
 

269
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,230
starts to fatigue okay so we'll work on
that arm isolation

270
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240

 

271
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,230

first okay the next arm isolation is any

272
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,240
first okay the next arm isolation is any
 

273
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,110
first okay the next arm isolation is any
anytime he like reaches up or crosses

274
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,120
anytime he like reaches up or crosses
 

275
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,309
anytime he like reaches up or crosses
over his own Center Line if he reaches

276
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
over his own Center Line if he reaches
 

277
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,990
over his own Center Line if he reaches
up I can make him cross over his own

278
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
up I can make him cross over his own
 

279
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,350
up I can make him cross over his own
center line but sometimes they they will

280
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,360
center line but sometimes they they will
 

281
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,510
center line but sometimes they they will
do that okay

282
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:30,520
do that okay
 

283
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,510
do that okay
uh so for example if he's trying to push

284
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:32,520
uh so for example if he's trying to push
 

285
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,710
uh so for example if he's trying to push
to the side right and he just crossed

286
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
to the side right and he just crossed
 

287
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,550
to the side right and he just crossed
over his own Center Line and you'll have

288
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
over his own Center Line and you'll have
 

289
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,950
over his own Center Line and you'll have
this arm isolation here you know my body

290
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
this arm isolation here you know my body
 

291
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,430
this arm isolation here you know my body
weight is on there

292
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
weight is on there
 

293
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,309
weight is on there
okay

294
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
okay
 

295
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,350
okay
um or he pushes straight up right and

296
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
um or he pushes straight up right and
 

297
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,749
um or he pushes straight up right and
then I push it over and then you have

298
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
then I push it over and then you have
 

299
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,230
then I push it over and then you have
this arm isolation here right here okay

300
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,240
this arm isolation here right here okay
 

301
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,510
this arm isolation here right here okay
and you you do you combine that with all

302
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
and you you do you combine that with all
 

303
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,510
and you you do you combine that with all
your Mount securing aspects we've done

304
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
your Mount securing aspects we've done
 

305
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,189
your Mount securing aspects we've done
so far Okay so again either pushed up I

306
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:02,199
so far Okay so again either pushed up I
 

307
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,950
so far Okay so again either pushed up I
yielded and pushed it over and then

308
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:03,960
yielded and pushed it over and then
 

309
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,909
yielded and pushed it over and then
bring my weight down on the elbow do you

310
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
bring my weight down on the elbow do you
 

311
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,830
bring my weight down on the elbow do you
feel that okay or he pushed to the side

312
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
feel that okay or he pushed to the side
 

313
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,149
feel that okay or he pushed to the side
himself right what it doesn't matter and

314
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,159
himself right what it doesn't matter and
 

315
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,909
himself right what it doesn't matter and
you you can do the same thing either

316
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
trapped underneath there again okay so
 

323
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,029
trapped underneath there again okay so
we'll work that arm isolation so you can

324
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,039
we'll work that arm isolation so you can
 

325
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,710
we'll work that arm isolation so you can
combine These Arm isolations so let's

326
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
combine These Arm isolations so let's
 

327
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,710
combine These Arm isolations so let's
say he pushed is I pressed it over and

328
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:31,720
say he pushed is I pressed it over and
 

329
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,230
say he pushed is I pressed it over and
he's going to start getting very

330
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,240
he's going to start getting very
 

331
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,790
he's going to start getting very
desperate on the other hand cuz you he

332
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:35,800
desperate on the other hand cuz you he
 

333
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,709
desperate on the other hand cuz you he
can't push at all on that hand so as he

334
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
can't push at all on that hand so as he
 

335
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,110
can't push at all on that hand so as he
starts to push this is where you can

336
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
starts to push this is where you can
 

337
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,949
starts to push this is where you can
start to work and you can get both arms

338
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:43,959
start to work and you can get both arms
 

339
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,190
start to work and you can get both arms
isolated in here like that okay so one

340
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
isolated in here like that okay so one
 

341
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,150
isolated in here like that okay so one
more time on that move go slow okay so

342
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,160
more time on that move go slow okay so
 

343
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,550
more time on that move go slow okay so
he goes to push I pass come down on it

344
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
he goes to push I pass come down on it
 

345
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,230
he goes to push I pass come down on it
he'll start to feel the helplessness

346
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,240
he'll start to feel the helplessness
 

347
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,030
he'll start to feel the helplessness
there there this arm will start to push

348
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,040
there there this arm will start to push
 

349
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,670
there there this arm will start to push
and that's easy for you now to isolate

350
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
and that's easy for you now to isolate
 

351
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,790
and that's easy for you now to isolate
it and you come in here in this Gable

352
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
it and you come in here in this Gable
 

353
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,829
it and you come in here in this Gable
grip and then you can secure your Mount

354
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:08,839
grip and then you can secure your Mount
 

355
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,829
grip and then you can secure your Mount
any way you want but you have both arms

356
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:10,839
any way you want but you have both arms
 

357
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,110
any way you want but you have both arms
isolated now so combination of the two

358
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,120
isolated now so combination of the two
 

359
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,389
isolated now so combination of the two
arm

360
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:15,399
arm
 

361
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,190
arm
isolations all right so another arm

362
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,200
isolations all right so another arm
 

363
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,630
isolations all right so another arm
isolation double double arm isolation so

364
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,640
isolation double double arm isolation so
 

365
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,750
isolation double double arm isolation so
somehow he he goes so he can either go

366
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:24,760
somehow he he goes so he can either go
 

367
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,630
somehow he he goes so he can either go
here and I can do this cross one here

368
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:27,640
here and I can do this cross one here
 

369
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,670
here and I can do this cross one here
and then of course you have the gift

370
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
and then of course you have the gift
