yielding to it either it's equal
 

175
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,270
yielding to it either it's equal
pressure here and I go around it and

176
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
pressure here and I go around it and
 

177
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,950
pressure here and I go around it and
then I follow the path of least

178
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
then I follow the path of least
 

179
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,390
then I follow the path of least
resistance okay and in the form that

180
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
resistance okay and in the form that
 

181
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,110
resistance okay and in the form that
you're doing at the embryonic level you

182
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
you're doing at the embryonic level you
 

183
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,029
you're doing at the embryonic level you
want to experience the cross as you go

184
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:48,039
want to experience the cross as you go
 

185
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,550
want to experience the cross as you go
towards

186
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:49,560
towards
 

187
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,749
towards
application you still have a iy

188
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
application you still have a iy
 

189
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,270
application you still have a iy
connection but you don't have material

190
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,280
connection but you don't have material
 

191
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,150
connection but you don't have material
contact because IE is not reducible to

192
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
contact because IE is not reducible to
 

193
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,230
contact because IE is not reducible to
materiality okay but to begin we're

194
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,240
materiality okay but to begin we're
 

195
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,749
materiality okay but to begin we're
going to train from the material aspect

196
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
going to train from the material aspect
 

197
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,309
going to train from the material aspect
so you want to make contact and

198
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
so you want to make contact and
 

199
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,990
so you want to make contact and
experience the cross you learn the form

200
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,000
experience the cross you learn the form
 

201
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,710
experience the cross you learn the form
embryonically like this you're not

202
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:11,720
embryonically like this you're not
 

203
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,070
embryonically like this you're not
fighting you're just working a principle

204
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,080

go okay so uh you could tell uh the

570
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:04,760
go okay so uh you could tell uh the
 

571
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,149
go okay so uh you could tell uh the
rotating cross is constant one's working

572
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:07,159
rotating cross is constant one's working
 

573
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,510
rotating cross is constant one's working
through one's working through Tenon if

574
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
through one's working through Tenon if
 

575
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,669
through one's working through Tenon if
you pay attention and then the whole

576
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
you pay attention and then the whole
 

577
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,789
you pay attention and then the whole
fight geometry has to change too one has

578
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:15,799
fight geometry has to change too one has
 

579
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,950
fight geometry has to change too one has
Yang weapon one has a Yin weapon so this

580
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:19,960
Yang weapon one has a Yin weapon so this
 

581
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,430
Yang weapon one has a Yin weapon so this
pattern is is the whole Cosmos okay

582
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
pattern is is the whole Cosmos okay
 

583
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,870
pattern is is the whole Cosmos okay

rolles don't you don't do uh Yin ten Con
on the side that is

590
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
on the side that is
 

591
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,870

that mean I'm I don't have any of the

594
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:42,760
that mean I'm I don't have any of the
 

595
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,390
that mean I'm I don't have any of the
other

596

other
 

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,950
other
aspect yes you do we have a pattern

598
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:47,960
aspect yes you do we have a pattern
 

599
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,230
aspect yes you do we have a pattern
there's clearly a circle on each side of

600
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
there's clearly a circle on each side of
 

601
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,669
there's clearly a circle on each side of
the other element but it is predominant

602
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:52,679
the other element but it is predominant
 

603
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,630
the other element but it is predominant
one okay so as we come along and we're

604
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
one okay so as we come along and we're
 

605
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,310
one okay so as we come along and we're
going boom to see how I go

that in that regard it is very important
 

653
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,789
that in that regard it is very important
that I have the rotating cross because

654
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
that I have the rotating cross because
 

655
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,190
that I have the rotating cross because
it maintains my angle of

656
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
it maintains my angle of
 

657
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,549
it maintains my angle of
deflection through the phase I am on the

658
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
deflection through the phase I am on the
 

659
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,390
deflection through the phase I am on the
line of attack okay so he

660
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
line of attack okay so he
 

661
