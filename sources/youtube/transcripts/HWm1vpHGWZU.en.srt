it hurts so what you do is you go into

76
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:23,799
it hurts so what you do is you go into
 

77
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,149
it hurts so what you do is you go into
self-protection mode because you've

78
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
self-protection mode because you've
 

79
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,429
self-protection mode because you've
signed up to be an iwama you've got to

80
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
signed up to be an iwama you've got to
 

81
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,190
signed up to be an iwama you've got to
put up with it so you go into

82
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
put up with it so you go into
 

83
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,109
put up with it so you go into
self-protection mode so it's easier to

84
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
self-protection mode so it's easier to
 

85
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,429
self-protection mode so it's easier to
take ukemi

86
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
take ukemi
 

87
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,069
take ukemi
than it is to sort of keep going i don't

88
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
than it is to sort of keep going i don't
 

89
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,910
than it is to sort of keep going i don't
want to go because what happens is by

90
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
want to go because what happens is by
 

91
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,630
want to go because what happens is by
you not going or blending

92
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
you not going or blending
 

93
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,109
you not going or blending

they start trying to throw you harder
 

95
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,910
they start trying to throw you harder
so you actually get more injuries

96
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
so you actually get more injuries
 

97
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,830
so you actually get more injuries
so what i want to say today is if you

98
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

99
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,550

go

100
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
go
 

101
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,350
go
at least flow at least you know try and

102
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
at least flow at least you know try and
 

103
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,350
at least flow at least you know try and
blend with it even if you don't want to

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,190
take the the high fall you know
just just try to

108
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200

 

109
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,790

the technique is to gather a little

110
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
the technique is to gather a little
 

111
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,389
the technique is to gather a little
turn it past his body we're not going to

112
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
turn it past his body we're not going to
 

113
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,830
turn it past his body we're not going to
do this i'm just showing you because

114
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
do this i'm just showing you because
 

115
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,190
do this i'm just showing you because
it's the west

116
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200

 

117
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,390

okay

118
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
okay
 

119
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,510
okay
so

120
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
so
 

121
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,990
so
you can't see the power that's coming

122
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
you can't see the power that's coming
 

123
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,270
you can't see the power that's coming
out of me

124
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
out of me
 

125
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,830
out of me
all you can see is a nice ukemi

126
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
all you can see is a nice ukemi
 

127
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,589
all you can see is a nice ukemi
and i know that if nick doesn't want to

128
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
and i know that if nick doesn't want to
 

129
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,869
and i know that if nick doesn't want to
go so this time you don't want to go

130
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
