00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,790
it's the one that I think most people
who study wama weapons know best with

18
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
who study wama weapons know best with
 

19

to start at 1 and work through one um
 

23
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,870
to start at 1 and work through one um
but to me it's full a lot of detailed

24
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:31,880
but to me it's full a lot of detailed
 

25
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,790
but to me it's full a lot of detailed
strange stuff like and not that it's

26
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:33,800
strange stuff like and not that it's
 

27
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,470
strange stuff like and not that it's
really strange it's just tactically

28
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:35,480
really strange it's just tactically
 

29
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,869
really strange it's just tactically
understanding what's happening is

30
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879
understanding what's happening is
 

31
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,229
understanding what's happening is
complex and so we're going to talk about

32
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:39,239
complex and so we're going to talk about
 

33
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,029
complex and so we're going to talk about
that today and to me it's better to save

34
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:41,039
that today and to me it's better to save
 

35
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,069
that today and to me it's better to save
that to the end so it's like people

36
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:43,079
that to the end so it's like people
 

37
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,310
that to the end so it's like people
already have an idea of how to work with

38
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
already have an idea of how to work with
 

39
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,069
already have an idea of how to work with
the Joe and how it tactically comes

40
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
the Joe and how it tactically comes
 

41
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,670
the Joe and how it tactically comes
together before they start working on

42
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
together before they start working on
 

43
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,270
together before they start working on
this Kum Joe that I think is actually

44
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
this Kum Joe that I think is actually
 

45
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,270
this Kum Joe that I think is actually
rather complicated so I'm gonna get Josh

46
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
rather complicated so I'm gonna get Josh
 

47
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,790
rather complicated so I'm gonna get Josh
over here we're going to go to work

48
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:55,800

 

49
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,310

Josh all right so let's talk about my

50
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,320
Josh all right so let's talk about my
 

51
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,709
Josh all right so let's talk about my
ninth Kum Joe um this is like the

52
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:01,719
ninth Kum Joe um this is like the
 

53
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,910
ninth Kum Joe um this is like the
sensei's first Kum Joe this is Kum Joe I

54
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
sensei's first Kum Joe this is Kum Joe I
 

55
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,870
sensei's first Kum Joe this is Kum Joe I
think a lot of people know but is very

56
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
think a lot of people know but is very
 

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,870
think a lot of people know but is very
problematic and tactically complex I

58
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
problematic and tactically complex I
 

59
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,030
problematic and tactically complex I
think there's a bunch of stuff to make

60
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
think there's a bunch of stuff to make
 

61
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,070
think there's a bunch of stuff to make
it make sense you got to understand a

62
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080
it make sense you got to understand a
 

63
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,749
it make sense you got to understand a
lot of things and I think it does make

64
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:14,759
lot of things and I think it does make
 

65
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,429
lot of things and I think it does make
sense and I think it's a good form I

66
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
sense and I think it's a good form I
 

67
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,270
sense and I think it's a good form I
think there's some cool stuff in it but

68
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,280
think there's some cool stuff in it but
 

69
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,390
think there's some cool stuff in it but
it's complex so let's let's hit some of

70
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
it's complex so let's let's hit some of
 

71
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,830
it's complex so let's let's hit some of
that stuff

72
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
that stuff
 

73
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,230
that stuff
today okay so just like from my fourth

00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
last Masashi barai cite the Sensei
 

109
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,510
last Masashi barai cite the Sensei
doesn't really do do it the school I

110
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,520
doesn't really do do it the school I
 

111
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,190
doesn't really do do it the school I
learned it from does do it and I like it

112
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,200
learned it from does do it and I like it
 

113
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,190
learned it from does do it and I like it
because it's a nice additional mhi bu

114
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,200
because it's a nice additional mhi bu
 

115
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,429
because it's a nice additional mhi bu
and you can see mhi BU from a different

116
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
and you can see mhi BU from a different
 

117
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,270
and you can see mhi BU from a different
position but that's basically the way

118
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
position but that's basically the way
 

119
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,510
position but that's basically the way
you'd see the form okay so this form

120
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
you'd see the form okay so this form
 

121
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,150
you'd see the form okay so this form
super complicated when you're in this

122
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
super complicated when you're in this
 

123
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,550
super complicated when you're in this
position it's a harder position in lots

124
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
position it's a harder position in lots
 

125
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,869
position it's a harder position in lots
of ways and I think it might feel okay

126
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
of ways and I think it might feel okay
 

127
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,750
of ways and I think it might feel okay
if you've done it a whole bunch but it

128
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760
if you've done it a whole bunch but it
 

129
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,550
if you've done it a whole bunch but it
is not as good as just grabbing it like

130
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
is not as good as just grabbing it like
 

131
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,509
is not as good as just grabbing it like
this this is an easier way to to grab

132
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:23,519
this this is an easier way to to grab
 

133
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,030
this this is an easier way to to grab
right um but this is a hard way to grab

134
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
right um but this is a hard way to grab
 

135
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,750
right um but this is a hard way to grab
but if I grab this way I'm not really

136
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
but if I grab this way I'm not really
 

137
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,990
but if I grab this way I'm not really
going to be nicely set up for a choku

138
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
going to be nicely set up for a choku
 

139
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,190
going to be nicely set up for a choku
and I could if I stepped to the other

140
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
and I could if I stepped to the other
 

141
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,750
and I could if I stepped to the other
side but so I'm reaching up on top like

142
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
side but so I'm reaching up on top like
 

143
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,550
side but so I'm reaching up on top like
this to deliver a ski so this in my

144
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
this to deliver a ski so this in my
 

145
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,430
this to deliver a ski so this in my
opinion has to be a guy who's kind of

146
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,440
opinion has to be a guy who's kind of
 

147
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,869
opinion has to be a guy who's kind of
comfy with stuff right now another thing

148
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
comfy with stuff right now another thing
 

149
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,190
comfy with stuff right now another thing
that's happening is when Josh is

150
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,200
that's happening is when Josh is
 

151
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,550
that's happening is when Josh is
launching this he's doing a subet ski in

152
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
launching this he's doing a subet ski in
 

153
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,790
launching this he's doing a subet ski in
the form and that's so I can kind of

154
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:45,800
the form and that's so I can kind of
 

155
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,509
the form and that's so I can kind of
time it so he goes subet ski and that's

156
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
time it so he goes subet ski and that's
 

157
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,070
time it so he goes subet ski and that's
the way you see it in the forums but he

158
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
the way you see it in the forums but he
 

159
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,229
the way you see it in the forums but he
could also just be launching a choku ski

160
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
could also just be launching a choku ski
 

161
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,390
could also just be launching a choku ski
so if he's doing that I have to be

162
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
so if he's doing that I have to be
 

163
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,589
so if he's doing that I have to be
really fast in order for him to do that

164
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:56,599
really fast in order for him to do that
 

165
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,910
really fast in order for him to do that
and me hop off to the side and choku ski

166
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,920
and me hop off to the side and choku ski
 

167
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,790
and me hop off to the side and choku ski
him right so this we're talking about a

168
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
him right so this we're talking about a
 

169
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,509
him right so this we're talking about a
person who's faster than the other

170
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
person who's faster than the other
 

171
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,830
person who's faster than the other
person so in this the the she the person

172
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
person so in this the the she the person
 

173
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,630
person so in this the the she the person
who's doing the form has to be faster

174
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
who's doing the form has to be faster
 

175
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,070
who's doing the form has to be faster
right so just have to be faster

176
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
right so just have to be faster
 

177
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,509
right so just have to be faster
otherwise you're not going to get that

178
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
otherwise you're not going to get that
 

179
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,070
otherwise you're not going to get that
off right so in this form we're seeing a

180
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
off right so in this form we're seeing a
 

181
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,830
off right so in this form we're seeing a
good idea which is I should attack an

182
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
good idea which is I should attack an
 

183
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,949
good idea which is I should attack an
attack so that's that's not a bad idea

184
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:17,959
attack so that's that's not a bad idea
 

185
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,229
attack so that's that's not a bad idea
but the problem with that is I just have

186
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,239
but the problem with that is I just have
 

187
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,670
but the problem with that is I just have
to be really fast and especially from

188
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:20,680
to be really fast and especially from
 

189
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,270
to be really fast and especially from
this configuration this is kind of like

190
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,280
this configuration this is kind of like
 

191
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,910
this configuration this is kind of like
a a very specialized kind of thing okay

192
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:24,920
a a very specialized kind of thing okay
 

193
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,509
a a very specialized kind of thing okay
so first of all I think this forms has

194
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:26,519
so first of all I think this forms has
 

195
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,789
so first of all I think this forms has
to be for uh someone who's doing that

196
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
to be for uh someone who's doing that
 

197
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,229
to be for uh someone who's doing that
second part of it is

198
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
second part of it is
 

199
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,190
second part of it is
Josh Midway through has to recognize

200
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
Josh Midway through has to recognize
 

201
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,390
Josh Midway through has to recognize
that I'm attacking stop there and knock

202
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400
that I'm attacking stop there and knock
 

203
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,429
that I'm attacking stop there and knock
this away now this is a guy who's

204
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:37,439
this away now this is a guy who's
 

205
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,149
this away now this is a guy who's
Computing things fast now because it's a

206
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
Computing things fast now because it's a
 

207
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,789
Computing things fast now because it's a
hand action for a foot action I think

208
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
hand action for a foot action I think
 

209
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,190
hand action for a foot action I think
tact technically he can get it off it's

210
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
tact technically he can get it off it's
 

211
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,390
tact technically he can get it off it's
just a lot right so if he were to finish

212
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
just a lot right so if he were to finish
 

213
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,990
just a lot right so if he were to finish
his whole ski and then try to do the

214
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
his whole ski and then try to do the
 

215
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,710
his whole ski and then try to do the
Masashi barai the Masashi baray would be

216
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
Masashi barai the Masashi baray would be
 

217
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,270
Masashi barai the Masashi baray would be
pointless because he would have already

218
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,280
pointless because he would have already
 

219
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,990
pointless because he would have already
got hit right so he has to do it in the

220
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
got hit right so he has to do it in the
 

221
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,670
got hit right so he has to do it in the
middle of my action and in my opinion

222
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
middle of my action and in my opinion
 

223
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,750
middle of my action and in my opinion
teaching students to do this is really

224
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
teaching students to do this is really
 

225
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,350
teaching students to do this is really
hard because actually let's switch rules

226
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
hard because actually let's switch rules
 

227
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,949
hard because actually let's switch rules
real quick because what has to happen is

228
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:05,959
real quick because what has to happen is
 

229
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,270
real quick because what has to happen is
as I come in here I have to not continue

230
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,280
as I come in here I have to not continue
 

231
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,149
as I come in here I have to not continue
forward then I have to Circle boom knock

232
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
forward then I have to Circle boom knock
 

233
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,550
forward then I have to Circle boom knock
it out of the way and then I have to

234
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,560
it out of the way and then I have to
 

235
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,309
it out of the way and then I have to
thrust through right so it would look

236
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,319
thrust through right so it would look
 

237
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,229
thrust through right so it would look
like this right

238
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
like this right
 

239
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,990
like this right
so okay and that's a lot it's a it's a

240
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
so okay and that's a lot it's a it's a
 

241
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,749
so okay and that's a lot it's a it's a
lot to to pull off and could you pull it

242
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
lot to to pull off and could you pull it
 

243
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,069
lot to to pull off and could you pull it
off sure absolutely but it's hard right

244
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
off sure absolutely but it's hard right
 

245
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,670
off sure absolutely but it's hard right
so tactically this is some very fast

246
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,680
so tactically this is some very fast
 

247
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,670
so tactically this is some very fast
decisionmaking and some physically very

248
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680
decisionmaking and some physically very
 

249
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,270
decisionmaking and some physically very
capable people right so this is already

250
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
capable people right so this is already
 

251
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,350
capable people right so this is already
kind of kind of super hard okay the rest

252
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,360
kind of kind of super hard okay the rest
 

253
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,150
kind of kind of super hard okay the rest
of it makes kind of nice sense the the

254
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,160
of it makes kind of nice sense the the
 

255
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,990
of it makes kind of nice sense the the
joden guch is what would happen if we

256
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
joden guch is what would happen if we
 

257
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,790
joden guch is what would happen if we
were at range right which is the

258
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:39,800
were at range right which is the
 

259
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,430
were at range right which is the
opposite of cyes second form so cyes one

260
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
opposite of cyes second form so cyes one
 

261
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,870
opposite of cyes second form so cyes one
and two really kind of have the same

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
and two really kind of have the same
 

263
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,950
and two really kind of have the same
idea of going uh using the defense here

264
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:47,960
idea of going uh using the defense here

territory here he comes in I defend here

292
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
territory here he comes in I defend here

territory here he comes in I defend here
I'm at distance so I just go ahead and

294
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm at distance so I just go ahead and
 

295
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,150
I'm at distance so I just go ahead and
take the distance he steps back and

296
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
take the distance he steps back and
 

297
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,230

defends now what's nice here let's

298
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
defends now what's nice here let's
 

299
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,550
defends now what's nice here let's
rewind that a little bit so Josh could

300
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
rewind that a little bit so Josh could
 

301
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,670
rewind that a little bit so Josh could
also do other options so if he was in

302
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
also do other options so if he was in
 

303
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,670
also do other options so if he was in
range and I was going forward at all he

304
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
range and I was going forward at all he
 

305
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,350
range and I was going forward at all he
could just do first form answer and stab

306
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
could just do first form answer and stab
 

307
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,909
could just do first form answer and stab
me right here Bo right so that's good

308
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
me right here Bo right so that's good
 

309
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,070
me right here Bo right so that's good
okay if he thought he couldn't because

310
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
okay if he thought he couldn't because
 

311
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,110
okay if he thought he couldn't because
I'm backing up he could use second form

312
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,120
