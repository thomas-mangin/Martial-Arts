1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,510

this isn't for me a technique

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520

 

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,650

for women because if I do this and now

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:09,660
for women because if I do this and now
 

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,150
for women because if I do this and now
do this

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,160
do this
 

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,089
do this
the technique has to rub up

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:14,099
the technique has to rub up
 

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,330
the technique has to rub up
through my breastbone all right and

10
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:17,340
through my breastbone all right and
 

11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,510
through my breastbone all right and

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
I've got a chance now when you drop this
 

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,849
I've got a chance now when you drop this
elbow and countering me and

20
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:31,859
elbow and countering me and

29
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,650
saying for women you know if you take it
off your breastbone

30
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:45,660
off your breastbone
 

31
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,750
off your breastbone
now she started it I can feel it getting

32
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
now she started it I can feel it getting
 

33
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,270
now she started it I can feel it getting
strong against me so I'm gonna get even

34
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,280
strong against me so I'm gonna get even
 

35
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,770
strong against me so I'm gonna get even
stronger

36
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:51,780
stronger
 

37
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,069
stronger
right so so I'm afraid

38
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
right so so I'm afraid
 

39
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,010
right so so I'm afraid
to me it's not like

40
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,020
to me it's not like
 

41
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,590
to me it's not like
performance technique

42
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
performance technique
 

43
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,990
performance technique
because it needs to be there so she

44
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000
because it needs to be there so she
 

45
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,090
because it needs to be there so she
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't

46
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,100
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't
 

47
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,370
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't
feel much strength she feels it near

48
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:07,380
feel much strength she feels it near
 

49
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,429
feel much strength she feels it near
when I start returning

50
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,439
when I start returning
 

51
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,730
when I start returning
see but here

52
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:13,740
see but here
 

53
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,010

00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,020
see I can turn as much of a light as you
 

55
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,510
see I can turn as much of a light as you
go yeah or I'm going to punch in the

56
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
go yeah or I'm going to punch in the
 

57
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,550

face
all right so

60
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
all right so
 

61
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,130
all right so
because I'm old I'm not sure about the

62
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,140
because I'm old I'm not sure about the
 

63
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,890
because I'm old I'm not sure about the
gender neutral and all the other

64
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:26,900
gender neutral and all the other
 

65
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,450
gender neutral and all the other
technology words that we have to use now

66
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,460
technology words that we have to use now
 

67
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,249
technology words that we have to use now
I'm just saying it's not a great

68
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,259
I'm just saying it's not a great
 

69
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,469
I'm just saying it's not a great
technique for ladies because you've got

70
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
technique for ladies because you've got
 

71
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,850
technique for ladies because you've got
to use strength you know if you're

72
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:34,860

looking after your own body you've got
to think

76
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
to think
 

77
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,569
to think
so this technique has to go up the bread

78
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:41,579
so this technique has to go up the bread
 

79
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,609
so this technique has to go up the bread
bottom so that you don't move straight

80
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:43,619
bottom so that you don't move straight
 

81
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,649
bottom so that you don't move straight
like those all about not using strength

82
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:45,659
like those all about not using strength
 

83
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,410
like those all about not using strength
so I was reading about those scents here

84
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,420
so I was reading about those scents here
 

85
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,969
so I was reading about those scents here
when you've got a 70 there's a lot of

86
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:49,979
when you've got a 70 there's a lot of
 

87
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,190
when you've got a 70 there's a lot of
techniques he didn't do

88
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,200
techniques he didn't do
 

89
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,190
techniques he didn't do
issue

90
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
issue
 

91
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,530
issue
but if we do this one

92
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540
but if we do this one
 

93
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,649
but if we do this one
now I think our same here

94
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
now I think our same here
 

95
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,310
now I think our same here
even that doesn't look like a thank you

96
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
even that doesn't look like a thank you
 

97
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,789
even that doesn't look like a thank you
because I've got this arm up that's it

98
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
because I've got this arm up that's it
 

99
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,770
because I've got this arm up that's it
so that's the main thing so let's just

100
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:11,780
so that's the main thing so let's just
 

101
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,430
so that's the main thing so let's just
I'm going to get out all the way

102
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440

 

103
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,250

just lock her here but this hair and

104
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,260
just lock her here but this hair and
 

105
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,470
just lock her here but this hair and
watched this home I'm going to take hold

106
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,480
watched this home I'm going to take hold
 

107
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,670
watched this home I'm going to take hold
of the rest

108
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
of the rest
 

109
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,410
of the rest
and then when it gets to about there see

110
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,420
and then when it gets to about there see
 

111
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,750
and then when it gets to about there see
this hand now is coming to me so that

112
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
this hand now is coming to me so that
 

113
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,430
this hand now is coming to me so that
she doesn't get away from me now

114
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440

 

115
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,010

this can be done without using strength

116
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,020
this can be done without using strength
 

117
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:44,809
this can be done without using strength
and you you find the mechanics

118
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:44,819

 

119
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,210

very simple as you'll see when try and

120
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220
very simple as you'll see when try and
 

121
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,459
very simple as you'll see when try and
do it
