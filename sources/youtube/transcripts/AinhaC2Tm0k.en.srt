the front side for example
and then uh you're very slow out of the

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:05,580
and then uh you're very slow out of the
 

39
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,350
and then uh you're very slow out of the

00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
do you see that
 

51
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,330
do you see that
I mean you could you could deviate

52
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,340
I mean you could you could deviate
 

53
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,130
I mean you could you could deviate
somewhat with your head and shoulders

somewhat with your head and shoulders
 

55
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,410
somewhat with your head and shoulders
but you're still on the line of attack

but you're still on the line of attack
 

57
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,590
but you're still on the line of attack
do you get it so your angle deviation

58
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
do you get it so your angle deviation
 

59
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,569
do you get it so your angle deviation
should always have your entire body

60
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:35,579
should always have your entire body
 

61
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,870
should always have your entire body
clear the line of attack and

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:51,659
a lot of those eight angles are just not
 

71
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,990
a lot of those eight angles are just not
available to you very quickly

the tension across my inner knee do you

148
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
the tension across my inner knee do you
 

149
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,070
the tension across my inner knee do you
see or I can feel the tension this puts

150

in my lower back
 

153
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,770
in my lower back
and anytime you have tension you have to

154
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:39,780
and anytime you have tension you have to
 

155
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,869
and anytime you have tension you have to
first uh

00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
super tense right and you get really
 

169
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,089
super tense right and you get really
good at shooting you realize that the

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
from a concentric point of view and
 

337
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,170
from a concentric point of view and
that's what we want to get to right now

338
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,180
that's what we want to get to right now
 

339
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,510
that's what we want to get to right now
okay so the first thing that I would say

340
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
okay so the first thing that I would say
 

341
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,850
okay so the first thing that I would say
remember when I talk about an a

342
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:55,860
remember when I talk about an a
 

343
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,390
remember when I talk about an a
concentric epistemy the analogy for

344
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,400
concentric epistemy the analogy for
 

345
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,730
concentric epistemy the analogy for
someone who doesn't know what concentric

346
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:01,740
someone who doesn't know what concentric
 

347
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,510
someone who doesn't know what concentric
means let alone a concentric epistemy is

348
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
means let alone a concentric epistemy is
 

349
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,029
means let alone a concentric epistemy is
think of Russian stacking dolls okay

350
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,039
think of Russian stacking dolls okay
 

351
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,249
think of Russian stacking dolls okay
little tiny

352
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:10,259
little tiny
 

353
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,529
little tiny
same image on the inside on the inside

354
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:12,539
same image on the inside on the inside
 

355
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,370
same image on the inside on the inside
on the inside on the inside okay

356
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,380
on the inside on the inside okay
 

357
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,070
on the inside on the inside okay
so you you would have let's say

358
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080

 

359
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,070

an outside

360
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,080
an outside
 

361
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,469
an outside
or an external

362
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
or an external
 

363
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,490
or an external
and then you have an inside and and then

364
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,500
and then you have an inside and and then
 

365
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,029
and then you have an inside and and then
or an internal got it

366
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
or an internal got it
 

367
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,589
or an internal got it
and what happens on the outside

368
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599

 

369
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,170

is consentive with what's happening on

370
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,180
is consentive with what's happening on
 

371
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,730
is consentive with what's happening on
the inside

372
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:43,740
the inside
 

373
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,030
the inside
okay and so you can't do something on

374
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
okay and so you can't do something on
 

375
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,790
okay and so you can't do something on
the outside that contradicts what's

376
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
the outside that contradicts what's
 

377
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,610
the outside that contradicts what's
going on on the inside

378
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:52,620
going on on the inside
 

379
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,190
going on on the inside
or everything falls apart okay so first

380
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
or everything falls apart okay so first
 

381
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,290
or everything falls apart okay so first
let's talk about what's going on on the

382
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,300
let's talk about what's going on on the
 

383
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,009
let's talk about what's going on on the
inside

384
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:58,019
inside
 

385
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,230
inside
okay

386
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
okay
 

387
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,490
okay
so

388
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:01,500
so
 

389
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,570
so
you're going to

390
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580

 

391
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,889

take the young aspect

392
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899

 

393
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,590

it's difficult for me today to say young

394
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:12,600
it's difficult for me today to say young
 

395
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,889
it's difficult for me today to say young
energy because when I say energy

396
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:15,899
energy because when I say energy
 

397
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,550
energy because when I say energy
you think like microwave or cell phone

398
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,560
you think like microwave or cell phone
 

399
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,070
you think like microwave or cell phone
or something I imagine those have young

400
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
or something I imagine those have young
 

401
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,530
or something I imagine those have young
aspects to them I'm more comfortable

402
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:24,540
aspects to them I'm more comfortable
 

403
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,290
aspects to them I'm more comfortable
with the young aspect and if you if you

404
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
with the young aspect and if you if you
 

405
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,870
with the young aspect and if you if you
want to identify it in inertia or

406
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
want to identify it in inertia or
 

407
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,870
want to identify it in inertia or
momentum or mass or something like okay

408
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
momentum or mass or something like okay
 

409
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,790
momentum or mass or something like okay
fine do you get it but it would be all

410
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
fine do you get it but it would be all
 

411
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,210
fine do you get it but it would be all
of those things okay plus gravity and

412
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
of those things okay plus gravity and
 

413
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,630
of those things okay plus gravity and
plus friction on the ground you see that

414
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:41,640
plus friction on the ground you see that
 

415
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,410
plus friction on the ground you see that
so your goal internals that we're going

416
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:45,420
so your goal internals that we're going
 

417
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,750
so your goal internals that we're going
to look at this and that's all we're

418
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
to look at this and that's all we're
 

419
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,550
to look at this and that's all we're
looking at right now

420
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:49,560
looking at right now
 

421
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,670
looking at right now
okay

422
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:52,680

 

423
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,650

is to take the young aspect

424
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:57,660

 

425
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,650

and internalize it

426
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:00,660
and internalize it
 

427
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,870
and internalize it
so for example if we have UK

428
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:05,880

 

429
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,230

and nuke is going to push on you

430
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
and nuke is going to push on you
 

431
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,410
and nuke is going to push on you
are you with me okay so this push that

432
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:12,420
are you with me okay so this push that
 

433
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,110
are you with me okay so this push that
UK is doing uh

434
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
UK is doing uh
 

435
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,829
UK is doing uh
finish this for me what do we call it

436
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
finish this for me what do we call it
 

437
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,150
finish this for me what do we call it
spinal displacement okay

438
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,160

 

439
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,990

so spinal displacement is the tactic

440
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000

 

441
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,930

but spinal displacement is a young

442
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:32,940
but spinal displacement is a young
 

443
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,250
but spinal displacement is a young
tactic

444
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,260
tactic
 

445
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,570
tactic
okay all of your kihon waza in Aikido

446
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:40,580

 

447
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,790

assume spinal displacement

448
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:43,800
assume spinal displacement
 

449
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,949
assume spinal displacement
which tells you you guys know because

450
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:45,959
which tells you you guys know because
 

451
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,949
which tells you you guys know because
you know Jabs and you know all fakes and

452
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
you know Jabs and you know all fakes and
 

453
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,470
you know Jabs and you know all fakes and
feigns and you know measuring strikes

454
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480
feigns and you know measuring strikes
 

455
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,470
feigns and you know measuring strikes
and all kinds of other tactics that

456
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
and all kinds of other tactics that
 

457
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,290
and all kinds of other tactics that
don't involve spinal displacement do you

458
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,300
don't involve spinal displacement do you
 

459
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,449
don't involve spinal displacement do you
get it and so you know if you try to do

460
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:01,459
get it and so you know if you try to do
 

461
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,750
get it and so you know if you try to do
inimage

462
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:04,760

 

463
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,889

on a jab

464
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:06,899
on a jab
 

465
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,170
on a jab
and it's not going to work do you see

466
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,180
and it's not going to work do you see
 

467
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,389
and it's not going to work do you see
there's a lot of Aikido people out there

468
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:11,399
there's a lot of Aikido people out there
 

469
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,329
there's a lot of Aikido people out there
though that are trying to do kihonawaza

470
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:14,339
though that are trying to do kihonawaza
 

471
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,949
though that are trying to do kihonawaza
for a jab

472
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
for a jab
 

473
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,550
for a jab
why because they have no other solution

474
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:19,560
why because they have no other solution
 

475
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,590
why because they have no other solution
to it all they know is kilon waza

476
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600

 

477
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,170

it's no coincidence that they don't know

478
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:27,180
it's no coincidence that they don't know
 

479
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,790
it's no coincidence that they don't know
jab Cross or jab up or cat do you see or

because if they did they would learn

484
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:35,459
because if they did they would learn
 

485
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,750
because if they did they would learn
real quick you can't do quotes again

486
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:40,760

 

487
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,850

do you understand okay

488
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:43,860
do you understand okay
 

489
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,030
do you understand okay
but yokio and Wasa assumes spinal

490
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
but yokio and Wasa assumes spinal
 

491
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,210
but yokio and Wasa assumes spinal
displacement spinal displacement is

492
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,220
displacement spinal displacement is
 

493
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,550
displacement spinal displacement is
a young aspect

494
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
a young aspect
 

495
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,670
a young aspect
and what you're supposed to do here's

496
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
and what you're supposed to do here's
 

497
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,050
and what you're supposed to do here's
your little body

498
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,060

 

499
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,670

is you internalize the young aspect

500
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
is you internalize the young aspect
 

501
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,250
is you internalize the young aspect
now you can do that because you're a

502
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
now you can do that because you're a
 

503
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,410
now you can do that because you're a
human being you're like why I don't know

504
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,420
human being you're like why I don't know
 

505
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,410
human being you're like why I don't know
why it's just what human beings can do

506
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,420
why it's just what human beings can do
 

507
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,810
why it's just what human beings can do
okay

508
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:17,820
okay
 

509
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,870
okay
you internalize the young aspect and

510
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
you internalize the young aspect and
 

511
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,210
you internalize the young aspect and
then you will Vector it down so it'll go

512
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,220
then you will Vector it down so it'll go
 

513
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,370
then you will Vector it down so it'll go
in your body

514
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,380
in your body
 

515
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,569
in your body
and it'll and then you Vector it down

516
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:29,579
and it'll and then you Vector it down
 

517
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,889
and it'll and then you Vector it down
okay and when it vectors down it's going

518
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:33,899
okay and when it vectors down it's going
 

519
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,050
okay and when it vectors down it's going
to hit the Earth and the Earth is going

520
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,060
to hit the Earth and the Earth is going
 

521
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,930
to hit the Earth and the Earth is going
to bounce it up

522
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:38,940
to bounce it up
 

523
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,569
to bounce it up
and those two forces are going to

524
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:41,579
and those two forces are going to
 

525
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,230
and those two forces are going to
generate your lower tonden

526
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,240
generate your lower tonden
 

527
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,290
generate your lower tonden
so when you look at kilo noaza and Uka

528
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,300
so when you look at kilo noaza and Uka
 

529
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,509
so when you look at kilo noaza and Uka
is prescribed to do spinal displacement

530
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519

 

531
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,050

you ground Vector do you see you send

532
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,060
you ground Vector do you see you send
 

533
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,970
you ground Vector do you see you send
that energy down

534
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:58,980
that energy down
 

535
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,850
that energy down
it'll bounce back up and now the two of

536
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:01,860
it'll bounce back up and now the two of
 

537
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,190
it'll bounce back up and now the two of
you will have your lower tonden Fields

538
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,200
you will have your lower tonden Fields
 

539
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,690
you will have your lower tonden Fields
generated and you should feel that okay

540
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:08,700
generated and you should feel that okay
 

541
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,810
generated and you should feel that okay
when those two fields are simultaneously

542
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:11,820
when those two fields are simultaneously
 

543
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,710
when those two fields are simultaneously
generated by this internal process that

544
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:15,720
generated by this internal process that
 

545
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,210
generated by this internal process that
is kazushi

546
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,220
is kazushi
 

547
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,210
is kazushi
wherever I move as Naga my time dead

548
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,220
wherever I move as Naga my time dead
 

549
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,470
wherever I move as Naga my time dead
your time then will move okay even if I

550
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
your time then will move okay even if I
 

551
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,629
your time then will move okay even if I
want to hold it still

552
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
want to hold it still
 

553
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,850
want to hold it still
and you now want to move it you will

554
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:28,860
and you now want to move it you will
 

555
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,009
and you now want to move it you will
lose your balance do you see so that is

556
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:31,019
lose your balance do you see so that is
 

557
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,490
lose your balance do you see so that is
the seed of kazushi

558
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:34,500

 

559
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,790

all right

560
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:37,800

 

561
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,730

what you've done here is you have a

562
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:40,740
what you've done here is you have a
 

563
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,490
what you've done here is you have a
young aspect and then you have a Yin

564
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:43,500
young aspect and then you have a Yin
 

565
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,250
young aspect and then you have a Yin
aspect you see and together those meet

566
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,260
aspect you see and together those meet
 

567
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,009
aspect you see and together those meet
your time your lower tandem field they

568
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:49,019
your time your lower tandem field they
 

569
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,170
your time your lower tandem field they
make it they generate it

570
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,180
make it they generate it
 

571
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,410
make it they generate it
you do not have a Tom Den

572
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
you do not have a Tom Den
 

573
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,590
you do not have a Tom Den
like most Aikido people think it's two

574
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
like most Aikido people think it's two
 

575
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,449
like most Aikido people think it's two
inches below your navel and two inches

576
00:13:59,449 --> 00:13:59,459
inches below your navel and two inches
 

577
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,750
inches below your navel and two inches
in from your skin you know you don't you

578
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:02,760
in from your skin you know you don't you
 

579
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,449
in from your skin you know you don't you
don't it's not an anatomical place

580
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:05,459
don't it's not an anatomical place
 

581
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,170
don't it's not an anatomical place
you see it's manifested only at this

582
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,180
you see it's manifested only at this
 

583
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,670
you see it's manifested only at this
time

584
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
time
 

585
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,610
time
do you understand that so one I would

586
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,620
do you understand that so one I would
 

587
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,850
do you understand that so one I would
need the skill in order to manifest it

588
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:16,860
need the skill in order to manifest it
 

589
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,030
need the skill in order to manifest it
in order to internalize young energy but

590
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,040
in order to internalize young energy but
 

591
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,910
in order to internalize young energy but
two I would have to be wanting to do it

592
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:22,920
two I would have to be wanting to do it
 

593
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,470
two I would have to be wanting to do it
at that time

594
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
at that time
 

595
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,810
at that time
okay otherwise it just it goes away the

596
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:26,820
okay otherwise it just it goes away the
 

597
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,470
okay otherwise it just it goes away the
two energies go away okay

598
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
two energies go away okay
 

599
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,810
two energies go away okay
all right

600
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:32,820
all right
 

601
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,629
all right
what you're supposed to do

602
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
what you're supposed to do
 

603
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,790
what you're supposed to do
with this field is spiral rotated

604
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
with this field is spiral rotated
 

605
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,530
with this field is spiral rotated
okay

606
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:42,540
okay
 

607
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,810
okay
so let me clean this up a little bit

608
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:47,820

 

609
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:54,949

here's your here's your dude

610
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959

 

611
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,009

here's his legs

612
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:58,019
here's his legs
 

613
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,009
here's his legs
okay and then that field shows up in

614
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:01,019
okay and then that field shows up in
 

615
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,990
okay and then that field shows up in
here

616
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,000
here
 

617
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,230
here
and it's young energy going down and

618
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
and it's young energy going down and
 

619
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,990
and it's young energy going down and
your energy coming up

620
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
your energy coming up
 

621
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,410
your energy coming up
or really young energy transitioning do

622
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:12,420
or really young energy transitioning do
 

623
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,230
or really young energy transitioning do
you see into yin and Yin energy

624
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,240
you see into yin and Yin energy
 

625
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,590
you see into yin and Yin energy
transitioning into young okay

626
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,600
transitioning into young okay
 

627
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,170
transitioning into young okay
what you're supposed to do is spiral

628
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,180
what you're supposed to do is spiral
 

629
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,910
what you're supposed to do is spiral
rotate this thing

630
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
rotate this thing
 

631
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,689
rotate this thing
so I if this is a poor example because

632
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:26,699
so I if this is a poor example because
 

633
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,530
so I if this is a poor example because
your mind is gonna go it's like a ball

634
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:30,540
your mind is gonna go it's like a ball
 

635
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,530
your mind is gonna go it's like a ball
it's it's not a ball

636
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:33,540
it's it's not a ball
 

637
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,069
it's it's not a ball
it's not breath do you see like there's

638
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:37,079
it's not breath do you see like there's
 

639
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,090
it's not breath do you see like there's
air in here it's not air in there

640
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,100
air in here it's not air in there
 

641
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,509
air in here it's not air in there
um that's why I would your Energy's kind

642
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:44,519
um that's why I would your Energy's kind
 

643
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,310
um that's why I would your Energy's kind
of pushing it do you know because you're

644
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
of pushing it do you know because you're
 

645
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,650
of pushing it do you know because you're
gonna picture radio waves or something

646
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:48,660
gonna picture radio waves or something
 

647
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,990
gonna picture radio waves or something
do you understand do you get it

648
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,000
do you understand do you get it
 

649
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,930
do you understand do you get it
so but imagine

650
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:53,940
so but imagine
 

651
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,790
so but imagine
you had

652
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:55,800
you had
 

653
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,470
you had
you had energy going up do you see like

654
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
you had energy going up do you see like
 

655
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,210
you had energy going up do you see like
a line

656
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,220
a line
 

657
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,850
a line
got it

658
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:04,860
got it
 

659
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,310
got it
and what you're going to do is imagine

660
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,320
and what you're going to do is imagine
 

661
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,490
and what you're going to do is imagine
that at that point on this tandem field

662
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,500
that at that point on this tandem field
 

663
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,129
that at that point on this tandem field
was like right here

664
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:13,139
was like right here
 

665
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,110
was like right here
right here

666
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
right here
 

667
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,689
right here
okay but it's not a point remember I

668
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:17,699
okay but it's not a point remember I
 

669
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,550
okay but it's not a point remember I
already told you that it's a field

670
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:19,560
already told you that it's a field
 

671
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,069
already told you that it's a field
but we use this point for reference so

672
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
but we use this point for reference so
 

673
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,670
but we use this point for reference so
you can see what spiral rotation is okay

674
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
you can see what spiral rotation is okay
 

675
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,490
you can see what spiral rotation is okay
what you're going to do is you can

676
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:28,500
what you're going to do is you can
 

677
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,370
what you're going to do is you can
either go uh left

678
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,380
either go uh left
 

679
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,490
either go uh left
or you can go right doesn't matter okay

680
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:34,500
or you can go right doesn't matter okay
 

681
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,769
or you can go right doesn't matter okay
or you could go down or you could go up

682
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:36,779
or you could go down or you could go up
 

683
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,449
or you could go down or you could go up
initially

684
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:38,459
initially
 

685
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,069
initially
but the rule is that if you go to the

686
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,079
but the rule is that if you go to the
 

687
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,269
but the rule is that if you go to the
right

688
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:44,279
right
 

689
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,030
right
you can't come back left

690
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
you can't come back left
 

691
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,829
you can't come back left
do you get it so you and you also

692
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
do you get it so you and you also
 

693
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,389
do you get it so you and you also
have to go all the way around

694
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399

 

695
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,550

so what is that Hemisphere and how many

696
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
so what is that Hemisphere and how many
 

697
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,910
so what is that Hemisphere and how many
degrees is that 180 you have to go 180

698
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
degrees is that 180 you have to go 180
 

699
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,630
degrees is that 180 you have to go 180
okay and add 180

700
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:05,640
okay and add 180
 

701
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,210
okay and add 180
you can't go all the way around you have

702
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:08,220
you can't go all the way around you have
 

703
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,150
you can't go all the way around you have
to go up or down

704
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,160
to go up or down
 

705
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,490
to go up or down
okay so let's say I want to go right

706
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:16,500
okay so let's say I want to go right
 

707
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,090
okay so let's say I want to go right
then I have to go down you see and now I

708
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,100
then I have to go down you see and now I
 

709
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,010
then I have to go down you see and now I
did the 180 again

710
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,020
did the 180 again
 

711
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,630
did the 180 again
and now can I can I continue no I can't

712
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
and now can I can I continue no I can't
 

713
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,110
and now can I can I continue no I can't
you see and I can't reverse it I now

714
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,120
you see and I can't reverse it I now
 

715
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,570
you see and I can't reverse it I now
have to take the other one do you see

716
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:32,580
have to take the other one do you see
 

717
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,890
have to take the other one do you see
that and then do the last one

718
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:36,900
that and then do the last one
 

719
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,510
that and then do the last one
okay

720
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:38,520
okay
 

721
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,549
okay
if you make this across

722
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:43,559

 

723
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,510

and you give these yin yang values what

724
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
and you give these yin yang values what
 

725
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,510
and you give these yin yang values what
you're doing is is spinning it rotating

726
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:50,520
you're doing is is spinning it rotating
 

727
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,590
you're doing is is spinning it rotating
it

728
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
it
 

729
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,250
it
and the cosmology would hold

730
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,260
and the cosmology would hold
 

731
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,150
and the cosmology would hold
that yin and yon now disappear because

732
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,160
that yin and yon now disappear because
 

733
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,909
that yin and yon now disappear because
they can never become oppositional to

734
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
they can never become oppositional to
 

735
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,110
they can never become oppositional to
each other

736
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
each other
 

737
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,630
each other
and they reconcile each other

738
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
and they reconcile each other
 

739
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,370
and they reconcile each other
do you understand

740
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:07,380
do you understand
 

741
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,210
do you understand
and this is now something else happens

742
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,220
and this is now something else happens
 

743
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,450
and this is now something else happens
when yin and yang cannot be oppositional

744
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,460
when yin and yang cannot be oppositional
 

745
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,510
when yin and yang cannot be oppositional
to each other they can they reconcile

746
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
to each other they can they reconcile
 

747
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,029
to each other they can they reconcile
each other and now yin and yang no

748
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:20,039
each other and now yin and yang no
 

749
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,890
each other and now yin and yang no
longer exists

750
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:21,900
longer exists
 

751
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,169
longer exists
do you get get that it's the

752
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:24,179
do you get get that it's the
 

753
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,230
do you get get that it's the
oppositional Theory okay now that yin

754
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,240
oppositional Theory okay now that yin
 

755
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,330
oppositional Theory okay now that yin
and yang no longer exists what exists

756
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,340
and yang no longer exists what exists
 

757
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,409
and yang no longer exists what exists
doubt

758
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:30,419
doubt
 

759
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,289
doubt
cow exist okay

760
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:33,299
cow exist okay
 

761
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,310
cow exist okay
so if my if my Tom Dan is doing a spiral

762
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
so if my if my Tom Dan is doing a spiral
 

763
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,049
so if my if my Tom Dan is doing a spiral
rotation on the inside of my body

764
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,059

 

765
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,930

I must do a spiral rotation on the

766
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:44,940
I must do a spiral rotation on the
 

767
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,029
I must do a spiral rotation on the
outside of my body

768
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
outside of my body
 

769
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,230
outside of my body
okay another words I cannot move

770
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,240
okay another words I cannot move
 

771
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,570
okay another words I cannot move
straight across the map

772
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:53,580
straight across the map
 

773
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,690
straight across the map
because my tandem would do that you know

774
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:56,700
because my tandem would do that you know
 

775
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,210
because my tandem would do that you know
my tongue then would do that I can't do

776
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,220
my tongue then would do that I can't do
 

777
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,450
my tongue then would do that I can't do
that I have to do this do you get it are

778
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:02,460
that I have to do this do you get it are
 

779
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,409
that I have to do this do you get it are
you with me okay because if I do that

780
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:06,419
you with me okay because if I do that
 

781
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,650
you with me okay because if I do that
you're going to have either Yin or young

782
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:09,660
you're going to have either Yin or young
 

783
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,710
you're going to have either Yin or young
get it okay

784
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
get it okay
 

785
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,610
get it okay
so my outers my outer shape must also

786
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:16,620
so my outers my outer shape must also
 

787
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,830
so my outers my outer shape must also
spiral rotate my kihonawaza must adopt a

788
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
spiral rotate my kihonawaza must adopt a
 

789
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,090
spiral rotate my kihonawaza must adopt a
spiral rotating architecture

790
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,100
spiral rotating architecture
 

791
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,470
spiral rotating architecture
okay

792
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,480
okay
 

793
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,930
okay
all right there's something else to note

794
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:29,940
all right there's something else to note
 

795
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,590
all right there's something else to note
here

796
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600

 

797
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,150

and that's what makes the outside

798
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,160
and that's what makes the outside
 

799
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,510
and that's what makes the outside
concentric to the inside the inside at

800
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
concentric to the inside the inside at
 

801
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,090
concentric to the inside the inside at
the lower Tom Dan is forward rotating

802
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,100
the lower Tom Dan is forward rotating
 

803
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,330
the lower Tom Dan is forward rotating
outside my keyhorn architecture must

804
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,340
outside my keyhorn architecture must
 

805
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,130
outside my keyhorn architecture must
spiral rotate

806
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,140
spiral rotate
 

807
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,310
spiral rotate
okay

808
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320

 

809
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,830

there's something else here and this

810
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
there's something else here and this
 

811
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,890
there's something else here and this
gives us the foot the foot problem okay

812
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:57,900

 

813
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,890

the foot problem

814
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:00,900

 

815
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,330

first when you have your feet like this

816
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,340
first when you have your feet like this
 

817
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,850
first when you have your feet like this
you will not be able to turn the front

818
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:07,860
you will not be able to turn the front
 

819
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,010
you will not be able to turn the front
hip into the final either in or down if

820
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,020
hip into the final either in or down if
 

821
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,830
hip into the final either in or down if
you're going for the front inward

822
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:14,840
you're going for the front inward
 

823
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,490
you're going for the front inward
kazushi or out or up

824
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:19,500
kazushi or out or up
 

825
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,930
kazushi or out or up
okay you won't be able to do it

826
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:23,940

 

827
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:31,789

but secondarily

828
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:31,799

 

829
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,930

aside from all that biomechanical stuff

830
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,940
aside from all that biomechanical stuff
 

831
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,070
aside from all that biomechanical stuff
that internalization of yawn

832
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
that internalization of yawn
 

833
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,970
that internalization of yawn
has to land on my midfoot

834
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:43,980
has to land on my midfoot
 

835
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,330
has to land on my midfoot
the midfoot is where it bounces back off

836
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:47,340
the midfoot is where it bounces back off
 

837
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,070
the midfoot is where it bounces back off
the ground

838
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,080
the ground
 

839
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,549
the ground
okay now why I don't know why it just

840
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
okay now why I don't know why it just
 

841
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,430
okay now why I don't know why it just
that's where it is okay you you can't

842
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
that's where it is okay you you can't
 

843
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,070
that's where it is okay you you can't
cry about the nature of the universe it

844
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
cry about the nature of the universe it
 

845
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,110
cry about the nature of the universe it
just did why is the sun coming up

846
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,120
just did why is the sun coming up
 

847
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,529
just did why is the sun coming up
tomorrow you're going to tell me how you

848
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:03,539
tomorrow you're going to tell me how you
 

849
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,710
tomorrow you're going to tell me how you
can't tell me why do you get that

850
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
can't tell me why do you get that
 

851
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,390
can't tell me why do you get that
okay

852
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
okay
 

853
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,150
okay
so same thing it has to be the midfoot

854
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,160
so same thing it has to be the midfoot
 

855
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,150
so same thing it has to be the midfoot
and when you adopt this posture

856
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
and when you adopt this posture
 

857
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,630
and when you adopt this posture
you will not be able to

858
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
you will not be able to
 

859
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,010
you will not be able to
internalize the young aspect send it

860
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,020
internalize the young aspect send it
 

861
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,049
internalize the young aspect send it
down to the midfoot you're going to send

862
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,059
down to the midfoot you're going to send
 

863
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,590
down to the midfoot you're going to send
it down to the heel or to the arch it's

864
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,600
it down to the heel or to the arch it's
 

865
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,090
it down to the heel or to the arch it's
too far back

866
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,100
too far back
 

867
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,430
too far back
okay it won't bounce back up

868
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,440
okay it won't bounce back up
 

869
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,990
okay it won't bounce back up
which is why

870
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
which is why
 

871
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,830
which is why
most people that adopt that are in a

872
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
most people that adopt that are in a
 

873
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,230
most people that adopt that are in a
bracing angle with the back leg to hold

874
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
bracing angle with the back leg to hold
 

875
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,630
bracing angle with the back leg to hold
positional integrity

876
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
positional integrity
 

877
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,710
positional integrity
versus ground vectoring I can take away

878
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
versus ground vectoring I can take away
 

879
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,830
versus ground vectoring I can take away
one leg and you still can't push me over

880
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
one leg and you still can't push me over
 

881
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,610
one leg and you still can't push me over
all those demonstrations okay

882
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:49,620
all those demonstrations okay
 

883
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,850
all those demonstrations okay
the other thing is

884
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:51,860
the other thing is
 

885
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,970
the other thing is
your your curvature

886
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:55,980
your your curvature
 

887
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,029
your your curvature
that you have in your body as this is

888
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
that you have in your body as this is
 

889
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,610
that you have in your body as this is
curving in

890
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:01,620
curving in
 

891
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,590
curving in
is done

892
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
is done
 

893
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,690
is done
with the qua

894
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:05,700
with the qua
 

895
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,990
with the qua
so the quad remember for simplicity's

896
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
so the quad remember for simplicity's
 

897
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,630
so the quad remember for simplicity's
sake it's your pelvis

898
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,640
sake it's your pelvis
 

899
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,590
sake it's your pelvis
oh you you have your torso here

900
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
oh you you have your torso here
 

901
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,430
oh you you have your torso here
are you with me okay

902
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:18,440
are you with me okay
 

903
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,010
are you with me okay
and this would be like your your belt

904
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,020
and this would be like your your belt
 

905
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,289
and this would be like your your belt
line or something your pubic line and

906
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:24,299
line or something your pubic line and
 

907
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,250
line or something your pubic line and
the claw is in the pelvic region okay

908
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,260
the claw is in the pelvic region okay
 

909
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,970
the claw is in the pelvic region okay
and your rotation

910
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:31,980
and your rotation
 

911
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,370
and your rotation
whatever rotation you get in your spiral

912
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:34,380
whatever rotation you get in your spiral
 

913
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,649
whatever rotation you get in your spiral
rotation externally is in the qua

914
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:39,659

 

915
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,250

meaning and we know this your qua only

916
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:43,260
meaning and we know this your qua only
 

917
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,029
meaning and we know this your qua only
has a limited degree of rotation

918
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
has a limited degree of rotation
 

919
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,510
has a limited degree of rotation
do you see my waist can go further do

920
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:50,520
do you see my waist can go further do
 

921
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,830
do you see my waist can go further do
you see that

922
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
you see that
 

923
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,830
you see that
we don't want to Pivot with our waist

924
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:54,840
we don't want to Pivot with our waist
 

925
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,690
we don't want to Pivot with our waist
because it externally presses

926
00:22:59,690 --> 00:22:59,700
because it externally presses
 

927
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,330
because it externally presses
the lower Tom debt field like if I were

928
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,340
the lower Tom debt field like if I were
 

929
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,169
the lower Tom debt field like if I were
to

930
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:03,179
to
 

931
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,690
to
try to twist the two ends of this ball

932
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:05,700
try to twist the two ends of this ball
 

933
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,690
try to twist the two ends of this ball
I'm going to squeeze the middle out and

934
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:08,700
I'm going to squeeze the middle out and
 

935
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,090
I'm going to squeeze the middle out and
I don't want to do that

936
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,100
I don't want to do that
 

937
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,649
I don't want to do that
I want it to be pressured

938
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:14,659
I want it to be pressured
 

939
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,110
I want it to be pressured
expanding understand so you can't turn

940
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,120
expanding understand so you can't turn
 

941
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,950
expanding understand so you can't turn
your waist you can only turn your cloth

942
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:21,960
your waist you can only turn your cloth
 

943
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,930
your waist you can only turn your cloth
my waist never turns do you see that

944
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:26,940
my waist never turns do you see that
 

945
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,210
my waist never turns do you see that
well when your foot is pointed outward

946
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,220
well when your foot is pointed outward
 

947
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,850
well when your foot is pointed outward
on your front foot your claw can't

948
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:31,860
on your front foot your claw can't
 

949
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,430
on your front foot your claw can't
really turn

950
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:34,440
really turn
 

951
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,450
really turn
all right like this you see I cannot

952
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,460
all right like this you see I cannot
 

953
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,570
all right like this you see I cannot
turn the claw because the tension in the

954
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:41,580
turn the claw because the tension in the
 

955
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,510
turn the claw because the tension in the
knee is stopping it whereas if I turn my

956
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:44,520
knee is stopping it whereas if I turn my
 

957
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,750
knee is stopping it whereas if I turn my
front foot straight I get the quad back

958
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
front foot straight I get the quad back
 

959
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,169
front foot straight I get the quad back
do you see I don't have to turn my waist

960
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:51,179
do you see I don't have to turn my waist
 

961
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,850
do you see I don't have to turn my waist
quad turns

962
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:52,860
quad turns
 

963
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:02,450
quad turns
understood okay

964
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:02,460

 

965
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,230

so let's say what I said so far between

966
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
so let's say what I said so far between
 

967
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,090
so let's say what I said so far between
the concentric nature of what's

968
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,100
the concentric nature of what's
 

969
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,770
the concentric nature of what's
Happening inside of what's happening

970
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:09,780
Happening inside of what's happening
 

971
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,010
Happening inside of what's happening
outside I just discussed only the

972
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,020
outside I just discussed only the
 

973
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,529
outside I just discussed only the
energetic

974
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:15,539
energetic
 

975
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,440
energetic
whoa

976
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,450

 

977
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,049

[Music]

978
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:24,059

 

979
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,230

but the energetic is concentric

980
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,240
but the energetic is concentric
 

981
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,390
but the energetic is concentric
with the Tactical

982
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400

 

983
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,330

if you violate the energetic

984
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,340
if you violate the energetic
 

985
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,909
if you violate the energetic
you're going to violate the Tactical

986
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
you're going to violate the Tactical
 

987
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,649
you're going to violate the Tactical
okay

988
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:39,659
okay
 

989
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,190
okay
when you get a spiraling rotating lower

990
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
when you get a spiraling rotating lower
 

991
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,210
when you get a spiraling rotating lower
tonden field and you use it in a spiral

992
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:47,220
tonden field and you use it in a spiral
 

993
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,490
tonden field and you use it in a spiral
rotating

994
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:48,500
rotating
 

995
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,430
rotating
quinoa's architecture for example

996
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
quinoa's architecture for example
 

997
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,549
quinoa's architecture for example
and most of your throws take and most of

998
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,559
and most of your throws take and most of
 

999
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,649
and most of your throws take and most of
your pins take someone's balance right

1000
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:57,659
your pins take someone's balance right
 

1001
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,810
your pins take someone's balance right
okay

1002
00:24:59,810 --> 00:24:59,820
okay
 

1003
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,450
okay
what this spiral rotation does

1004
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:05,460

 

1005
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,090

is and let's go over the nature again

1006
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,100
is and let's go over the nature again
 

1007
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,210
is and let's go over the nature again
for balance okay so let's just say you

1008
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,220
for balance okay so let's just say you
 

1009
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,610
for balance okay so let's just say you

you see it's gonna go down
 

1107
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,269
you see it's gonna go down
do you see that it's gonna come in up

so

1150
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:15,720
so
 

1151
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,169
so
my edema is not going in the direction

1152
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:20,179
my edema is not going in the direction
 

1153
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,909
my edema is not going in the direction
that he's going

1154
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:22,919
that he's going
 

1155
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,850
that he's going
because my arm is on a different part of

because my arm is on a different part of
 

1157
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,230
because my arm is on a different part of
the Spiral okay
