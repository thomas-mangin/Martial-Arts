00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,030
all right so uh I'm going to address
your question and we'll note the

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,040
your question and we'll note the
 

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,910
your question and we'll note the
following things we've already seen and

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
following things we've already seen and
 

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,390
following things we've already seen and
discussed and demonstrated okay so if

8
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,400
discussed and demonstrated okay so if
 

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,950
discussed and demonstrated okay so if
we're here in

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
we're here in
 

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,710
we're here in
y okay I want to uh seize her center

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:19,720
y okay I want to uh seize her center
 

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,230
y okay I want to uh seize her center
from where we at I'm not just here in

14
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
from where we at I'm not just here in
 

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,150
from where we at I'm not just here in
the house I seize the center from

16
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
the house I seize the center from
 

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,509
the house I seize the center from
wherever I'm at and then I can move her

18
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:26,519
wherever I'm at and then I can move her
 

19
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,790
wherever I'm at and then I can move her
from her Center can move her any old way

20
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
from her Center can move her any old way
 

21
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,630
from her Center can move her any old way
okay Center

22
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640

 

23
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,150

move it's not a matter of taking her

24
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
move it's not a matter of taking her
 

25
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,350
move it's not a matter of taking her
elbow and turning her you just move

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
elbow and turning her you just move
 

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,229
elbow and turning her you just move
her okay so it's

28
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,239
her okay so it's
 

29
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,029
her okay so it's
just from

30
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
just from
 

31
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,110
just from
here in her Palm at the contact seizing

32
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,120
here in her Palm at the contact seizing
 

33
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:05,469
here in her Palm at the contact seizing
her Center moving her Center

34
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:05,479

 

35
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,270

okay so we'll try that they're going to

36
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
okay so we'll try that they're going to
 

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,990
okay so we'll try that they're going to
try that here that's the first thing to

38
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
try that here that's the first thing to
 

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,749
try that here that's the first thing to
know premise number one right so this is

40
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:12,759
know premise number one right so this is
 

41
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,510
know premise number one right so this is
premise 1 a okay so it's not that go

42
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
premise 1 a okay so it's not that go
 

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,310
premise 1 a okay so it's not that go
ahead and get in stance please okay it's

44
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
ahead and get in stance please okay it's
 

45
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,910
ahead and get in stance please okay it's
not that she has spinal displacement

46
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920
not that she has spinal displacement
 

47
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,910
not that she has spinal displacement
push me please and I get out of the

48
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
push me please and I get out of the
 

49
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,870
push me please and I get out of the
way nor in any way she's pushing and I

50
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
way nor in any way she's pushing and I
 

51
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,270
way nor in any way she's pushing and I
get out of the way that's what happening

52
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
get out of the way that's what happening
 

53
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,069
get out of the way that's what happening
okay so if she's pulling now she's

54
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,079
okay so if she's pulling now she's
 

55
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,069
okay so if she's pulling now she's
pulling

56
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
pulling
 

57
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,950
pulling
okay the only difference is that the

58
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
okay the only difference is that the
 

59
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,950
okay the only difference is that the
grounding foot is going to be the front

60
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
grounding foot is going to be the front
 

61
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,630
grounding foot is going to be the front
foot in this case because of how I'm

62
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:45,640
foot in this case because of how I'm
 

63
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,030
foot in this case because of how I'm
standing but the seizure is still the

64
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040

 

65
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,350

same

66
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360

 

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,709

boom okay and so you usually we'll see

68
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:01,719
boom okay and so you usually we'll see
 

69
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,950
boom okay and so you usually we'll see
like I if I if I'm

70
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
like I if I if I'm
 

71
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,270
like I if I if I'm
pulling then you see it's all here in

72
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
pulling then you see it's all here in
 

73
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,430
pulling then you see it's all here in
the grip okay whereas if I push and she

74
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
the grip okay whereas if I push and she
 

75
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,309
the grip okay whereas if I push and she
grounds there's a little seizure there

76
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319
grounds there's a little seizure there
 

77
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,750
grounds there's a little seizure there
but it's really

78
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
but it's really
 

79
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,270
but it's really
external uh in the sense that what we're

80
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
external uh in the sense that what we're
 

81
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,630
external uh in the sense that what we're
using is like we said on the weapons

82
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:21,640
using is like we said on the weapons
 

83
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,790
using is like we said on the weapons
video how do you get IE adhesion on a

84
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
video how do you get IE adhesion on a
 

85
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,790
video how do you get IE adhesion on a
weapons video well if you if you get

86
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:27,800
weapons video well if you if you get
 

87
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,910
weapons video well if you if you get
enough Yong toy pressure you generate a

88
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:30,920
enough Yong toy pressure you generate a
 

89
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,270
enough Yong toy pressure you generate a
kind of pseudo I which is the increase

90
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
kind of pseudo I which is the increase
 

91
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,710
kind of pseudo I which is the increase
in friction as we understand it okay but

92
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
in friction as we understand it okay but
 

93
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,390
in friction as we understand it okay but
as Virginia noted that night you don't

94
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:39,400
as Virginia noted that night you don't
 

95
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,910
as Virginia noted that night you don't
really have the center okay and that's

96
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
really have the center okay and that's
 

97
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,869
really have the center okay and that's
what we're experiencing here so if I

98
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
what we're experiencing here so if I
 

99
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,070
what we're experiencing here so if I
press hard on her and she gets an

100
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
press hard on her and she gets an
 

101
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,589
press hard on her and she gets an
external bracing

102
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
external bracing
 

103
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,790
external bracing
angle there's a kind of friction here

104
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,800
angle there's a kind of friction here
 

105
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,030
angle there's a kind of friction here
and she can kind of move that but you

106
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
and she can kind of move that but you
 

107
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,190
and she can kind of move that but you
can still feel it it's more in my hands

108
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
can still feel it it's more in my hands
 

109
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,710
can still feel it it's more in my hands
but once I start doing the other way she

110
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,720
but once I start doing the other way she
 

111
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,070
but once I start doing the other way she
can't get it because I'm not really

112
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
can't get it because I'm not really
 

113
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,270
can't get it because I'm not really
generating that external pressure so

114
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,280
generating that external pressure so
 

115
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,869
generating that external pressure so
we're going to let our people try this

116
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
we're going to let our people try this
 

117
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,430
we're going to let our people try this
now we'll go to premise two and what we

118
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
now we'll go to premise two and what we
 

119
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,830
now we'll go to premise two and what we
learned from premise one is that I can

120
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:14,840
learned from premise one is that I can
 

121
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,350
learned from premise one is that I can
seize the

122
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360

 

123
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,509

center at touch okay so we're going to

124
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,519
center at touch okay so we're going to
 

125
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,990
center at touch okay so we're going to
expand upon that we also learned in 1 a

126
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
expand upon that we also learned in 1 a
 

127
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,030
expand upon that we also learned in 1 a
that it doesn't it's not about them

128
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
that it doesn't it's not about them
 

129
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,350
that it doesn't it's not about them
pushing getting out of the way or them

okay so here she has no grip her fingers

136
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
okay so here she has no grip her fingers
 

137
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,470
okay so here she has no grip her fingers
are open she could hold wherever

138

are open she could hold wherever
 

139
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,910
are open she could hold wherever
okay he holds wherever and I find the

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
okay he holds wherever and I find the
 

141
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,429
okay he holds wherever and I find the
same connection toenter and we're just

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,710

way okay so we'll try uh premise 2 okay

152
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:17,720
way okay so we'll try uh premise 2 okay
 

153

this is what is happening in premise one
 

155
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,270
this is what is happening in premise one
it's just

156
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,280
it's just
 

157
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,230
it's just
masquerade or

158
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,240

fingers gripping okay the the adhesion

164
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
fingers gripping okay the the adhesion
 

165
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,830
fingers gripping okay the the adhesion

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,390
forward I will match that and we get
stuck so she's trying and I had to

226
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
stuck so she's trying and I had to
 

227
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,790
stuck so she's trying and I had to
increase to keep the equivalency okay

228

so she I'm stuck on there she can't go
 

239
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,830
so she I'm stuck on there she can't go
she can't go forward it's not that she's

240
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:34,840
she can't go forward it's not that she's
 

241
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,550
she can't go forward it's not that she's
pushing in on me it's not that she is

242
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
pushing in on me it's not that she is
 

243
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,230

to go forward she can't go forward you
 

253
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,270
to go forward she can't go forward you
see she can't go forward I'm matching it

254
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
see she can't go forward I'm matching it
 

255

see she can't go forward I'm matching it
she feels friction there so I'm going to

256
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:58,879
she feels friction there so I'm going to
 

257
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,869
she feels friction there so I'm going to
play with the equation and the camera's

258
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:00,879
play with the equation and the camera's
 

259
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,670

skin and I'm going to demonstrate the
 

263
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,710
skin and I'm going to demonstrate the
the friction in my skin

264
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
the friction in my skin
 

265
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,270
the friction in my skin
okay so she's not moving

266
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,280
okay so she's not moving
 

267
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,510
okay so she's not moving
in I will go to her she's trying to push

268
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:16,520
in I will go to her she's trying to push
 

269
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,869
in I will go to her she's trying to push
forward she's trying to push

forward and you can see go back just

272
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:21,879
forward and you can see go back just
 

273
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,550
forward and you can see go back just
make a contact at first so my skin is

274
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
make a contact at first so my skin is
 

275
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,510
make a contact at first so my skin is
there and as she goes and I match that

276
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
there and as she goes and I match that
 

277
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,390
there and as she goes and I match that
you can see my skin is stretching do you

278
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
you can see my skin is stretching do you
 

279
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,469
you can see my skin is stretching do you
see see okay we'll do it again we'll

280
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
see see okay we'll do it again we'll
 

281
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,869
see see okay we'll do it again we'll
watch this hand right here we'll just do

00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:35,879
watch this hand right here we'll just do
 

283
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,550
watch this hand right here we'll just do
one hand for now okay there we are

284
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
one hand for now okay there we are
 

285
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,029
one hand for now okay there we are
there's my skin in place she's not

286
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
there's my skin in place she's not
 

287
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,550
there's my skin in place she's not
gripping we're just lightly touching and

288
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
gripping we're just lightly touching and
 

289
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,270
gripping we're just lightly touching and
as I feel her go forward I press that

290
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
as I feel her go forward I press that
 

291
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,390
as I feel her go forward I press that
and it gets stuck okay premise 2 a

292
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,400
and it gets stuck okay premise 2 a
 

293
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,990
and it gets stuck okay premise 2 a
doesn't change if she goes back the

294
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
doesn't change if she goes back the
 

295
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,830
doesn't change if she goes back the
other way so if I'm loose she'll slip

296
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
other way so if I'm loose she'll slip
 

297
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,710
other way so if I'm loose she'll slip
but if I match it we're stuck and I can

298
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,720
but if I match it we're stuck and I can
 

299
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,469
but if I match it we're stuck and I can
move her in so premise 2

300
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
move her in so premise 2
 

301
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,189
move her in so premise 2
a premise uh 2 a was her trying to go

stuck on the inside premise to

308
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,560
stuck on the inside premise to
 

309
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,990

and displacer okay so come
back so I'm going to do that same thing

484
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
back so I'm going to do that same thing
 

485
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,470
back so I'm going to do that same thing
and we also don't extend the elbow past

486
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,480
and we also don't extend the elbow past
 

487
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,949
and we also don't extend the elbow past
katatori okay so that's where I'm

488
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:45,959
katatori okay so that's where I'm
 

489
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,509
katatori okay so that's where I'm
at and I'm going to figure out I'm going

490
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:48,519
at and I'm going to figure out I'm going
 

491
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,629
at and I'm going to figure out I'm going
to reverse engineer where my front foot

492
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
to reverse engineer where my front foot
 

493
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,430
to reverse engineer where my front foot
is for mun

494
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440

 

495
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,269

get okay come back where you were

496
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:00,279
get okay come back where you were
 

497
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,949
get okay come back where you were
let's find it again put your toes on the

498
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:01,959
let's find it again put your toes on the
 

499
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,750
let's find it again put your toes on the
line we're going to scientifically do

500
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:06,760

 

501
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,910

it okay so my toes on the line now I

502
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
it okay so my toes on the line now I
 

503
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,910
it okay so my toes on the line now I
only only given One

504
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:14,920
only only given One
 

505
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,710
only only given One
Step boom she's on the line and you can

506
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
Step boom she's on the line and you can
 

507
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,629
Step boom she's on the line and you can
see how close we are for munet SK okay

508
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
see how close we are for munet SK okay
 

509
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,870
see how close we are for munet SK okay
we are

510
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:25,880

 

511
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,870

not out

512
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:27,880
not out
 

513
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,949
not out
here okay

514
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
here okay
 

515
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,750
here okay
it doesn't make sense I don't know why

516
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:32,760
it doesn't make sense I don't know why
 

517
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,030
it doesn't make sense I don't know why
that ever started that's goofy as hell

518
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,040
that ever started that's goofy as hell
 

519
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,910
that ever started that's goofy as hell
because on katata

520
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920

 

521
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,949

D that Target is closer to me and I

522
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
D that Target is closer to me and I
 

523
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,470
D that Target is closer to me and I
start about here

524
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
start about here
 

525
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,230
start about here
step but now the target is back

526
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
step but now the target is back
 

527
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,870
step but now the target is back
here therefore my one step should have

528
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
here therefore my one step should have
 

529
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,870
here therefore my one step should have
me

530
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:55,880
me
 

531
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,990
me
closer you see

532
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,000

 

533
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,550

make sense okay

534
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
make sense okay
 

535
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,870
make sense okay
so these mats are traditional to Tommy

536
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
so these mats are traditional to Tommy
 

537
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,949
so these mats are traditional to Tommy
length

538
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:09,959
length
 

539
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,069
length
so one width is 1

540
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079

 

541
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,069

meter I'm just a little over half of a

542
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:17,079
meter I'm just a little over half of a
 

543
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,990
meter I'm just a little over half of a
meter away from her on my body size okay

544
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,000
meter away from her on my body size okay
 

545
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,670
meter away from her on my body size okay
so the drill here is get a little over

546
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,680
so the drill here is get a little over
 

547
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,230
so the drill here is get a little over
half a meter they're just standing in

548
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,240
half a meter they're just standing in
 

549
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,949
half a meter they're just standing in
chenai and oh

550
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
chenai and oh
 

551
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,310
chenai and oh
displace them without hyperextending

552
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
displace them without hyperextending
 

553
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,949
displace them without hyperextending
your elbow okay let's try that back

554
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:37,959

 

555
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,790

onai little over half a meter away from

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
onai little over half a meter away from
 

557
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,069
onai little over half a meter away from
me and premise

558
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:43,079
me and premise
 

559
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,310
me and premise
five

560
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
five
 

561
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,389
five
watch the path of action of the munet G

562
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
watch the path of action of the munet G
 

563
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,430
watch the path of action of the munet G
so the fist starts

564
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,440
so the fist starts
 

565
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,230
so the fist starts
neutral and then the elbows brought back

566
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240

 

567
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,749

and the fist went up from the elbow

568
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:03,759
and the fist went up from the elbow
 

569
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,949
and the fist went up from the elbow
coming back and when the punch goes

570
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
coming back and when the punch goes
 

571
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,269
coming back and when the punch goes
through there's an upward this to the

572
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:10,279
through there's an upward this to the
 

573
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,389
through there's an upward this to the
punch as the elbow re

574
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:15,399

 

575
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,189

extends does not start from back here

576
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:18,199
extends does not start from back here
 

577
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,550
extends does not start from back here
you should have already punched him in

578
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,560
you should have already punched him in
 

579
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,389
you should have already punched him in
the face it starts

580
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
the face it starts
 

581
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,590
the face it starts
neutral it goes back and comes up

582
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,600

 

583
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,230

and as the elbow

584
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
and as the elbow
 

585
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,949
and as the elbow
extends the hand will come up as the

586
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
extends the hand will come up as the
 

587
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,309
extends the hand will come up as the
shoulder becomes the articulation angle

588
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:40,319
shoulder becomes the articulation angle
 

589
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,790
shoulder becomes the articulation angle
okay so

590
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
okay so
 

591
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,150
okay so
munis first goes

592
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,160
munis first goes
 

593
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:52,509
munis first goes
back and up then in and up more okay so

594
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:52,519
back and up then in and up more okay so
 

595
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,269
back and up then in and up more okay so
we're going to do Discovery

596
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:54,279
we're going to do Discovery
 

597
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,829
we're going to do Discovery
learning they're going to observe that

598
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:56,839
learning they're going to observe that
 

599
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,710
learning they're going to observe that
path to action and you are going to feel

600
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
path to action and you are going to feel
 

601
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,629
path to action and you are going to feel
that path of action

602
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:03,639
that path of action
 

603
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,749
that path of action
boom okay premise

604
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759

 

605
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,189

five from the six again working our way

606
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
five from the six again working our way
 

607
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,509
five from the six again working our way
towards k n when it's

608
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:16,519
towards k n when it's
 

609
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,030
towards k n when it's
get the

610
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
get the
 

611
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,470
get the
uh other hand here is a

612
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
uh other hand here is a
 

613
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,949
uh other hand here is a
teming and it is to the veins and

614
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:25,959
teming and it is to the veins and
 

615
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,870
teming and it is to the veins and
arteries on this neck

616
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:29,880
arteries on this neck
 

617
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,150
arteries on this neck
and um it's not

618
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
and um it's not
 

619
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,150
and um it's not
displacing it's

620
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
displacing it's
 

621
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,189
displacing it's
percussive and closer to the surface

622
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
percussive and closer to the surface
 

623
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,910
percussive and closer to the surface
attacking those veins and arteries okay

624
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:42,920
attacking those veins and arteries okay
 

625
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,470
attacking those veins and arteries okay
so meaning it's

626
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
so meaning it's
 

627
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,949
so meaning it's
not

628
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959

 

629
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,230

here he is also coming

630
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
here he is also coming
 

631
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,269
here he is also coming
in in the

632
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:54,279
in in the
 

633
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,629
in in the
attack he has forward

634
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
attack he has forward
 

635
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,389
attack he has forward
inertia you

636
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:01,399

 

637
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,429

there is a hinge here that's why his

638
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:04,439
there is a hinge here that's why his
 

639
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,189
there is a hinge here that's why his
chin can

640
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:06,199
chin can
 

641
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,350
chin can
drop energy is going to be absorbed in

642
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
drop energy is going to be absorbed in
 

643
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,590
drop energy is going to be absorbed in
that

644
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:10,600
that
 

645
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,150
that
hinge I am not trying to displace his

646
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
hinge I am not trying to displace his
 

647
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,789
hinge I am not trying to displace his
spine this becomes a very percussive

648
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:17,799
spine this becomes a very percussive
 

649
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,230
spine this becomes a very percussive
strike where he feels it but his body is

650
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
strike where he feels it but his body is
 

651
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,429
strike where he feels it but his body is
not sagittally displaced okay so he's

652
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
not sagittally displaced okay so he's
 

653
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,950
not sagittally displaced okay so he's
going to walk in

654
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,269
okay and my hand was on top but not
pushing in the last two

820
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:53,279
pushing in the last two
 

821
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,750
pushing in the last two
premises but as you start to feel her

822
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
premises but as you start to feel her
 

823
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,269
premises but as you start to feel her
hand go up will start low elbow tight as

824
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:00,279
hand go up will start low elbow tight as
 

825
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,750
hand go up will start low elbow tight as
her hand starts to go up that's what I

826
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:02,760
her hand starts to go up that's what I
 

827
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,310
her hand starts to go up that's what I
start to take this way you see and use

828
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,320
start to take this way you see and use
 

829
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,750
start to take this way you see and use
my your 90°

830
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
my your 90°
 

831
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,070
my your 90°
fluctuation so we're going to do this

832
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
fluctuation so we're going to do this
 

833
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,149
fluctuation so we're going to do this
drill this way I'm going to get already

834
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
drill this way I'm going to get already
 

835
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,990
drill this way I'm going to get already
in place and I'm going to go

836
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
in place and I'm going to go
 

837
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,830
in place and I'm going to go
here and here I get an adhesion whatever

838
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:22,840
here and here I get an adhesion whatever
 

839
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,830
here and here I get an adhesion whatever
adhesion I got so Sean come

840
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
adhesion I got so Sean come
 

841
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,750
adhesion I got so Sean come
close on this side

842
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
close on this side
 

843
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,149
close on this side
and we'll watch your skin I'll

844
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:31,159
and we'll watch your skin I'll
 

845
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,230
and we'll watch your skin I'll
demonstrate it at the skin level that's

846
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
demonstrate it at the skin level that's
 

847
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,549
demonstrate it at the skin level that's
where I'm at okay there's friction there

848
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:37,559
where I'm at okay there's friction there
 

849
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,990
where I'm at okay there's friction there
and there's friction here okay as she

850
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,000
and there's friction here okay as she
 

851
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,230
and there's friction here okay as she
starts to come up and I use those two to

852
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
starts to come up and I use those two to
 

853
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,390
starts to come up and I use those two to
move her into that curve you

854
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:47,400
move her into that curve you
 

855
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,350
move her into that curve you
see it's no different than when I moved

856
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,360
see it's no different than when I moved
 

857
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,110
see it's no different than when I moved
her from her Center into this curve

858
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
her from her Center into this curve
 

859
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,950
her from her Center into this curve
right here she energy comes up and I

860
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:55,960
right here she energy comes up and I
 

861
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,430
right here she energy comes up and I
move her into the Curve

862
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440

 

863
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,750

I am not pushing against this I'm

864
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:04,760
I am not pushing against this I'm
 

865
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,350
I am not pushing against this I'm
equalizing it and as she start a little

866
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,360
equalizing it and as she start a little
 

867
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,590
equalizing it and as she start a little
lower cuz you're going to come up okay

868
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:10,600
lower cuz you're going to come up okay
 

869
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,830
lower cuz you're going to come up okay
as she comes up that upward energy that

870
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:12,840
as she comes up that upward energy that
 

871
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,669
as she comes up that upward energy that
I feel I don't shove it down I turn

872
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:16,679
I feel I don't shove it down I turn
 

873
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,269
I feel I don't shove it down I turn
it okay that's our next premise try lost

874
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:20,279
it okay that's our next premise try lost
 

875
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,470
it okay that's our next premise try lost
track of which premise we're on so

876
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
track of which premise we're on so
 

877
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,789
track of which premise we're on so
whatever okay again like the earlier

878
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
whatever okay again like the earlier
 

879
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,470
whatever okay again like the earlier
ones it's not that she's coming up and I

880
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:29,480
ones it's not that she's coming up and I
 

881
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,870
ones it's not that she's coming up and I
start to push down and I get some sort

882
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:31,880
start to push down and I get some sort
 

883
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,549
start to push down and I get some sort
of external friction that it's just

884
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
of external friction that it's just
 

885
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,230
of external friction that it's just
that's the cue okay it's not necessary

886
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,240
that's the cue okay it's not necessary
 

887
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,750
that's the cue okay it's not necessary
so for example she could not come up

888
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:42,760
so for example she could not come up
 

889
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,830
so for example she could not come up
just relax woman okay she could just be

890
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
just relax woman okay she could just be
 

891
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,870
just relax woman okay she could just be
there and you're going to still stick do

892
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:47,880
there and you're going to still stick do
 

893
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,830
there and you're going to still stick do
you see because you can stick anywhere

894
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:50,840
you see because you can stick anywhere
 

895
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,789
you see because you can stick anywhere
okay doesn't doesn't matter so if Johan

896
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:53,799
okay doesn't doesn't matter so if Johan
 

897
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,870
okay doesn't doesn't matter so if Johan
didn't see it I'm just here and I just

898
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:55,880
didn't see it I'm just here and I just
 

899
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,149
didn't see it I'm just here and I just
stick here

900
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:01,159

 

901
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,269

likewise uh she could be pulling

902
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
likewise uh she could be pulling
 

903
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,390
likewise uh she could be pulling
backwards she could be like trying to

904
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,400
backwards she could be like trying to
 

905
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,310
backwards she could be like trying to
back

906
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320

 

907
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,269

up we're going to get stuck okay so

908
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
up we're going to get stuck okay so
 

909
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,110
up we're going to get stuck okay so
we'll try that one okay one no upper

910
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,120
we'll try that one okay one no upper
 

911
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,990
we'll try that one okay one no upper
pressure which is the Q when you do it

912
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,000
pressure which is the Q when you do it
 

913
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,070
pressure which is the Q when you do it
and then two they're trying to pull back

914
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,080
and then two they're trying to pull back
 

915
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,710
and then two they're trying to pull back
off of it okay try Okay so we're on the

916
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:21,720
off of it okay try Okay so we're on the
 

917
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,669
off of it okay try Okay so we're on the
next premise we know at a certain

918
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:24,679
next premise we know at a certain
 

919
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,990
next premise we know at a certain
point that the punch is going to

920
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,000
point that the punch is going to
 

921
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,230
point that the punch is going to
elongate the left

922
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,240
elongate the left
 

923
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,230
elongate the left
to here right we know that okay and as

924
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,240
to here right we know that okay and as
 

925
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,190
to here right we know that okay and as
it does that the disin becomes more Yin

926
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
it does that the disin becomes more Yin
 

927
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,110
it does that the disin becomes more Yin
it's get gets so lift up so example go

928
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,120
it's get gets so lift up so example go
 

929
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,149

about what I'm telling you to do okay

932
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:47,960
about what I'm telling you to do okay
 

933
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,510
about what I'm telling you to do okay
just do what I say so here her fist is

934
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
just do what I say so here her fist is
 

935
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,750
just do what I say so here her fist is
back and close to her body her elbows

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:54,760
back and close to her body her elbows
 

937
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,149
back and close to her body her elbows
closed don't let me push it down don't

938
00:24:57,149 --> 00:24:57,159
closed don't let me push it down don't
 

939
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,950
closed don't let me push it down don't
let me change it position positioning in

940
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
let me change it position positioning in
 

941
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,070
let me change it position positioning in
space from there to here don't let me do

942
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
space from there to here don't let me do
 

943
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,029
space from there to here don't let me do
it got

944
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039

 

945
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,430

it okay extend it out and don't let me

946
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
it okay extend it out and don't let me
 

947
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,549
it okay extend it out and don't let me
change it from here let me move it let

948
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
change it from here let me move it let
 

949
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,870
change it from here let me move it let
me move it to here don't let me do

950
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
me move it to here don't let me do
 

951
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,630
me move it to here don't let me do
that you see because it's further away

952
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:21,640
that you see because it's further away
 

953
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,310
that you see because it's further away
from her body you get it so it has a Yin

954
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,320
from her body you get it so it has a Yin
 

955
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,110
from her body you get it so it has a Yin
face going by

956
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
face going by
 

957
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,950
face going by
Ro a Yang face coming

958
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
Ro a Yang face coming
 

959
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,070
Ro a Yang face coming
out and then it's re-entering its Yin

960
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
out and then it's re-entering its Yin
 

961
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,350
out and then it's re-entering its Yin
phase again

962
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
phase again
 

963
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,430
phase again
okay and so that means as it comes out I

964
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
okay and so that means as it comes out I
 

965
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,909
okay and so that means as it comes out I
am going to start moving her this way in

966
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:46,919
am going to start moving her this way in
 

967
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,149
am going to start moving her this way in
the

968
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
the
 

969
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,990
the
spiral but as it comes away from her

970
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
spiral but as it comes away from her
 

971
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,830
spiral but as it comes away from her
body I also finish your punch I let it

972
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:56,840
body I also finish your punch I let it
 

973
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,070
body I also finish your punch I let it
go down too

974
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,080
go down too
 

975
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,669
go down too
okay do you guys understand that got

976
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
okay do you guys understand that got
 

977
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,510
okay do you guys understand that got
that that's the timing of when to do it

okay so as you
 

981
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,630
okay so as you
experience the

1027
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,750

that's not what I wanted but okay you're

1028
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
that's not what I wanted but okay you're
 

1029
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,510
that's not what I wanted but okay you're
you I'll do it with my finger okay so

1030
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,520
you I'll do it with my finger okay so
 

1031
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,909
you I'll do it with my finger okay so
she

1032
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
she
 

1033
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,470
she
goes here's the adhesion out

1034
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
goes here's the adhesion out
 

1035
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,190
goes here's the adhesion out
and it's just my finger so whatever felt

1036
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,200
and it's just my finger so whatever felt
 

1037
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,149
and it's just my finger so whatever felt
heavy to her it couldn't actually been

1038
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:35,159
heavy to her it couldn't actually been
 

1039
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,310
heavy to her it couldn't actually been
that heavy for me to apply it does feel

1040
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
that heavy for me to apply it does feel
 

1041
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,630
that heavy for me to apply it does feel
heavy to the UK but I'm not really

1042
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
heavy to the UK but I'm not really
 

1043
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,190
heavy to the UK but I'm not really
applying that great strength if you were

1044
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
applying that great strength if you were
 

1045
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,070
applying that great strength if you were
to feel that you were applying a great

1046
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,080
to feel that you were applying a great
 

1047
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,669
to feel that you were applying a great
strength you were in a y y contestation

1048
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
strength you were in a y y contestation
 

1049
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,389
strength you were in a y y contestation
you need to go more

1050
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:49,399
you need to go more
 

1051
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,630
you need to go more
around in order to go more down okay

1052
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
around in order to go more down okay
 

1053
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,430
around in order to go more down okay
that's how that works um so that's our

1054
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
that's how that works um so that's our
 

1055
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,710
that's how that works um so that's our
next experiment I start here and as

1056
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
next experiment I start here and as
 

1057
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,789
next experiment I start here and as
she's going it goes out that's where I

1058
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:01,799
she's going it goes out that's where I
 

1059
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,990
she's going it goes out that's where I
take that down okay let's try

1060
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
take that down okay let's try
 

1061
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,549
take that down okay let's try
that if you we're back on the last dral

1062
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:09,559
that if you we're back on the last dral
 

1063
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,590
that if you we're back on the last dral
so as her hand goes out and I started

1064
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:12,600
so as her hand goes out and I started
 

1065
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,710
so as her hand goes out and I started
going this way then it gets light and I

1066
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
going this way then it gets light and I
 

1067
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,430
going this way then it gets light and I
move it around we're going to watch her

1068
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
move it around we're going to watch her
 

1069
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,549
move it around we're going to watch her
head her head is this high off the

1070
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:21,559
head her head is this high off the
 

1071
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,870
head her head is this high off the
ground all that

1072
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
ground all that
 

1073
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,870
ground all that
happens her head gets lower

1074
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880

 

1075
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,230

we now combine the other adhesion okay

1076
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
we now combine the other adhesion okay
 

1077
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,950
we now combine the other adhesion okay
out it all comes lower there's her head

1078
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:37,960
out it all comes lower there's her head
 

1079
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,789
out it all comes lower there's her head
head went under my hand I did not shove

1080
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:41,799
head went under my hand I did not shove
 

1081
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,509
head went under my hand I did not shove
like my

1082
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:43,519
like my
 

1083
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,430
like my
teacher try to shove her down okay I

1084
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
teacher try to shove her down okay I
 

1085
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,509
teacher try to shove her down okay I
bring her head to me so

1086
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:51,519
bring her head to me so
 

1087
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,310
bring her head to me so
in so again to her like she can't pick

1088
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,320
in so again to her like she can't pick
 

1089
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,590
in so again to her like she can't pick
her head up she won't be able to pick

1090
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
her head up she won't be able to pick
 

1091
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,990
her head up she won't be able to pick
her head up you feel like that's strong

1092
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,000
her head up you feel like that's strong
 

1093
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,389
her head up you feel like that's strong
but I'll do it with my

1094
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399

 

1095
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,149

finger okay so we'll add that now okay

1096
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,159
finger okay so we'll add that now okay
 

1097

question the
 

1099
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,070
question the
mechanisms are the same we always do

1100
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
mechanisms are the same we always do
 

1101

people will just

1114
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
people will just
 

1115
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,669
people will just
root and contest and say it's an

concentrically the reconciliation of Y
 

1121
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,190
concentrically the reconciliation of Y
and yangong that is happening internally

and yangong that is happening internally
 

1123
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,549
and yangong that is happening internally
should happen externally because I know

1124
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
should happen externally because I know
 

1125
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,789
should happen externally because I know

stupid um the last part
 

1139
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,990
stupid um the last part
is or the second part of your question

1140
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,000
is or the second part of your question
 

1141
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,350
is or the second part of your question
is how much energy it's like there's I'm

1142
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
is how much energy it's like there's I'm
 

1143
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,909
is how much energy it's like there's I'm
trying to do no energy okay just enough

1144
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
trying to do no energy okay just enough
 

1145
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,870
trying to do no energy okay just enough
to stick so the energy is equal to her

1146
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
to stick so the energy is equal to her
 

1147
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,310
to stick so the energy is equal to her
but it's at 90° fluctuation so as far as

1148
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
but it's at 90° fluctuation so as far as
 

1149
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,830
but it's at 90° fluctuation so as far as
my output is it's very light I don't

1150
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:24,840
my output is it's very light I don't
 

1151
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,310
my output is it's very light I don't
feel anything so traditionally I've

1152
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,320
feel anything so traditionally I've
 

1153
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,950
feel anything so traditionally I've
heard different values they say it's

1154
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
heard different values they say it's
 

1155
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,389
heard different values they say it's
about 2 lb of pressure about 4 lbs of

1156
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:31,399
about 2 lb of pressure about 4 lbs of
 

1157
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,029
about 2 lb of pressure about 4 lbs of
pressure but you already know that's

1158
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
pressure but you already know that's
 

1159
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,190
pressure but you already know that's
 because the Chinese didn't use

1160
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
because the Chinese didn't use
 

1161
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,029
because the Chinese didn't use
the pound system okay that's a British

1162
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,039
the pound system okay that's a British
 

1163
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,350
the pound system okay that's a British
thing um or an English thing or an

1164
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,360
thing um or an English thing or an
 

1165
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,269
thing um or an English thing or an
eventually an American thing and it's

1166
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:44,279
eventually an American thing and it's
 

1167
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,070
eventually an American thing and it's
like no and they didn't use the metric

1168
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
like no and they didn't use the metric
 

1169
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,029
like no and they didn't use the metric
system whatever it is it's very

1170
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:48,039
system whatever it is it's very
 

1171
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,950
system whatever it is it's very
light okay it shouldn't if if I ever

1172
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
light okay it shouldn't if if I ever
 

1173
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,909
light okay it shouldn't if if I ever
felt like I actually had to Ump

1174
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:52,919
felt like I actually had to Ump
 

1175
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,909

00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
that okay like my teacher
 

1181
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,990

did um okay the last thing you do and

1182
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
did um okay the last thing you do and
 

1183
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,870
did um okay the last thing you do and
which is highly covered in that video

you link is I got to do all that I just

1186
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
you link is I got to do all that I just
 

1187
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,789
you link is I got to do all that I just
did and set up the x

1188
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:11,799
did and set up the x
 

1189
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,669
did and set up the x
pattern uh so that means I got to be in

1190
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:14,679
pattern uh so that means I got to be in
 

1191
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:17,909
pattern uh so that means I got to be in
the middle of her

1192
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:17,919
the middle of her

1196
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:26,279
sagittal plane such that the young hand
 

1197
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,990
sagittal plane such that the young hand
is going to run into to her inertia that

1198
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,000
is going to run into to her inertia that
 

1199
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,990
is going to run into to her inertia that
I internalize and project okay so and we

1200
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,000
I internalize and project okay so and we
 

1201
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,389
I internalize and project okay so and we
get in her her stance she goes to strike

1202
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
get in her her stance she goes to strike
 

1203
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,629
get in her her stance she goes to strike
I do that whole thing and as I bring her

1204
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:40,639
I do that whole thing and as I bring her
 

1205
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:43,669
I do that whole thing and as I bring her
forward this is the front inward kazushi

1206
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
forward this is the front inward kazushi
 

1207
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,909
forward this is the front inward kazushi
that's where that's going to be right

1208
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
that's where that's going to be right
 

1209
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,100
that's where that's going to be right

okay as she comes

1220
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:02,760
okay as she comes
 

1221
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,789
okay as she comes
in the iky hand has to bring her around

1222
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
in the iky hand has to bring her around
 

1223
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,190
in the iky hand has to bring her around

into that
 

1225
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,830
into that
pattern and you will feel the force

1226
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:10,840
pattern and you will feel the force
 

1227
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,990

okay she's going in and you can you're

1234
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:24,679
okay she's going in and you can you're
 

1235
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,549
okay she's going in and you can you're
going to feel that it's pressure do you

1236
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:27,559
going to feel that it's pressure do you
 

1237
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,710
going to feel that it's pressure do you
see eventually it gets light right

1238
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:29,720
see eventually it gets light right
 

1239
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,870
see eventually it gets light right
here's light and then it got heavy again

1240
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:31,880
here's light and then it got heavy again
 

1241
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,590
here's light and then it got heavy again
at the end you see that as it's passing

1242
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:34,600
at the end you see that as it's passing
 

1243
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,269
at the end you see that as it's passing
through its phases so I'm not going to

1244
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:36,279
through its phases so I'm not going to
 

1245
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,870
through its phases so I'm not going to
throw her but I'll displace her a little

1246
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:39,880
throw her but I'll displace her a little
 

1247
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,110
throw her but I'll displace her a little
as she

1248
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
as she
 

1249
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,909
as she
feels that okay that's what you're doing

1250
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:44,919
feels that okay that's what you're doing
 

1251
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,990
feels that okay that's what you're doing
now the scaredy cat UK is going to feel

1252
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
now the scaredy cat UK is going to feel
 

1253
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,149
now the scaredy cat UK is going to feel
that we'll come to here and when they

1254
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:53,159
that we'll come to here and when they
 

1255
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,870
that we'll come to here and when they
feel the center they kind of absorb it

1256
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:57,880
feel the center they kind of absorb it
 

1257
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,830
feel the center they kind of absorb it
they feel that projecting so let me show

1258
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
they feel that projecting so let me show
 

1259
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,190
they feel that projecting so let me show
the projection first okay the projection

1260
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,200
the projection first okay the projection
 

1261
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,629
the projection first okay the projection
is right

1262
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:03,639
is right
 

1263
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,269
is right
there they absorb it by taking energy

1264
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
there they absorb it by taking energy
 

1265
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,750
there they absorb it by taking energy
away you see that so as they do that you

1266
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:10,760
away you see that so as they do that you
 

1267
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,629
away you see that so as they do that you
follow it in and you take the next

1268
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:13,639
follow it in and you take the next
 

1269
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:16,950
follow it in and you take the next
projection point which is the HP and out

1270
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
projection point which is the HP and out
 

1271
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,029
projection point which is the HP and out
there go okay they're going to try that

1272
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:20,039
there go okay they're going to try that
 

1273
