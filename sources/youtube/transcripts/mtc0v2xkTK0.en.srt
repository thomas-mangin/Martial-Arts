00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,112
Today I'm going to show you how to tie your belt.

2
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to show you the easiest way to do it.

3
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:14,196
It's not necessarily the "traditional" way,

4
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:17,332
but it's a way that works well and makes sure that it's all well set.

5
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:21,757
The first thing you do is to take it like this and fold it in half.

6
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:27,616
Make sur that the label is on the inside as you fold, not on the outside,

7
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,164
because at the end, you want the label to be out.

8
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,300
So here it is, fold it in half,

9
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:35,435
and then you're going to close your vest,

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,721
like this, 

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,024
nice and tight.

12
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:43,437
Then you're going to place the center of the belt under your belly button.

13
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,437
Then you're going to wrap it around.

14
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,416
Like this.

15
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,945
Now from that point, what you want to do,

16
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:54,378
you're going to see that behind me, there is a cross here.

17
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:58,323
What you want to do is to straighten it because when you take ukemi, it can be a bit painful.

18
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:02,538
So put the thumb from your right hand

19
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:07,063
and slide the knot so that it goes to the front.

20
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:13,461
Then when it's at the front, it's going to being this side of the belt under the rest.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,636
Then you're going to take the bit which is at the top,

22
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,922
and you're going to roll it under.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,660
You roll it under and you take it back up.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,841
From that point, you can center your belt a little bit.

25
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:34,575
Then you're going to take the bottom part and place it like this in the front.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,079
Right in the front, like this,

27
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:39,933
and you're going to make the top part go under,

28
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:42,842
and back like this.

29
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,502
Then you end up with the belt like this.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,775
This way, when you wear the hakama, you can hide it under.

31
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,736
You can also wear it down like this,

32
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,740
but it makes kind of a mess here so it's not as clean, so I prefer like this.

33
00:01:56,001 --> 00:02:01,827
Then as you saw it at the beginning, the label here is showing upwards,

34
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:03,646
as opposed to being like this.

35
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:08,159
That comes from the fact that you folded your belt with the label inside.
