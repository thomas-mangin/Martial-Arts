so many

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
so many
 

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,090
so many
people in the world not only doing

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,810

think that good technical

know and I don't know that many to be
 

29
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,330

honest

30
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,340

 

31
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,170

it seems to be an all-encompassing art

32
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,180
it seems to be an all-encompassing art
 

33
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,250
it seems to be an all-encompassing art
but more playing on the mind

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,260
but more playing on the mind
 

35
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,229
but more playing on the mind
than the technical

36
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
than the technical
 

37
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,050

ago
 

251
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,210
ago
but I still know that when I started I

252
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,220
but I still know that when I started I
 

253
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,570
but I still know that when I started I
didn't start it to learn a martial art

254
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:41,580
didn't start it to learn a martial art
 

255
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,610
didn't start it to learn a martial art
started it because somebody talked me

256
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:43,620
started it because somebody talked me
 

257
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,150
started it because somebody talked me
into it and if you've got my book it'll

258
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,160
into it and if you've got my book it'll
 

259
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,610
into it and if you've got my book it'll
tell you in there why I started and how

260
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
tell you in there why I started and how
 

261
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,909
tell you in there why I started and how
it came about

262
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:52,919

 

263
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,370

to me Aikido must work as a martial art

264
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
to me Aikido must work as a martial art
 

265
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,950
to me Aikido must work as a martial art
but most of the techniques that are

266
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
but most of the techniques that are
 

267
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,309
but most of the techniques that are
performed won't work as a martial art

268
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
performed won't work as a martial art
 

269
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,430
performed won't work as a martial art
because they're too long

270
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
because they're too long
 

271
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,710
because they're too long
they have to be much shorter

272
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:09,720
they have to be much shorter
 

273
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,890
they have to be much shorter
and that's why when you watch Masters
