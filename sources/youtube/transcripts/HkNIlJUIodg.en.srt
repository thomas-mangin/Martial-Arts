okay um right now we're using tension we
 

29
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,590
okay um right now we're using tension we
don't realize it we're using tension out

30

don't realize it we're using tension out
 

31
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,510
don't realize it we're using tension out
of

32
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
of
 

33
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,549

skeletal
 

115

skeletal
alignment what I'm going to try to do is

116
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
alignment what I'm going to try to do is
 

117
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,589
alignment what I'm going to try to do is
use the skeletal alignment and bear with

118
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:52,599
use the skeletal alignment and bear with

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,750
me this is all Poetics I'm going to use
the skeletal alignment to generate an

122
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
the skeletal alignment to generate an
 

123
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,750
the skeletal alignment to generate an
upward and energy such that my soft

124

upward and energy such that my soft
 

125
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,990
upward and energy such that my soft
tissue my muscles Etc can generate a

126
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
tissue my muscles Etc can generate a
 

127
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,630
tissue my muscles Etc can generate a
descending energy okay that's what I'm

128
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:09,640
descending energy okay that's what I'm
 

129
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,070

going to tilt my pelvis on that do you

510
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:09,079
going to tilt my pelvis on that do you
 

511
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,790
going to tilt my pelvis on that do you
see how I did that so the last drill I

512
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
see how I did that so the last drill I
 

513
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,670
see how I did that so the last drill I
didn't okay on this drill oh I am going

514
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
didn't okay on this drill oh I am going
 

515
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,310
didn't okay on this drill oh I am going
to tilt it I tilt the PBS so I'm making

516
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
to tilt it I tilt the PBS so I'm making
 

517
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,749
to tilt it I tilt the PBS so I'm making
figure eight it's almost like I'm rowing

518

backwards rowing backwards do you see

520
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
backwards rowing backwards do you see
 

521
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,110
backwards rowing backwards do you see
that can you is it visible or no okay so

522
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,120
that can you is it visible or no okay so
 

523
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,710
that can you is it visible or no okay so
I'm roll backwards and then when you're

524
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm roll backwards and then when you're
 

525
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm roll backwards and then when you're
ready you'll go fig F A the other way

526
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:29,800
ready you'll go fig F A the other way
 

527
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,790
ready you'll go fig F A the other way
figure a the other way without turning

528
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
figure a the other way without turning
 

529
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,110
figure a the other way without turning
the knee in okay try figure eight

530
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,120

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
sides then you reverse it so if you were
 

537
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,509
sides then you reverse it so if you were
kaying you're going backwards and you're

like I did before but now I'm going to

582
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
like I did before but now I'm going to
 

583
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,110
like I did before but now I'm going to
bring that attention that observation

584
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
bring that attention that observation
 

585
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:23,110
bring that attention that observation
here let that part drop as

586
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120

 

587
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,549

well I don't pull anything down I don't

588
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
well I don't pull anything down I don't
 

589
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,789
well I don't pull anything down I don't
do anything just keep trying to relax

590
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:30,799
do anything just keep trying to relax
 

591
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,230
do anything just keep trying to relax
release any flexion release any

592
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,240
release any flexion release any
 

593
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,110
release any flexion release any
flexion and by releasing the flexion I

594
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
flexion and by releasing the flexion I
 

595
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,029
flexion and by releasing the flexion I
let go of that spot and then I'm

596
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:42,039
let go of that spot and then I'm
 

597
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,710
let go of that spot and then I'm
observant of what happens when I let go

598
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
observant of what happens when I let go
 

599
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,110
observant of what happens when I let go
that spot okay try

600
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,120
that spot okay try
 

601
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,190
that spot okay try
that okay now we'll go into

602
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200

 

603
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,390

SE same

604
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,400
SE same
 

605
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,789
SE same
thing I'm going to stack my skeletal

606
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:01,799
thing I'm going to stack my skeletal
 

607
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,710
thing I'm going to stack my skeletal
tissue in this case it's going to be my

608
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:03,720
tissue in this case it's going to be my
 

609
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,070
tissue in this case it's going to be my
pelvis and my spine and my head okay

610
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080
pelvis and my spine and my head okay
 

611
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,110
pelvis and my spine and my head okay
we'll just have our hands down here by

612
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
we'll just have our hands down here by
 

613
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,430
we'll just have our hands down here by
our

614
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:12,440

 

615
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,909

knees you're going to have to figure out

616
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
knees you're going to have to figure out
 

617
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,710
knees you're going to have to figure out
what is the pelvis angle that Stacks the

618
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:19,720
what is the pelvis angle that Stacks the
 

619
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,110
what is the pelvis angle that Stacks the
spine on the pel on the uh pelvis okay

620
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,120
spine on the pel on the uh pelvis okay
 

621
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,990
spine on the pel on the uh pelvis okay
so for example if I'm here like this I

622
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,000
so for example if I'm here like this I
 

623
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,390
so for example if I'm here like this I
tilt my pelvis down

624
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
tilt my pelvis down
 

625
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,750
tilt my pelvis down
I my spine is not stacked on it do you

626
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:32,760
I my spine is not stacked on it do you
 

627
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,510
I my spine is not stacked on it do you
guys see that okay so that creates

628
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
guys see that okay so that creates
 

629
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,190
guys see that okay so that creates
pressure somewhere around

630
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,200
pressure somewhere around
 

631
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,909
pressure somewhere around
here you don't want that so I'll change

632
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
here you don't want that so I'll change
 

633
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,230
here you don't want that so I'll change
my

634
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,240
my
 

635
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,750
my
pelvis till that pressure goes

636
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:46,760
pelvis till that pressure goes
 

637
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,430
pelvis till that pressure goes
away until my

638
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
away until my
 

639
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,950
away until my
spine can just do nothing because it's

640
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:53,960
spine can just do nothing because it's
 

641
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,510
spine can just do nothing because it's
stacked on

642
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
stacked on
 

643
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,950
stacked on
itself once I hit that spot to do

644
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:01,799
exactly what I've been doing you may
 

647
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,990
exactly what I've been doing you may
have tension in your thighs and your

648
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,000
have tension in your thighs and your
 

649
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,590
have tension in your thighs and your
knees and your

knees and your
 

651
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,070
knees and your
ankles that you have to release you

652
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,080
ankles that you have to release you
 

653
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,390
ankles that you have to release you
don't have to stretch it you have to

654
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,400
don't have to stretch it you have to
 

655
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,510
don't have to stretch it you have to
release

656
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
release
 

657
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,470
release
it so I'm letting go of all

658
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480

 

659
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,190

that and when I'm ready I take that last

660
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
that and when I'm ready I take that last
 

661
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,270
that and when I'm ready I take that last
drill bring my observation there

662
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
drill bring my observation there
 

663
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:45,110
drill bring my observation there
and I release

664
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120

 

665
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,909

it again some metrics that you can use I

666
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:48,919
it again some metrics that you can use I
 

667
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,149
it again some metrics that you can use I
always hesitant to give metrics but if

668
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,159

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,950
he's a psychological Catalyst that
triggers me into

838
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
triggers me into
 

839
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,990
triggers me into
tension so I did all my warm-ups I did

840
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
tension so I did all my warm-ups I did
 

841
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,830
tension so I did all my warm-ups I did
all my

842
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
all my
 

843
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,430
all my
stretches I should be sunk and so when

844
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
stretches I should be sunk and so when
 

845
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,029
stretches I should be sunk and so when
he goes to push I now have a chance to

846
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:50,039
he goes to push I now have a chance to
 

847
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,510
he goes to push I now have a chance to
get even more released because of the

848
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
get even more released because of the
 

849
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,710
get even more released because of the
Catalyst wants me to do the

850
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:55,720
Catalyst wants me to do the
 

851
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,470
Catalyst wants me to do the
opposite so I do doing everything

852
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
opposite so I do doing everything
 

853
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,789
opposite so I do doing everything
exactly the same that I was doing before

854
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
exactly the same that I was doing before

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:09,880
to do this okay so your chin is slightly
 

861
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,950
to do this okay so your chin is slightly
down and slightly back because to stack

862
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
down and slightly back because to stack
 

863
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,149
down and slightly back because to stack
my vertebrae I can't do that do you see

864
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
my vertebrae I can't do that do you see
 

865
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,350
my vertebrae I can't do that do you see
that so it has to go slightly

866
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
that so it has to go slightly
 

867
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,029
that so it has to go slightly
back I can't be up here cuz I'm leaning

868
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
back I can't be up here cuz I'm leaning
 

869
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,029
back I can't be up here cuz I'm leaning
back do you see that so I'm over here

870
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:28,039
back do you see that so I'm over here
 

871
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,510
back do you see that so I'm over here
and then as he's pushing I just keep

872
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:32,520
and then as he's pushing I just keep
 

873
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,990
and then as he's pushing I just keep
releasing and releasing anything that

874
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
releasing and releasing anything that
 

875
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:55,230
releasing and releasing anything that
was flexed I keep my mind

876
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,240

 

877
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,029

883
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,149

side so in normal assumption this is a

884
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:17,159
side so in normal assumption this is a
 

885
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,110
side so in normal assumption this is a
tricep

886
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
tricep
 

887
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,190
tricep
extension do you guys understand that

888
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,200
extension do you guys understand that
 

889
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,389
extension do you guys understand that
okay and uh again almost embarrassingly

890
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:28,399
okay and uh again almost embarrassingly
 

891
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,110
okay and uh again almost embarrassingly
I do have tricep muscles okay but you're

892
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
I do have tricep muscles okay but you're
 

893
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,830
I do have tricep muscles okay but you're
going to watch and I'm going to get

894
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:34,840
going to watch and I'm going to get
 

895
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,310
going to watch and I'm going to get
myself in that position where I can be

896
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
myself in that position where I can be
 

897
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:49,990
myself in that position where I can be
totally released and

898
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000

 

899
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,430

relaxed and then Taylor you can just

900
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440
relaxed and then Taylor you can just
 

901
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,909
relaxed and then Taylor you can just
kind of push in these all these mushy

902
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
kind of push in these all these mushy
 

903
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,470
kind of push in these all these mushy
places especially go to the other side

904
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
places especially go to the other side
 

905
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,549
places especially go to the other side
where I put you camera the tricep is

906
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
where I put you camera the tricep is
 

907
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,950
where I put you camera the tricep is
embarrassingly

908
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
embarrassingly
 

909
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,350
embarrassingly
squishy you see that what it say like

910
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,360
squishy you see that what it say like
 

911

913
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,990
see I do have muscles okay but I'm not
using them and then if you come

914
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
using them and then if you come
 

915
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,750
using them and then if you come
up and you poke around it's not a bench

916
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
up and you poke around it's not a bench
 

917
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,990
up and you poke around it's not a bench
press exercise again I do have pecs but

918
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
press exercise again I do have pecs but
 

919
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,990
press exercise again I do have pecs but
they're surprisingly

920
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
they're surprisingly
 

921
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,990
they're surprisingly
mushy

922
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
mushy
 

923
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,830
mushy
okay got it

924
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840

 

925
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,149

okay that is difficult because this is a

926
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:33,159
okay that is difficult because this is a
 

927
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,269
okay that is difficult because this is a
huge Catalyst for us but it starts in

928
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:36,279
huge Catalyst for us but it starts in
 

929
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,470
huge Catalyst for us but it starts in
the other stuff okay if we look at the

930
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,480
the other stuff okay if we look at the
 

931
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,110
the other stuff okay if we look at the
other drills I'm telling you to relax

932
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,120
other drills I'm telling you to relax
 

933
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,190
other drills I'm telling you to relax
and you're

934
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,200
and you're
 

935
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,389
and you're
like okay so but it is still that's you

936
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
like okay so but it is still that's you
 

937
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,870
like okay so but it is still that's you
have to do those drills to relax you

938
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
have to do those drills to relax you
 

939
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,430
have to do those drills to relax you
have to be able to sit in Sea to relax

940
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:54,440
have to be able to sit in Sea to relax
 

941
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,310
have to be able to sit in Sea to relax
and then you could do this so we're

942
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
and then you could do this so we're
 

943
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,549
and then you could do this so we're
going to do this drill anyways even

944
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
going to do this drill anyways even
 

945
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,549
going to do this drill anyways even
though it might be above most of us here

946
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:01,559
though it might be above most of us here
 

947
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,990
though it might be above most of us here
but the mechanics is the same okay got

948
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,000
but the mechanics is the same okay got
 

949
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,710
but the mechanics is the same okay got
it so if you don't it doesn't look like

950
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
it so if you don't it doesn't look like
 

951
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,830
it so if you don't it doesn't look like

everything but I can't relax my
spine the skeletal system H is going to

996
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
spine the skeletal system H is going to
 

997
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,590
spine the skeletal system H is going to
be stacked on each other

998
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:22,600
be stacked on each other
 

999
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,149
be stacked on each other
okay and then I told you is seated
