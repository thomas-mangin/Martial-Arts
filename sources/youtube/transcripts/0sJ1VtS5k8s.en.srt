with your crossalle arm. So, it's his
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,230

behind the elbow tricep area. And I'm
 

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,430
behind the elbow tricep area. And I'm
just going to pull him past here. Pull

just going to pull him past here. Pull
 

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,349
just going to pull him past here. Pull
still. When you pull, we're not going

12
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
still. When you pull, we're not going
 

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,510

pulling past me, but down this way. My
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,650

107
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,270

Let's say as we're walking towards him,

108
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's say as we're walking towards him,
 

109
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,070
Let's say as we're walking towards him,
he starts to take a fighting stance, but

110
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
he starts to take a fighting stance, but
 

111
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,309
he starts to take a fighting stance, but
then we're not closing. Now we have

112
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
then we're not closing. Now we have
 

113
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,110
then we're not closing. Now we have
assaulted. Okay, we out comes the taser,

out comes the taunt. Got it. So, it's
 

117
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,390
out comes the taunt. Got it. So, it's
the guy who's passive. But if I run

118
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
the guy who's passive. But if I run
 

119
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,190
the guy who's passive. But if I run
towards him and now he draws a weapon,

120
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
towards him and now he draws a weapon,
 

121
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,070
towards him and now he draws a weapon,
now we're out of luck. I can't get my

122
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
now we're out of luck. I can't get my
 

123
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,910
now we're out of luck. I can't get my
force option anymore. So, it's as I can

124
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
force option anymore. So, it's as I can
 

125
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,550
force option anymore. So, it's as I can
only move as fast as I can process

126
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
only move as fast as I can process
 

127
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,110
only move as fast as I can process
information. And you probably can't do

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
information. And you probably can't do
 

129
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,550
information. And you probably can't do
it at a jog. Okay. So, we're just

And that's not only going to get the arm
 

163
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,869
And that's not only going to get the arm
right faster, but if he throws the

164
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
right faster, but if he throws the
 

165
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,430
right faster, but if he throws the
strike, I'm right there for the strike.

166

189
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,270
where the guy stays still. If you stay
still, we'll do that. Okay? But a lot of

like moving like that. So now if he was
 

195
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,830
like moving like that. So now if he was
primary and I start moving towards that,

The civilian is going to try to grapple
with that guy. We're not the civilian.

with that guy. We're not the civilian.
We're going to bring force options in

Okay. So, that's why we don't go grapple

282
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay. So, that's why we don't go grapple
 

283
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,070
Okay. So, that's why we don't go grapple
people because I'm not grappling when

284
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
people because I'm not grappling when
 

285
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,830
people because I'm not grappling when
there's a that he has a weapon. He can

286
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
there's a that he has a weapon. He can
 

287
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,629
there's a that he has a weapon. He can
draw it in that tie up. Okay.

288
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
draw it in that tie up. Okay.
 

289

draw it in that tie up. Okay.
So,

290
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
So,
 

291
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,469
So,
in this case, he's passive and we're

292
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
in this case, he's passive and we're
 

293
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,350
in this case, he's passive and we're
usually non deadly. We'll do it slow

294
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
usually non deadly. We'll do it slow
 

295
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,710
usually non deadly. We'll do it slow
now. He's dancing around.

296
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
now. He's dancing around.

We can now kind of gather ourselves,
right? You feel some control over him.

You can talk to each other now, right?
You want to give him a command because

308

You want to give him a command because
 

309
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,990
You want to give him a command because
we have feasibility. Hey, we want you to

lay on your stomach. And as we're doing
that, we are going to take his balance

that, we are going to take his balance
 

315
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,110
that, we are going to take his balance
forward while holding him up because he

forward while holding him up because he
 

317
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,110
forward while holding him up because he
