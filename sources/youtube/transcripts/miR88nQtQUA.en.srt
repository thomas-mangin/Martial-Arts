1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,149

bag of sugar you can do

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,159
bag of sugar you can do
 

3
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,070
bag of sugar you can do
it's uh really a fallacy because

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
it's uh really a fallacy because
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,390
it's uh really a fallacy because
sometimes you just need sheer strength

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
sometimes you just need sheer strength
 

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,910
sometimes you just need sheer strength
now this is

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
now this is
 

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,030
now this is
to me

10
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
to me
 

11
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,070
to me
a technique

12
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
a technique
 

13
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,990
a technique
for women because if i do this and now

14
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
for women because if i do this and now
 

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,750
for women because if i do this and now
do this

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
do this
 

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,710
do this
the technique has to rub up

18
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
the technique has to rub up
 

19
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,470
the technique has to rub up
through my breastbone

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
through my breastbone
 

21
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,830
through my breastbone
all right

22
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
all right
 

23
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,790
all right
and that's

24
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
and that's
 

25
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,429
and that's
you know possibly rude for ladies to do

26
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
you know possibly rude for ladies to do
 

27
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,310
you know possibly rude for ladies to do
that so i mean i don't know you know but

28
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
that so i mean i don't know you know but
 

29
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,030
that so i mean i don't know you know but
so if i do this

30
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
so if i do this
 

31
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,950
so if i do this
i've got a chance now when you drop this

32
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
i've got a chance now when you drop this
 

33
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,549
i've got a chance now when you drop this
elbow and countering me and

34
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
elbow and countering me and
 

35
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,190
elbow and countering me and
punching me or whatever so it depends

36
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
punching me or whatever so it depends
 

37
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,750
punching me or whatever so it depends
how strong you are

38
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
how strong you are
 

39
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,990
how strong you are
you know so if you do it

40
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
you know so if you do it
 

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,270
you know so if you do it
yeah so

42
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
yeah so
 

43
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,189
yeah so
i'm just saying for women you know if

44
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
i'm just saying for women you know if
 

45
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,790
i'm just saying for women you know if
you take it off your

46
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
you take it off your
 

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,229
you take it off your
breast bone

48
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
breast bone
 

49
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,910
breast bone
now i should start it i can feel it

50
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
now i should start it i can feel it
 

51
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,069
now i should start it i can feel it
getting struck against me so i'm going

52
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
getting struck against me so i'm going
 

53
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,310
getting struck against me so i'm going
to get even stronger

54
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
to get even stronger
 

55
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,670
to get even stronger
right so so i'm afraid

56
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
right so so i'm afraid
 

57
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,630
right so so i'm afraid
to me it's not a

58
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
to me it's not a
 

59
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,270
to me it's not a
woman's technique

60
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
woman's technique
 

61
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,270
woman's technique
because it needs to be there so she

62
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
because it needs to be there so she
 

63
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,510
because it needs to be there so she
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't

64
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't
 

65
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,070
doesn't feel my strength she doesn't
feel my strength she feels it now when i

66
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
feel my strength she feels it now when i
 

67
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,030
feel my strength she feels it now when i
start returning

68
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
start returning
 

69
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,910
start returning
see

70
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
see
 

71
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,310
see
but here

72
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
but here
 

73
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,310
but here
see i can turn as much light as you can

74
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
see i can turn as much light as you can
 

75
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,830
see i can turn as much light as you can
go yeah oh i'm going to budge in the

76
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
go yeah oh i'm going to budge in the
 

77
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,710
go yeah oh i'm going to budge in the
face

78
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720

 

79
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,030

so

80
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040

 

81
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,590

because i'm old i'm not sure about the

82
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
because i'm old i'm not sure about the
 

83
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,910
because i'm old i'm not sure about the
gender neutral and all the other

84
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
gender neutral and all the other
 

85
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,149
gender neutral and all the other
technology words that we have to use now

86
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
technology words that we have to use now
 

87
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,749
technology words that we have to use now
i'm just saying it's not a great

88
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
i'm just saying it's not a great
 

89
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,830
i'm just saying it's not a great
technique for ladies because you've got

90
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
technique for ladies because you've got
 

91
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,350
technique for ladies because you've got
to use strength you know if you're

92
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
to use strength you know if you're
 

93
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,270
to use strength you know if you're
looking after your own body

94
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
looking after your own body
 

95
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,030
looking after your own body
you've got things

96
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
you've got things
 

97
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,350
you've got things
so this technique has to go

98
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
so this technique has to go
 

99
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,469
so this technique has to go
up the breastbone so

100
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479

 

101
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,950

so i was reading about oceansian when he

102
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
so i was reading about oceansian when he
 

103
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,870
so i was reading about oceansian when he
got a 70 there's a lot of techniques he

104
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
got a 70 there's a lot of techniques he
 

105
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,830
got a 70 there's a lot of techniques he
didn't do

106
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840

 

107
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,350

but if we do this one now i can get a

108
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
but if we do this one now i can get a
 

109
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,270
but if we do this one now i can get a
saying here

110
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
saying here
 

111
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,949
saying here
even that doesn't look like a sankhya

112
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
even that doesn't look like a sankhya
 

113
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,869
even that doesn't look like a sankhya
because i've got this arm lock that's it

114
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
because i've got this arm lock that's it
 

115
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,030
because i've got this arm lock that's it
tap tap tap on that so that's the main

116
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
tap tap tap on that so that's the main
 

117
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,390
tap tap tap on that so that's the main
thing

118
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
thing
 

119
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:33,270
thing
so let's just

120
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280

 

121
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,710

and then when it gets about there see

122
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
and then when it gets about there see
 

123
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,110
and then when it gets about there see
this hand now is coming to me so that

124
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
this hand now is coming to me so that
 

125
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,070
this hand now is coming to me so that
she doesn't get away from me now

126
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080

 

127
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,869

this can be done without using strength

128
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
this can be done without using strength
 

129
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:55,509
this can be done without using strength
and you you find the mechanics

130
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519

 

131
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,519

very simple as you'll see we'll find out
