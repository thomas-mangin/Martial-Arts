says so
 

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,470
says so
i have to have the ground vector i'm not

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
i have to have the ground vector i'm not
 

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,069
i have to have the ground vector i'm not
going to

12
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
going to
 

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,190
going to
step with my line of gravity

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
step with my line of gravity
 

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,910
step with my line of gravity
between it's the same ground vector

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
between it's the same ground vector
 

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,630
between it's the same ground vector
you're always using

18
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
you're always using
 

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,830
you're always using
the same it's a it'll be a both your

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,830
the same it's a it'll be a both your
projection

22
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840

 

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,069

so don't bring your center gravity over

24
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
so don't bring your center gravity over
 

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,029
so don't bring your center gravity over
and fall down

26
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039

 

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,430

then don't stand on the tightrope your

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
then don't stand on the tightrope your
 

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,790
then don't stand on the tightrope your
feet will not be on the same type room

30
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
feet will not be on the same type room
 

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,630
feet will not be on the same type room
give some wick to your stance

32
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640

 

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,950

and then don't clear the elbow you're

34
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
and then don't clear the elbow you're
 

35
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,950
and then don't clear the elbow you're
opening up

36

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670

i'm going to check the other hand

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
i'm going to check the other hand
 

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:08,150
i'm going to check the other hand
because i moved to that side

54
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
because i moved to that side
 

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:23,510
because i moved to that side
come on

56
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
come on
 

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,550

is my opening

68
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
is my opening
 

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,830

no so he's doing yoga man
that's not my opening this is my opinion

74
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
that's not my opening this is my opinion
 

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,309
that's not my opening this is my opinion
so we're in here and he does that hook

76
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
so we're in here and he does that hook
 

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,270
so we're in here and he does that hook
that's my

78
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
that's my
 

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,869
that's my
bone

80
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879

 

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,110

so i do have my angle of deviation i'm

82
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
so i do have my angle of deviation i'm
 

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,509
so i do have my angle of deviation i'm
moving inside of it

84
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
moving inside of it
 

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,949
moving inside of it
but i'm not gonna move here

86
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
but i'm not gonna move here
 

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:16,830
but i'm not gonna move here
up and then hit my my opening already

88
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,990

happens

90
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
happens
 

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,630
happens
can add your eye slices so i'm going

92
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
can add your eye slices so i'm going
 

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,990
can add your eye slices so i'm going
this way with the eye slice

94
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
this way with the eye slice
 

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,110
this way with the eye slice
oh and i think so i get checked out

96
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
oh and i think so i get checked out
 

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,830
oh and i think so i get checked out
in here all right keep the check

98
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

99
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,990

here

100
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000

 

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:58,830

nice more deviation

102
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:13,270

okay

104
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280

 

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,830

drop your elbow you move off the circle

106
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
drop your elbow you move off the circle
 

107
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:31,830
drop your elbow you move off the circle
you're gonna move towards me

108
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840

 

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,430

okay so when i do this he goes oh

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
okay so when i do this he goes oh
 

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,430
okay so when i do this he goes oh
my back foot is the vector foot

112
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
my back foot is the vector foot
 

113
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,310
my back foot is the vector foot
so i'm not just hitting him so the back

114
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
so i'm not just hitting him so the back
 

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,710
so i'm not just hitting him so the back
foot

116
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
foot
 

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,629
foot
is vectoring so i can displace his mask

118
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
is vectoring so i can displace his mask
 

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,350

then
 

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,629
then
i'm sitting here i want him displaced so

124
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
i'm sitting here i want him displaced so
 

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:09,110
i'm sitting here i want him displaced so
we can

and the stick okay so right there
 

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,110

there's pressure you see the yard value

130
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
there's pressure you see the yard value
 

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,390
there's pressure you see the yard value
is changing

132
