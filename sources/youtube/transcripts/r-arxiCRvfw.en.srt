00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
when you're comfortable with this you
 

145
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,350
when you're comfortable with this you
can smooth out your movement

146
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
can smooth out your movement
 

147
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,589
can smooth out your movement
the last mode i'll show is anti-parallel

behind your back this time your arms

156
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
behind your back this time your arms
 

157
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,550
behind your back this time your arms
move in opposite directions

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
the coordination for this movement can
 

161
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,990
the coordination for this movement can
be challenging so break it down

162
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
be challenging so break it down
 

163
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,869
be challenging so break it down
into the four key points top and bottom

and practice slowly to ensure that you

174
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
and practice slowly to ensure that you
 

175
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,869
and practice slowly to ensure that you
have correct movement

176
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
have correct movement
 

177
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,150

once you're able to form these moves you
 

179
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,830
once you're able to form these moves you
can start linking them together each

experiment with the different modes and
 

199
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,910
experiment with the different modes and
have a go at joining the movements

200
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
have a go at joining the movements
 

201
