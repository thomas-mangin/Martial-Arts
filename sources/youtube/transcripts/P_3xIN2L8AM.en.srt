1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,790

okay the question is

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:03,800
okay the question is
 

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,070
okay the question is
[Music]

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
[Music]
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,830
[Music]
uh how do i am not pushing i'm not

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
uh how do i am not pushing i'm not
 

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,950
uh how do i am not pushing i'm not
fully um

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960

 

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,750

and let me add to the question

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
and let me add to the question
 

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,189
and let me add to the question
i think clothing dependent is also not

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
i think clothing dependent is also not
 

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,509
i think clothing dependent is also not
correct i think we do these things

14
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
correct i think we do these things
 

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,790
correct i think we do these things
because

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
because
 

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,150
because
we're missing key energetic

18
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
we're missing key energetic
 

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,150
we're missing key energetic
skills and i'll explain those in a

20
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
skills and i'll explain those in a
 

21
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,229
skills and i'll explain those in a
minute but

22
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
minute but
 

23
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,430
minute but
uh clothing dependency and then limb

24
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
uh clothing dependency and then limb
 

25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,310
uh clothing dependency and then limb
dependency

26
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
dependency
 

27
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,990
dependency
that's never a good thing so

28
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
that's never a good thing so
 

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,510
that's never a good thing so
we have a lot of turning like uh

30
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
we have a lot of turning like uh
 

31
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,869
we have a lot of turning like uh
grabbing cutting here and kind of

32
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
grabbing cutting here and kind of
 

33
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,630
grabbing cutting here and kind of
push full turn the guy

34
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640

 

35
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,470

we don't we don't want that okay

36
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
we don't we don't want that okay
 

37
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,510
we don't we don't want that okay
there are also clashes so

38
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
there are also clashes so
 

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,270
there are also clashes so
if i go here and i pull this guy

40
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
if i go here and i pull this guy
 

41
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,789
if i go here and i pull this guy
uh that's a clash he's going that way

42
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
uh that's a clash he's going that way
 

43
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,149
uh that's a clash he's going that way
and i'm trying to take him that way

44
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
and i'm trying to take him that way
 

45
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,190
and i'm trying to take him that way
that's a clash that's not the art

46
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
that's a clash that's not the art
 

47
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,070
that's a clash that's not the art
and secondly you're going to have to

48
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
and secondly you're going to have to
 

49
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,789
and secondly you're going to have to
have a choreographed 2k

50
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
have a choreographed 2k
 

51
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,310
have a choreographed 2k
so when i go like this and i pull the

52
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
so when i go like this and i pull the
 

53
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,109
so when i go like this and i pull the
guy

54
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
guy
 

55
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,749
guy
don't don't do anything and i pull him

56
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
don't don't do anything and i pull him
 

57
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,510
don't don't do anything and i pull him
he would fall like that

58
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
he would fall like that
 

59
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,030
he would fall like that
but every uk he'll turn

60
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
but every uk he'll turn
 

61
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,469
but every uk he'll turn
because he knows that's what he's

62
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
because he knows that's what he's
 

63
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,630
because he knows that's what he's
supposed to do and that's not

64
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
supposed to do and that's not
 

65
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,149
supposed to do and that's not
good either you have to

66
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
good either you have to
 

67
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,910
good either you have to
you have to think of the problem

68
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
you have to think of the problem
 

69
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,350
you have to think of the problem
differently

70
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
differently
 

71
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,350
differently
those questions are arising because

72
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
those questions are arising because
 

73
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,389
those questions are arising because
of how you're understanding the question

74
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
of how you're understanding the question
 

75
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,310
of how you're understanding the question
those questions cannot be answered

76
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
those questions cannot be answered
 

77
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,870
those questions cannot be answered
and be consistent with the art it's the

78
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
and be consistent with the art it's the
 

79
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,630
and be consistent with the art it's the
question itself is wrong

80
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
question itself is wrong
 

81
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,990
question itself is wrong
okay so the energy that you're looking

82
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
okay so the energy that you're looking
 

83
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,109
okay so the energy that you're looking
for

84
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119

from a linear entry
 

91
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,710
from a linear entry
you have to generate beforehand

92
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
you have to generate beforehand
 

93
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,990
you have to generate beforehand
the centrifugal energy so if this is

94
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
the centrifugal energy so if this is
 

95
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,190
the centrifugal energy so if this is
uh his head neck area

96
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
uh his head neck area
 

97
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,470
uh his head neck area
you're not pushing this like that

98
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
you're not pushing this like that
 

99
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,350
you're not pushing this like that
you're not pulling it like that this

100
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
you're not pulling it like that this
 

101
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,150
you're not pulling it like that this
ball is

102
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
ball is
 

103
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,710
ball is
traveling on a circle let's say it's

104
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
traveling on a circle let's say it's
 

105
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,390
traveling on a circle let's say it's
going that way

106
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
going that way
 

107
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,509
going that way
um and i'm going to come around and i

108
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
um and i'm going to come around and i
 

109
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,910
um and i'm going to come around and i
can without holding the ball

110
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
can without holding the ball
 

111
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,110
can without holding the ball
keep it in my control so

112
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120

 

113
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,430

i come around here you see i've changed

114
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
i come around here you see i've changed
 

115
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,430
i come around here you see i've changed
the x y already

116
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440

 

117
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,790

your question you didn't

118
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800

 

119
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,830

so from the get-go i changed it

120
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
so from the get-go i changed it
 

121
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,350
so from the get-go i changed it
and i now use that same ball technique

122
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
and i now use that same ball technique
 

123
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,630
and i now use that same ball technique
i don't want to go here he stopped

124
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
i don't want to go here he stopped
 

125
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,149
i don't want to go here he stopped
now there's no energy

126
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159

 

127
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,550

so his energy goes here and i keep that

128
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
so his energy goes here and i keep that
 

129
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,509
so his energy goes here and i keep that
thing going

130
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519

 

131
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,309

energy's going here and i'm in that

132
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
energy's going here and i'm in that
 

133
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,390
energy's going here and i'm in that
if you wait the energy stops and you're

134
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
if you wait the energy stops and you're
 

135
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,110
if you wait the energy stops and you're
back now in the other problem

136
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120

 

137
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,630

so his energy goes that way

138
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
so his energy goes that way
 

139
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,430
so his energy goes that way
and as soon as he moves there on here

140
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
and as soon as he moves there on here
 

141
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,750
and as soon as he moves there on here
and i'm already rotating

142
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760

 

143
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,830

not after too late it's not going to be

144
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

145
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,990

energetic

146
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
energetic
 

147
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,990
energetic
so in

148
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000

 

149
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750

and just like if i was doing it on the

150
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
and just like if i was doing it on the
 

151
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,110
and just like if i was doing it on the
ball

152
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
ball
 

153
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,830
ball
open your hand don't keep your hand here

154
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
open your hand don't keep your hand here
 

155
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,030
open your hand don't keep your hand here
i don't know which part i'm going to be

156
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
i don't know which part i'm going to be
 

157
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,229
i don't know which part i'm going to be
able to manipulate

158
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
able to manipulate
 

159
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,830
able to manipulate
energetically so open your heart

160
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
energetically so open your heart
 

161
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,550
energetically so open your heart
open your hand and be in a place

162
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
open your hand and be in a place
 

163
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,789
open your hand and be in a place
where the slack isn't taken out with the

164
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
where the slack isn't taken out with the
 

165
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,990
where the slack isn't taken out with the
turn of his head

166
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
turn of his head
 

167
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,150
turn of his head
so i go over here you're going to lose

168
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
so i go over here you're going to lose
 

169
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,469
so i go over here you're going to lose
it so i'm kind of

170
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
it so i'm kind of
 

171
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,590
it so i'm kind of
here on the neck mandible area

172
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600

179
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,189

and i'm doing it there again

180
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199

 

181
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,270

so he stands up and i'm here

182
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
so he stands up and i'm here
 

183
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,510
so he stands up and i'm here
doing the same kind of energetic

184
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
doing the same kind of energetic
 

185
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,189
doing the same kind of energetic

manipulation
 

187
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,830
manipulation
okay okay so he's going that way i'm

188
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
okay okay so he's going that way i'm
 

189
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,629
okay okay so he's going that way i'm
in

00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639

 

191
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,310

i'm not torquing him

192
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
i'm not torquing him
 

193
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,790
i'm not torquing him
controlling his head you know these are

194
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
controlling his head you know these are
 

195
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,749
controlling his head you know these are
all

set
 

201
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,590
set
you have to do this just like the key

202
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
you have to do this just like the key
 

203
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,870
you have to do this just like the key
grab all right

204
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
grab all right
 

205
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,430
grab all right
let's get to here same thing here

206
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
let's get to here same thing here
 

207
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,110
let's get to here same thing here
he gets up look what i'm using i'm using

208
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
he gets up look what i'm using i'm using
 

209
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,150
he gets up look what i'm using i'm using
my body as a lever

210
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
my body as a lever
 

211
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,670
my body as a lever
again an external solution

212
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
again an external solution
 

213
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,350
again an external solution
to a missing skill set so this energy

214
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
to a missing skill set so this energy
 

215
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,430
to a missing skill set so this energy
i'm bringing around this energy i'm

216
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
i'm bringing around this energy i'm
 

217
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,110
i'm bringing around this energy i'm
bringing up

218
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120

 

219
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,430

the problem with external solutions is i

220
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
the problem with external solutions is i
 

221
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,110
the problem with external solutions is i
have to be strong enough

222
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
have to be strong enough
 

223
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,110
have to be strong enough
i have to be stronger if i am going to

224
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
i have to be stronger if i am going to
 

225
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,390
i have to be stronger if i am going to
control his head

226
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
control his head
 

227
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,310
control his head
it requires that i'm actually strong

228
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
it requires that i'm actually strong
 

229
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,390
it requires that i'm actually strong
enough to control his head

230
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400

 

231
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,909

same thing here yes this this

232
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
same thing here yes this this
 

233
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,950
same thing here yes this this
body is a greater lever

234
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
body is a greater lever
 

235
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,309
body is a greater lever
than no energetic skill and trying to

236
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
than no energetic skill and trying to
 

237
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,350
than no energetic skill and trying to
use one hand

238
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
use one hand
 

239
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,710
use one hand
but you still have to be stronger than

240
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
but you still have to be stronger than
 

241
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,430
but you still have to be stronger than
the resistance you're trying to move

242
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440

 

243
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,909

we're doing something different here

244
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919

 

245
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,790

so pay attention hal i'll have to keep

246
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
so pay attention hal i'll have to keep
 

247
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,790
so pay attention hal i'll have to keep
him moving

248
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
him moving
 

249
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,830
him moving
go back to the first problem

250
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
go back to the first problem
 

251
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,469
go back to the first problem
this fight has to start rotating

252
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
this fight has to start rotating
 

253
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,790
this fight has to start rotating
you're like that's weird no you know

254
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
you're like that's weird no you know
 

255
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,150
you're like that's weird no you know
what's weird is the 12

256
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
what's weird is the 12
 

257
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,670
what's weird is the 12
6 line is weird that's a weird thing

258
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
6 line is weird that's a weird thing
 

259
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,469
6 line is weird that's a weird thing
okay there's many ways that you can

260
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
okay there's many ways that you can
 

261
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,270
okay there's many ways that you can
start

262
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
start
 

263
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,029
start
a fight rotating the first deviation

264
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
a fight rotating the first deviation
 

265
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,909
a fight rotating the first deviation
so he throws whatever boom he's going to

266
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
so he throws whatever boom he's going to
 

267
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,950
so he throws whatever boom he's going to
come at me again

268
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
come at me again
 

269
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,309
come at me again
isn't he a fight's rotating you see

270
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
isn't he a fight's rotating you see
 

271
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,430
isn't he a fight's rotating you see
so does it again he deviates we're

272
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
so does it again he deviates we're
 

273
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,790
so does it again he deviates we're
rotating now

274
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800

 

275
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,749

it's not uncommon what's uncommon he

276
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
it's not uncommon what's uncommon he
 

277
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,350
it's not uncommon what's uncommon he
throws the strike

278
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
throws the strike
 

279
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,110
throws the strike
this is uncommon

280
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120

 

281
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,110

fights rotate all the time this one is

282
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
fights rotate all the time this one is
 

283
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,629
fights rotate all the time this one is
aggression

284
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639

 

285
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,029

this is not a self-defense situation i'm

286
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
this is not a self-defense situation i'm
 

287
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,029
this is not a self-defense situation i'm
not doing a

288
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
not doing a
 

289
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,710
not doing a
wrist grab defense

290
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720

 

291
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,550

i'm understanding that

292
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560

 

293
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,950

so that i can understand this

294
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960

 

295
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,230

not here no this is

296
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
not here no this is
 

297
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,629
not here no this is
not external manipulation

298
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639

 

299
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,550

so he goes this way i go this way

300
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
so he goes this way i go this way
 

301
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,990
so he goes this way i go this way
oh and i do it again and you can see the

302
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
oh and i do it again and you can see the
 

303
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,029
oh and i do it again and you can see the
force that i can

304
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
force that i can
 

305
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,230
force that i can
generate by just using that same trick

306
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
generate by just using that same trick
 

307
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,869
generate by just using that same trick
on the

308
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
on the
 

309
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,629
on the
on the throw part right so here it comes

310
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
on the throw part right so here it comes
 

311
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:06,869
on the throw part right so here it comes
way boom without the grab

312
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879

 

313
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,869

right here you don't need to grab

314
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
right here you don't need to grab
 

315
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,390
right here you don't need to grab
his energy and the pattern all creates

316
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
his energy and the pattern all creates
 

317
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,830
his energy and the pattern all creates
the necessary friction the energetic

318
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
the necessary friction the energetic
 

319
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,589
the necessary friction the energetic
adhesion is as as he comes in

320
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
adhesion is as as he comes in
 

321
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,629
adhesion is as as he comes in
and he keeps moving that way i take

322
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
and he keeps moving that way i take
 

323
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,029
and he keeps moving that way i take
advantage of this circle

324
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039

 

325
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,149

so i don't stick a new linear line

326
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
so i don't stick a new linear line
 

327
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,149
so i don't stick a new linear line
into this and then reach

328
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
into this and then reach
 

329
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,829
into this and then reach
this is still

330
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
this is still
 

331
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,870
this is still
a clash

332
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880

 

333
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,310

so he starts the rotation and i keep the

334
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
so he starts the rotation and i keep the
 

335
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,509
so he starts the rotation and i keep the
rotation going

336
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519

 

337
00:08:51,519 --> 00:09:01,269

you have to change how you

338
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279

 

339
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,269

oh he goes here and i pass him

340
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279

 

341
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:15,910

here rotate rotate rotate

342
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920

 

343
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,150

he also as i said he has to keep moving

344
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
he also as i said he has to keep moving
 

345
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,350
he also as i said he has to keep moving
so if i don't keep the rotation going

346
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
so if i don't keep the rotation going
 

347
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,670
so if i don't keep the rotation going
i won't do it i'll be pushing and

348
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
i won't do it i'll be pushing and
 

349
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,590
i won't do it i'll be pushing and
pulling

350
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
pulling
 

351
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,910
pulling
but if i do keep if i do get the

352
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
but if i do keep if i do get the
 

353
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,829
but if i do keep if i do get the
rotational angle

354
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
rotational angle
 

355
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,509
rotational angle
and we stopped it's not it

356
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
and we stopped it's not it
 

357
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,790
and we stopped it's not it
so this is coming in

358
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
so this is coming in
 

359
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,590
so this is coming in
you have the first blend and you can use

360
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
you have the first blend and you can use
 

361
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,150
you have the first blend and you can use
this hand

362
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
this hand
 

363
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,790
this hand
with your adhesion on this side

364
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800

 

365
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,350

here i'm not cutting here on the inside

366
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
here i'm not cutting here on the inside
 

367
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,110
here i'm not cutting here on the inside
of his arm

368
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
of his arm
 

369
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,190
of his arm
this adhesion on this side

370
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200

 

371
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,269

it that is the tougher adhesion

372
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
it that is the tougher adhesion
 

373
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,440
it that is the tougher adhesion
but you see how it keeps it moving

374
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,450

 

375
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,870

[Music]

376
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880

 

377
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,310

so let's just do the first part he keeps

378
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
so let's just do the first part he keeps
 

379
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,030
so let's just do the first part he keeps
moving

380
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
moving
 

381
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:32,069
moving
keeps moving behind him

382
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
keeps moving behind him
 

383
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,590
keeps moving behind him
so let's say i jack up

384
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
so let's say i jack up
 

385
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,949
so let's say i jack up
i can't adhere here he's done

386
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
i can't adhere here he's done
 

387
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,269
i can't adhere here he's done
moving you can keep it going from here

388
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
moving you can keep it going from here
 

389
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,630
moving you can keep it going from here
in you see that's enough energy i did

390
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
in you see that's enough energy i did
 

391
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,310
in you see that's enough energy i did
not get any

392
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320

 

393
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,030

that's how important and how different

394
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
that's how important and how different
 

395
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,870
that's how important and how different
it is to go here

396
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
it is to go here
 

397
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,190
it is to go here
and then do a head control

398
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200

 

399
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,030

he has to keep moving

400
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040

 

401
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,069

keeps moving

402
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079

 

403
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,590

keeps moving

404
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600

 

405
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,269

so if you look my mind is different

406
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
so if you look my mind is different
 

407
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,470
so if you look my mind is different
i want him to keep going forward i don't

408
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
i want him to keep going forward i don't
 

409
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,150
i want him to keep going forward i don't
want him to go backwards

410
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
want him to go backwards
 

411
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,430
want him to go backwards
i don't want him to tilt

412
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440

 

413
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:36,470

he's here keeps going

414
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480

 

415
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,590

okay uh the prescription is um

416
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
okay uh the prescription is um
 

417
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,949
okay uh the prescription is um
this technique is a spinal displacement

418
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
this technique is a spinal displacement
 

419
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,630
this technique is a spinal displacement
okay so i'm not here holding his wrist

420
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
okay so i'm not here holding his wrist
 

421
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,230
okay so i'm not here holding his wrist
um there's a linear aggression to it

422
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
um there's a linear aggression to it
 

423
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,470
um there's a linear aggression to it
and it's again coming from the same

424
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
and it's again coming from the same
 

425
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,949
and it's again coming from the same
internal skills that he's using as

426
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
internal skills that he's using as
 

427
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,470
internal skills that he's using as
as uh nagi so i'm here

428
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
as uh nagi so i'm here
 

429
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,350
as uh nagi so i'm here
and i'm able to move him by projecting

430
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
and i'm able to move him by projecting
 

431
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,269
and i'm able to move him by projecting
his center

432
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
his center
 

433
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,829
his center
so to do that i'm not pinning myself

434
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
so to do that i'm not pinning myself
 

435
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,269
so to do that i'm not pinning myself
it's not this

436
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279

 

437
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,550

i i am i am as mobile as as

438
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
i i am i am as mobile as as
 

439
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,990
i i am i am as mobile as as
anything so um to stand up i would have

440
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
anything so um to stand up i would have
 

441
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,030
anything so um to stand up i would have
to put my weight

442
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
to put my weight
 

443
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,069
to put my weight
on the balls of my feet and uh that's

444
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
on the balls of my feet and uh that's
 

445
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,710
on the balls of my feet and uh that's
the same ground vectors not my knees

446
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
the same ground vectors not my knees
 

447
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,509
the same ground vectors not my knees
it's the same ground vector up here so

448
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
it's the same ground vector up here so
 

449
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,870
it's the same ground vector up here so
you can stand up

450
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
you can stand up
 

451
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,150
you can stand up
and and move can you see that

452
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
and and move can you see that
 

453
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,750
and and move can you see that
i'm not i'm not in mobile okay so

454
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
i'm not i'm not in mobile okay so
 

455
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,949
i'm not i'm not in mobile okay so
uh when he

456
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
uh when he
 

457
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,110
uh when he
creates what you think is a void

458
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
creates what you think is a void
 

459
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,269
creates what you think is a void
if i wasn't doing the bracing angle he

460
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
if i wasn't doing the bracing angle he
 

461
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,269
if i wasn't doing the bracing angle he
goes with the void abrasion angle i do

462
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
goes with the void abrasion angle i do
 

463
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,030
goes with the void abrasion angle i do
that and i lose my grip

464
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040

 

465
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,509

but if i was doing the same ground

466
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
but if i was doing the same ground
 

467
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,350
but if i was doing the same ground
vectoring

468
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
vectoring
 

469
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,990
vectoring
when i pushed in there he creates the

470
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
when i pushed in there he creates the
 

471
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,350
when i pushed in there he creates the
void i would move in

472
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
void i would move in
 

473
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,110
void i would move in
my whole body would move it

474
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120

 

475
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,030

and that doesn't change when i get on

476
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
and that doesn't change when i get on
 

477
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,030
and that doesn't change when i get on
the ground azuki

478
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
the ground azuki
 

479
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,350
the ground azuki
so is he i'm trying to push he's

480
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
so is he i'm trying to push he's
 

481
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,750
so is he i'm trying to push he's
reconciling my whole body with movement

482
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760

 

483
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,069

that's what you're seeing him do he's

484
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
that's what you're seeing him do he's
 

485
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,430
that's what you're seeing him do he's
not leaning out there

486
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
not leaning out there
 

487
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,110
not leaning out there
and then he's doing that that kind of

488
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
and then he's doing that that kind of
 

489
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,470
and then he's doing that that kind of
thing saying he's not doing the

490
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
thing saying he's not doing the
 

491
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,150
thing saying he's not doing the
prescribed attack

492
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
prescribed attack
 

493
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,509
prescribed attack
so let's try to have that

494
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
so let's try to have that
 

495
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,069
so let's try to have that
uke fix that the second thing

496
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
uke fix that the second thing
 

497
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,269
uke fix that the second thing
is he has to keep moving

498
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
is he has to keep moving
 

499
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,910
is he has to keep moving
some mukesh can't do that they're not

500
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
some mukesh can't do that they're not
 

501
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,069
some mukesh can't do that they're not
mobile enough

502
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
mobile enough
 

503
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,790
mobile enough
but you can keep moving him with this

504
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
but you can keep moving him with this
 

505
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,829
but you can keep moving him with this
adhesion here

506
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839

 

507
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,069

okay it is a harder adhesion than the

508
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
okay it is a harder adhesion than the
 

509
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,230
okay it is a harder adhesion than the
one using centrifugal energy

510
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
one using centrifugal energy
 

511
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,629
one using centrifugal energy
it works on the same principle but it's

512
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
it works on the same principle but it's
 

513
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,990
it works on the same principle but it's
not using

514
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
not using
 

515
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,430
not using
the same energy sources

516
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
the same energy sources
 

517
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,710
the same energy sources
okay

518
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720

 

519
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,829

if it does stop when i come here

520
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
if it does stop when i come here
 

521
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,949
if it does stop when i come here
it's the same same thing from here i can

522
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
it's the same same thing from here i can
 

523
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,389
it's the same same thing from here i can
move his center

524
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399

 

525
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,310

so in the same way that i'm moving his

526
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
so in the same way that i'm moving his
 

527
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,670
so in the same way that i'm moving his
center there

528
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
center there
 

529
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,750
center there
on the void i'm not just getting out of

530
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
on the void i'm not just getting out of
 

531
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,990
on the void i'm not just getting out of
the way and he falls into it

532
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
the way and he falls into it
 

533
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,430
the way and he falls into it
there is an acceleration

534
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
there is an acceleration
 

535
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,750
there is an acceleration
and the same way that this is just an

536
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
and the same way that this is just an
 

537
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,030
and the same way that this is just an
arm move

538
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
arm move
 

539
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,750
arm move
it keeps that center going room this

540
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
it keeps that center going room this
 

541
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,150
it keeps that center going room this
energy is going

542
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
energy is going
 

543
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,509
energy is going
it's the same thing if i have to when i

544
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
it's the same thing if i have to when i
 

545
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:29,990
it's the same thing if i have to when i
get here

546
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
get here
 

547
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,670
get here
the action stop don't push into

548
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
the action stop don't push into
 

549
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,509
the action stop don't push into
his head and arm push into his

550
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
his head and arm push into his
 

551
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,470
his head and arm push into his
center to keep it going

552
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480

 

553
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,269

that way i'll have a chance if this

554
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
that way i'll have a chance if this
 

555
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,110
that way i'll have a chance if this
thing slows down

556
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
thing slows down
 

557
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,470
thing slows down
that i can still do the correct

558
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
that i can still do the correct
 

559
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,509
that i can still do the correct
uh initial rotational geometry and

560
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
uh initial rotational geometry and
 

561
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,189
uh initial rotational geometry and
generate the adhesion

562
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
generate the adhesion
 

563
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,350
generate the adhesion
through centripetal centrifugal energies

564
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
through centripetal centrifugal energies
 

565
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,470
through centripetal centrifugal energies
okay

566
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
okay
 

567
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,710
okay
now this check

568
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
now this check
 

569
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,910
now this check
this arm thing that you're doing is so

570
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
this arm thing that you're doing is so
 

571
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,430
this arm thing that you're doing is so
common

so if he had a knife i'm checking his

586
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
so if he had a knife i'm checking his
 

587

at his elbow he's trying to stab me it's
 

589
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,870
at his elbow he's trying to stab me it's
hard for him to

590
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
hard for him to
 

591
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,030
hard for him to
find different angles because i can keep

if i'm on the inside like this it's hard

596
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
if i'm on the inside like this it's hard
 

597
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,590
if i'm on the inside like this it's hard
for me to control what that knife is

598
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
for me to control what that knife is
 

599

you're on the outside of the elbow
 

605
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,790
you're on the outside of the elbow
number on top never on the inside

607
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,670

and hence it's not part of the kazushi

608
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
and hence it's not part of the kazushi
 

609
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,189
and hence it's not part of the kazushi
i'm not going like

610
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
i'm not going like
 

611
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,870
i'm not going like
this

612
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880

 

613
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,710

the energy is keeping them going forward

614
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
the energy is keeping them going forward
 

615
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,790
the energy is keeping them going forward
and in that end is the outward

and in that end is the outward
 

617
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,430
and in that end is the outward
that i'm using on this adhesion

618

619
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,590

again if i don't have the energetic

620
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
again if i don't have the energetic
 

621
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,590
again if i don't have the energetic
principles i got to come up with some

622
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
principles i got to come up with some
 

623
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,069
principles i got to come up with some
external inferior thing

624
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
external inferior thing
 

625
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,430
external inferior thing
but to stop to gain the internal

626
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
but to stop to gain the internal
 

627
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,910
but to stop to gain the internal
i got to stop the external i got to stop

628
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
i got to stop the external i got to stop
 

629
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,189
i got to stop the external i got to stop
it so i'm going to put my hand on the

630
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
it so i'm going to put my hand on the
 

631
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,470
it so i'm going to put my hand on the
outside

outside
 

633
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,670
outside
it's on the outside of the elbow i keep

634
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
it's on the outside of the elbow i keep
 

635
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,670
it's on the outside of the elbow i keep
this going

636
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
this going
 

637
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,629
this going
and start

638
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639

 

639
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,910

outside keep it there it stopped

640
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
outside keep it there it stopped
 

641
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:52,150
outside keep it there it stopped
i'll have to get it going again

642
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160

 

643
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:11,189

in push it in

644
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199

 

645
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
