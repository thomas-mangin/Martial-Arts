160
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,610
tucked his chin and he rolled and
 

161
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,730
tucked his chin and he rolled and
distributed the way in in a rolling

162
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:57,740
distributed the way in in a rolling
 

163
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,140
distributed the way in in a rolling
action whether he actually does a roll

164
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,150
action whether he actually does a roll
 

165
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,090
action whether he actually does a roll
or not that kind of action distributes

166
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,100
or not that kind of action distributes
 

167
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,770
or not that kind of action distributes
that force a little better and no one

168
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:02,780
that force a little better and no one
 

169
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,380
that force a little better and no one
part of his body takes too much force so

170
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,390
part of his body takes too much force so
 

171
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,420
part of his body takes too much force so
that's a really great way to fall okay

172
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,430
that's a really great way to fall okay
 

173
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,720
that's a really great way to fall okay
now if I had Josh in a position like

174
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:10,730
now if I had Josh in a position like
 

175
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,570
now if I had Josh in a position like
this okay it's impossible for him to

176
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:13,580
this okay it's impossible for him to
 

177
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,920
this okay it's impossible for him to
stick his arm down because I'm holding

178
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:14,930
stick his arm down because I'm holding
 

179
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,930
stick his arm down because I'm holding
it so if I'm pushing him this way he

180
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:16,940
it so if I'm pushing him this way he
 

181
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,180
it so if I'm pushing him this way he
can't stick his arm down okay it's also

182
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,190
can't stick his arm down okay it's also
 

183
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,100
can't stick his arm down okay it's also
possible for him to fall rounding his

184
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,110
possible for him to fall rounding his
 

185
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,720
possible for him to fall rounding his
spine so if he did a side break fall

186
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,730
spine so if he did a side break fall
 

187
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,430
spine so if he did a side break fall
like this by shoved him he kind of just

188
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
like this by shoved him he kind of just
 

189
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,750
like this by shoved him he kind of just
side break also it'd be a side great

190
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
side break also it'd be a side great
 

191
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,100
side break also it'd be a side great
fall that would be cool and that would

192
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,110
fall that would be cool and that would
 

193
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,990
fall that would be cool and that would
be a good way to fall but because I'm

194
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
be a good way to fall but because I'm
 

195
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,090
be a good way to fall but because I'm
holding him he can't do that so it

196
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,100
holding him he can't do that so it
 

197
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,130
holding him he can't do that so it
really means when he falls very likely

198
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,140
really means when he falls very likely
 

199
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,600
really means when he falls very likely
he's gonna smash directly into his

200
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,610
he's gonna smash directly into his
 

201
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,400
he's gonna smash directly into his
shoulder or directly in his head so I'm

202
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,410
shoulder or directly in his head so I'm
 

203
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,230
shoulder or directly in his head so I'm
pushing at the ground like that that's

204
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,240
pushing at the ground like that that's
 

205
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,490
pushing at the ground like that that's
where he's gonna fall that's right there

206
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:39,500
where he's gonna fall that's right there
 

207
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,780
where he's gonna fall that's right there
on his head or his shoulder so he

208
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:40,790
on his head or his shoulder so he
 

209
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,130
on his head or his shoulder so he
doesn't want to do that so what Josh

210
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,140
doesn't want to do that so what Josh
 

211
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,200
doesn't want to do that so what Josh
does is allows his body to come all the

212
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,210
does is allows his body to come all the
 

213
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,110
does is allows his body to come all the
way over and hit on the other side just

214
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
way over and hit on the other side just
 

215
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,970
way over and hit on the other side just
like that now when he falls like that he

216
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:48,980
like that now when he falls like that he
 

217
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,010
like that now when he falls like that he
can distribute his way evenly on the

218
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,020
can distribute his way evenly on the
 

219
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,350
can distribute his way evenly on the
opposite side of his body so basically

220
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
opposite side of his body so basically
 

221
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
opposite side of his body so basically
what happened was I put him in a

222
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,410
what happened was I put him in a
 

223
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,500
what happened was I put him in a
precarious position where following

224
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,510
precarious position where following
 

225
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,850
precarious position where following
means he would have smashed his shoulder

226
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:57,860
means he would have smashed his shoulder
 

227
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,560
means he would have smashed his shoulder
really hard or smashed his head so

228
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,570
really hard or smashed his head so
 

229
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,510
really hard or smashed his head so
instead of doing that Josh chooses to

230
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:01,520
instead of doing that Josh chooses to
 

231
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,940
instead of doing that Josh chooses to
jump over and land on the other side of

232
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:03,950
jump over and land on the other side of
 

233
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,040
jump over and land on the other side of
his body now this looks phenomenal right

234
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,050
his body now this looks phenomenal right
 

235
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,600
his body now this looks phenomenal right
and so probably due to a lot of

236
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,610
and so probably due to a lot of
 

237
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,790
and so probably due to a lot of
popularity of Aikido is because everyone

238
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:09,800
popularity of Aikido is because everyone
 

239
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
popularity of Aikido is because everyone
thinks that Aikido masters are so great

240
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:11,510
thinks that Aikido masters are so great
 

241
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,090
thinks that Aikido masters are so great
and they can throw so hard but when you

242
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,100
and they can throw so hard but when you
 

243
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,860
and they can throw so hard but when you
see that you shouldn't be complementing

244
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:14,870
see that you shouldn't be complementing
 

245
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,780
see that you shouldn't be complementing
the Aikido expert you should be

246
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:16,790
the Aikido expert you should be
 

247
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,699
the Aikido expert you should be
complimenting the guy who's falling

248
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:18,709
complimenting the guy who's falling
 

249
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,810
complimenting the guy who's falling
because you guys falling

250
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:19,820
because you guys falling
 

251
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,340
because you guys falling
actually knows how to fall in a way to

252
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,350
actually knows how to fall in a way to
 

253
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,840
actually knows how to fall in a way to
keep himself from getting hurt when he's

254
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:22,850
keep himself from getting hurt when he's
 

255
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,350
keep himself from getting hurt when he's
being pushed

256
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
being pushed
 

257
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,420
being pushed
into a precarious position so the

258
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,430
into a precarious position so the
 

259
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,100
into a precarious position so the
position is being pushed into is

260
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,110
position is being pushed into is
 

261
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,749
position is being pushed into is
dangerous for him but it's not because

262
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:28,759
dangerous for him but it's not because
 

263
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,700
dangerous for him but it's not because
the Aikido nage the person doing the

264
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:30,710
the Aikido nage the person doing the
 

265
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,320
the Aikido nage the person doing the
throwing is throwing so forcefully that

266
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,330
throwing is throwing so forcefully that
 

267
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,879
throwing is throwing so forcefully that
happens the guy who's being thrown

268
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:33,889
happens the guy who's being thrown
 

269
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,490
happens the guy who's being thrown
chooses to jump over so that way he can

270
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,500
chooses to jump over so that way he can
 

271
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,529
chooses to jump over so that way he can
distribute his weight better so this is

272
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:38,539
distribute his weight better so this is
 

273
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,149
distribute his weight better so this is
a breaking up a little bit of the myth

274
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:40,159
a breaking up a little bit of the myth
 

275
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,830
