00:22:35,950 --> 00:23:02,710

of the two other groups there's no push

336
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
of the two other groups there's no push
 

337
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:15,820
of the two other groups there's no push
your inside legs out

338
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:15,830

 

339
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:23,490

holy

340
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:23,500

 

341
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,030

but thank you for sure
