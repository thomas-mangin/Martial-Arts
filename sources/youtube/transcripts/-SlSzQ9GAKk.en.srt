1
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,340

so

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,350

 

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:43,350

[Music]

4
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360

 

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,510

uh what version is this

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520

 

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,910

okay

8
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920

 

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,750

um

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760

 

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,189

when do i

12
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
when do i
 

13
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,189
when do i
enter

14
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
enter
 

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,229
enter
in terms of yin and yang theory

16
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239

 

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,429

when there's a yin space okay

18
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
when there's a yin space okay
 

19
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,950
when there's a yin space okay
so

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
so
 

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,630
so
there's a couple things you can see

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
there's a couple things you can see
 

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,710
there's a couple things you can see
at some point

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
at some point
 

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,070
at some point
i'm going to enter

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080

 

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,670

he could do that with a pull go ahead

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680

 

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,830

but now i have a problem because at some

30
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
but now i have a problem because at some
 

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,230
but now i have a problem because at some
point i'm going to turn

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
point i'm going to turn
 

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,230
point i'm going to turn
and when do i turn

34
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
and when do i turn
 

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,190
and when do i turn
he pushes him when he's pushing okay

36
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
he pushes him when he's pushing okay
 

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,109
he pushes him when he's pushing okay
that he needs yarn for me again

38
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119

 

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,270

also there's a problem with the pull

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
also there's a problem with the pull
 

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,950
also there's a problem with the pull
because it's

42
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
because it's
 

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,990
because it's
representative of social violence not a

44
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
representative of social violence not a
 

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,670
representative of social violence not a
social violence because there's no

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
social violence because there's no
 

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,429
social violence because there's no
territoriality no spinal displacement

48
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
territoriality no spinal displacement
 

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,830
territoriality no spinal displacement
and so it is a what if

50
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
and so it is a what if
 

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,910
and so it is a what if
this is not kihon wasn't

52
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
this is not kihon wasn't
 

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,510
this is not kihon wasn't
okay

54
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520

 

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,190

so the idea that he's just staying there

56
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
so the idea that he's just staying there
 

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,630
so the idea that he's just staying there
and i go around is equally wrong because

58
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
and i go around is equally wrong because
 

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,309
and i go around is equally wrong because
he has no

60
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
he has no
 

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,190
he has no
spinal displacement okay

62
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
spinal displacement okay
 

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,190
spinal displacement okay
so in other words if he gives me the

64
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
so in other words if he gives me the
 

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,589
so in other words if he gives me the
spinal displacement

66
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
spinal displacement
 

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,270
spinal displacement
i can't enter

68
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
i can't enter
 

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,070
i can't enter
because that's young young

70
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
because that's young young
 

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,670
because that's young young
do you understand that

72
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
do you understand that
 

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,190
do you understand that
okay

74
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
okay
 

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,510
okay
so what there is initially is this faith

76
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
so what there is initially is this faith
 

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,830
so what there is initially is this faith
to his young to his

78
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
to his young to his
 

79
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,470
to his young to his
spinal displacement

80
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480

 

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,589

i take it around

82
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599

 

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:53,910

and then he hits the ground

84
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920

 

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,350

to do that

86
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
to do that
 

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,509
to do that
you can't go around him

88
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
you can't go around him
 

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,990
you can't go around him
and try to get his elbow and his wrist

90
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
and try to get his elbow and his wrist
 

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,830
and try to get his elbow and his wrist
in different planes

92
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
in different planes
 

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,630
in different planes
because the elbow keeps going

94
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
because the elbow keeps going
 

95
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,949
because the elbow keeps going
unless you get turns for you

96
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959

 

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,149

or

98
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
or
 

99
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,030
or
you yawn the elbow

100
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040

 

101
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:45,110

it's just big man i told

102
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120

 

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:57,910

little by little

104
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920

 

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,589

i'm not pushing down

106
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
i'm not pushing down
 

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,990
i'm not pushing down
he's falling and i'm staying in the

108
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
he's falling and i'm staying in the
 

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,910
he's falling and i'm staying in the
check-in position

110
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
check-in position
 

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:33,749
check-in position
it's staying even with him

112
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

113
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:42,550

so

114
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560

 

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,870

it looks like i'm

116
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
it looks like i'm
 

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,270
it looks like i'm
entering against him it's just i don't

118
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
entering against him it's just i don't
 

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590
entering against him it's just i don't
have the gap on the projection

120
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
have the gap on the projection
 

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,990
have the gap on the projection
so as soon as he comes off me boom i'm

122
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so as soon as he comes off me boom i'm
 

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,230
so as soon as he comes off me boom i'm
injured already

124
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
injured already
 

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,629
injured already
i'm not throwing him

126
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
i'm not throwing him
 

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:14,790
i'm not throwing him
and then

128
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800

 

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,670

you have to reconcile yin and yang

130
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
you have to reconcile yin and yang
 

131
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,830
you have to reconcile yin and yang
okay

132
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
okay
 

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,629
okay
more on yin and yang let's ask a

134
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
more on yin and yang let's ask a
 

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,710
more on yin and yang let's ask a
question at

136
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
question at
 

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,909
question at
this point

138
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
this point
 

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,070
this point
clearly the elbow handle

140
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
clearly the elbow handle
 

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,870
clearly the elbow handle
takes over

142
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880

 

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,670

clearly the elbow hand at that point is

144
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
clearly the elbow hand at that point is
 

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,590
clearly the elbow hand at that point is
young

146
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
young
 

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,670
young
which means up to that point it had to

148
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
which means up to that point it had to
 

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,150
which means up to that point it had to
have been one yeah it had to have been

150
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
have been one yeah it had to have been
 

151
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,870
have been one yeah it had to have been
yet so i'm not going like this

152
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
yet so i'm not going like this
 

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,070
yet so i'm not going like this
it's shut

154
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
it's shut
 

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,830
it's shut
the elbow

156
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
the elbow
 

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:06:01,760
the elbow
the call q is in this hand

158
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:01,770

 

159
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,550

[Music]

160
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
[Music]
 

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,469
[Music]
which means it went to you

162
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
which means it went to you
 

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,790
which means it went to you
which is why the other hand kicks up

164
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
which is why the other hand kicks up
 

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,029
which is why the other hand kicks up
beyond

166
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
beyond
 

167
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,150
beyond
so

168
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
so
 

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,029
so
don't shut this elbow down

170
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
don't shut this elbow down
 

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,309
don't shut this elbow down
violation

172
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
violation
 

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,790
violation
you go on the other way

174
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
you go on the other way
 

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:29,350
you go on the other way
then

176
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360

 

177
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,590

it's just in place

178
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
it's just in place
 

179
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,510
it's just in place
not doing anything

180
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
not doing anything
 

181
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,749
not doing anything
just in place

182
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
just in place
 

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:46,950
just in place
then

184
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960

 

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:07:10,629

down there it is

186
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639

 

187
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,270

again it looks like i hit him but if

188
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
again it looks like i hit him but if

your yin and yang are off

190
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
your yin and yang are off
 

191
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,510
your yin and yang are off
it's just

192
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
it's just
 

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,150
it's just
big man aikido which is not aikido it's

194
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
big man aikido which is not aikido it's
 

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,909
big man aikido which is not aikido it's
just you overpowering something

196
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919

 

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,230

when you do a keyhole waza

198
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
when you do a keyhole waza
 

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,350
when you do a keyhole waza
you want to do the body mechanics

200
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
you want to do the body mechanics
 

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,309
you want to do the body mechanics
of that keep on lesson

202
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
of that keep on lesson
 

203
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,029
of that keep on lesson
once you have internal skills

204
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
once you have internal skills
 

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,189
once you have internal skills
you don't need the body mechanics so

206
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
you don't need the body mechanics so
 

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,790
you don't need the body mechanics so
eventually you want to transcend the

208
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
eventually you want to transcend the
 

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,510
eventually you want to transcend the
body mechanics find the same technique

210
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
body mechanics find the same technique
 

211
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,070
body mechanics find the same technique
with different body mechanics that are

212
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
with different body mechanics that are
 

213
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,510
with different body mechanics that are
energetic okay so for example

214
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
energetic okay so for example
 

215
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,749
energetic okay so for example
here i take his wrist and elbow in a

216
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
here i take his wrist and elbow in a
 

217
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,909
here i take his wrist and elbow in a
different plane do you see that but from

218
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
different plane do you see that but from
 

219
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,150
different plane do you see that but from
here you can still find that same center

220
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
here you can still find that same center
 

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,790
here you can still find that same center
you see that i'm not passing his elbow

222
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
you see that i'm not passing his elbow
 

223
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,270
you see that i'm not passing his elbow
you see so i'm over here but it's still

224
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
you see so i'm over here but it's still
 

225
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,950
you see so i'm over here but it's still
in the center as i'm going do you

226
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
in the center as i'm going do you
 

227
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,309
in the center as i'm going do you
understand that

228
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319

 

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,029

when we do this move

230
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
when we do this move
 

231
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,749
when we do this move
it's mechanically

232
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
it's mechanically

236
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
you make this big circle
 

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,749
you make this big circle
it looks like it works it doesn't work

238
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
it looks like it works it doesn't work
 

239

it looks like it works it doesn't work
small muscle group

240
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
small muscle group
 

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,510
small muscle group
it also exposes the side of your body

242
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
it also exposes the side of your body
 

243
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,309

okay
so

248
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
so
 

249
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,589
so
this time is not making that circle that

250
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
this time is not making that circle that
 

251
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,469
this time is not making that circle that
you think it's making
