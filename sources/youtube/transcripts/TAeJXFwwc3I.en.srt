00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
he's coming in whoa i hit
 

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,950
he's coming in whoa i hit
there and you can see the tilt already

178
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
there and you can see the tilt already
 

179
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,390
there and you can see the tilt already
so boom tilt and it's not a smash

180
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
so boom tilt and it's not a smash
 

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,870
so boom tilt and it's not a smash
because as i feel the resistance of his

182
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
because as i feel the resistance of his
 

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,589
because as i feel the resistance of his
body

184
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
body
 

185
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,950
body
i'm going to tencon around it

186
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
i'm going to tencon around it
 

187
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,430
i'm going to tencon around it
then i'm down it'll turn his face

188
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
then i'm down it'll turn his face
 

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,469
then i'm down it'll turn his face
and that's what i shove down so all that

190
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
and that's what i shove down so all that
 

191
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:10,950
and that's what i shove down so all that
hit

192
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
hit
 

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,430
hit
here you're going to feel the resistance

194
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
here you're going to feel the resistance
 

195
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,110
here you're going to feel the resistance
of his mask and you yield

196
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
of his mask and you yield
 

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,430
of his mask and you yield
by going around it you're now on the

198
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
by going around it you're now on the
 

199
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,150
by going around it you're now on the
side of this

200
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
side of this
 

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,589
side of this
head and that's what i pull

202
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
head and that's what i pull
 

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,469
head and that's what i pull
and keep in that position pattern which

204
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
and keep in that position pattern which
 

205
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,029
and keep in that position pattern which
is the tilting of his body

206
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
is the tilting of his body
 

207
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,790
is the tilting of his body
pull here around him there's the tilt

208
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
pull here around him there's the tilt
 

209
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,510
pull here around him there's the tilt
stay there it's here you see like cookie

210
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
stay there it's here you see like cookie

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,270
home
but you're here like this oh

214
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
but you're here like this oh
 

215
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,870
but you're here like this oh
okay so try to remember you only have an

216
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
okay so try to remember you only have an
 

217
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,070
okay so try to remember you only have an
emery spiral

218
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
emery spiral
 

219
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,390
emery spiral
and then you only have this inverse this

220
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
and then you only have this inverse this
 

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,070
and then you only have this inverse this
is the outer spiral those are your only

222
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
is the outer spiral those are your only
 

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,350
is the outer spiral those are your only
two arm movements

224
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
two arm movements
 

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,710
two arm movements
in your aikido and the inner spiral is

226
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
in your aikido and the inner spiral is
 

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,510
in your aikido and the inner spiral is
going to require that my wrist and elbow

228
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
going to require that my wrist and elbow
 

229
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,189
going to require that my wrist and elbow
move through the

230
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
move through the
 

231
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,230
move through the
yin and yang phases of my body so if my

232
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
yin and yang phases of my body so if my
 

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,990
yin and yang phases of my body so if my
elbow is starting at the

234
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
elbow is starting at the
 

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,110
elbow is starting at the
yang line and it's going to move in

236
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
yang line and it's going to move in
 

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,309
yang line and it's going to move in
until my elbow is at least at the in

238
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
until my elbow is at least at the in
 

239
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,110
until my elbow is at least at the in
line if not to the transition line

240
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
line if not to the transition line
 

241
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,710
line if not to the transition line
between the ending on my

242
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
between the ending on my
 

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,070
between the ending on my
spine line okay so as you're going with

244
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
spine line okay so as you're going with
 

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,350
spine line okay so as you're going with
the technique we'll just do the

246
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
the technique we'll just do the
 

247
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,550
the technique we'll just do the
technique here

248
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
technique here
 

249
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,350
technique here
i don't want to bring my elbow here my

250
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
i don't want to bring my elbow here my
 

251
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,070
i don't want to bring my elbow here my
elbow is staying on the young line where

252
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
elbow is staying on the young line where
 

253
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,070
elbow is staying on the young line where
that where it came from so there's no

254
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
that where it came from so there's no
 

255
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,510
that where it came from so there's no
effect so

256
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
effect so
 

257
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,029
effect so
this hand has to move so that the elbow

258
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
this hand has to move so that the elbow
 

259
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,070
this hand has to move so that the elbow
is coming

260
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
is coming
 

261
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,509
is coming
towards that transition line of my spine

262
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
towards that transition line of my spine
 

263
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,990
towards that transition line of my spine
how then does it do the movement because

264
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
how then does it do the movement because
 

265
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,709
how then does it do the movement because
i'm not

266
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
i'm not
 

267
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,750
i'm not
here i'm moving around do you see

268
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760

 

269
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,829

so the technique is the same movement of

270
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
so the technique is the same movement of
 

271
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,870
so the technique is the same movement of
edema

272
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
edema
 

273
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,949
edema
but i'm not maintaining that same

274
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
but i'm not maintaining that same
 

275
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,310
but i'm not maintaining that same
relationship

276
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
relationship
 

277
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,430
relationship
so with my arm i'm moving around it's

278
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
so with my arm i'm moving around it's
 

279
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
so with my arm i'm moving around it's
doing the same spiral

280
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
doing the same spiral
 

281
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:15,190
doing the same spiral
same inward

282
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200

 

283
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,870

moving around

284
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
moving around
 

285
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,750
moving around
i'm not going to go around him but it's

286
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
i'm not going to go around him but it's
 

287
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,790
i'm not going to go around him but it's
going to go in

288
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
going to go in
 

289
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,910
going to go in
not bend here so the elbow stays with my

290
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
not bend here so the elbow stays with my
 

291
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,790
not bend here so the elbow stays with my
yarn line

292
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
yarn line
 

293
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,910
yarn line
it's going in boom

294
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
it's going in boom
 

295
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,500
it's going in boom
okay try it again

296
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,510

 

297
00:09:40,510 --> 00:10:02,829

299
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,960

so

300
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:07,970

so

304
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
