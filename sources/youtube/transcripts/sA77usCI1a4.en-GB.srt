1
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,610
Why did you start practicing Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu?

2
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,360
I was living abroad and because I am Japanese,

3
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,510
I wanted to learn something about my culture, my history

4
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,330
and since Daito-ryu is a Kobudo, it is grounded in history, that is why I wanted to start.

5
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,080
If you enter like this... here... nothing moves.

6
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,620
So just leave it like that, just put your hand on top of his hand,

7
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,220
leave it like this and don't mind him.

8
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,550
If he wants to strike, you can strike first...

9
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,740
and then do a Tai-sabaki first,

10
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,230
like this and it works.

11
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:11,690
I was practicing Aikido but had a lot of interrogation about this art.

12
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,250
There are a number of restrictions in Aikido that can be alleviated in Daito-ryu.

13
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:26,770
I was wondering things like: "Why doing things like this?", "How to do that?"

14
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,960
but I got the answers in Daito-ryu.

15
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,600
Let's take Aiki-age as an example,

16
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,690
In Aikido, Aiki-age quickly becomes Kokyu-ho, why is that?

17
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,570
What does this mean?

18
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,820
In Aikido, Kokyu-ho aims at performing the technique in the easiest manner for oneself.

19
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,760
But this is in fact the latest stage of a technique.

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,750
In Daito-ryu on the other hand, we start at the first stage of the movement,

21
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,710
when the technique is only merely a possibility. This changes everything.

22
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,340
Open...
from that opening, go down strait, like that

23
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,990
and there the conditions are perfect.

24
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,690
Secure his hand between your two open hands without grabbing him and bring him to the ground.

25
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,170
If you grab with your fingers and try to bring him down, it is hard.

26
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,120
(resist please)

27
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,530
This is what happens,

28
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,460
but if you keep both hands open...

29
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,940
hold like this, flat handed, it's important, it works better.

30
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,810
If you grab with your fingers, you will act on his strong point and it will be difficult.

31
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,420
But if you use the palms of your hands, it is a lot easier and he will go down.

32
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,390
It is here. That way here, it is no good.

33
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,100
Look, the hand is closed, rolled up upon itself, like that.

34
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,610
After we will do it on the right hand but right now look, he does not fall.

35
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,900
Look once again, it's the same thing.

36
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,190
Like that, go on the side. In the front, it is dangerous.

37
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,160
Here... we push towards him. This knee should go on the other side.

38
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:55,310
If you do like this, nothing happens. He comes towards you, it is too close, not easy.

39
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,300
We are too close to him,

40
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,720
so we must go further.

41
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,220
It is the elbow that we have to "return" [i.e. : the word "kaeshi" of Kote-kaeshi]

42
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:20,320
so there are two important points: we must "return" both the wrist AND the elbow.

43
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,920
If you only "return" the wrist, the partner becomes heavy [i.e. no connection between the wrist and the body].

44
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:40,560
So you must remove these two points, wrist and elbow at the same time.
As a Japanese, I wanted to do something related to my culture.

45
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,000
When did you start?

46
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,570
In the year 2009 in March... no, April.

47
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:57,060
Did the practice of Daito-ryu have an influence on your life or on yourself?

48
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,760
Yes, a very good one.

49
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,770
More precisely?

50
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,790
My central axis, the axis of my life got stabilised.

51
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,490
On Obi-otoshi, this is how it goes,

52
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,950
grab from below like this.

53
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,160
If you push him, then he won't come and you won't be able to move your feet.

54
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,470
It is totally different as he won't come towards you.

55
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,120
Do it like that, more rigorous, pulling him forward from below.

56
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,930
I feel that Budo is really a part of Japanese culture, which is why I decided to start.

57
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,320
Compared to other martial arts, Aikido particularly fitted my small built.

58
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,160
I understand...
you just talked about the body,

59
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,680
but did Daito-ryu have an influence on something other than physical?

60
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Sure...

61
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:24,410
the most interesting thing for me is to have met Kobayashi Sensei, to have continued practicing Aikido, and to meet many people through that.

62
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:32,770
In fact, according to the Budo that we practice, we can learn the truth, and at same time keep our body healthy.

63
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,590
We have to get the partner spining

64
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,260
That is what happens at that moment...

65
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,550
it is a bit like doing shiho-nage...

66
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,280
liek this, just like fr Shiho-nage...

67
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,070
here, the partner is still there, quite stable...

68
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,790
and it is at this moment that we must unbalance him...

69
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,590
from that point.

70
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
In fact we don't move much ourselves.

71
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
I think we should start by talking about Takuma Sensei.

72
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,010
Which Sensei? Hisa Sensei?

73
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:15,040
Hisa Takuma Sensei was a student of Ueshiba Sensei and Takeda Sensei.

74
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,690
That being said, Takuma Sensei started under Ueshiba Sensei

75
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,160
in what corresponds today to Yoshinkan Aikido.

76
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,580
So he started like that as a student of Ueshiba Sensei

77
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,170
and trained with him at the Dojo of the Asahi Newspaper. What he taught was not "Ueshiba-ryu"

78
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,130
But it wasn’t called "Daito-ryu" either.

79
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,180
It was in 1938, maybe before.

80
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,630
Impressive!

81
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,520
Yes, perhaps it was even in 1936 or 1937, I am not too sure.

82
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,340
Either ways, Takuma Sensei received his Menkyo-kaiden in 1940 [from Sokaku Takeda].

83
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:06,480
It is while Takuma was studying with Ueshiba Sensei that Takeda Sensei came over to Osaka to visit,

84
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,860
It seems that he came in order to improve the level of what was taught by Ueshiba Sensei

85
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,840
during the morning and noon classes.

86
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,310
But when Ueshiba Sensei heard that Takeda Sokaku was on his way, he left in haste for Tokyo without even greeting him.

87
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,920
Hisa Sensei therefore stared to train under Sokaku Takeda from that point on.

88
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,990
At that time, the techniques taught daily were all different and they had to remember them nonetheless.

89
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:36,450
It was quite hard to memorise so they started to keep a photographic record in order to remember them.

90
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,110
This became the series of technical snapshots called "Soden" which can still be studied today.

91
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,690
Actually, Daito-ryu was quite confused and disordered.

92
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:57,380
So Takeda Tokimune Senseiď [Takeda Sokaku'son] told to his father: "We should classify the techniques a bit better".

93
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,680
Ueshiba Sensei for example had indeed taught using the syllabus that we know today: "Ikkyo, Nikkyo, Sankyo, Yonkyo…"

94
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,880
And if we look at Yoshinkan, it was also these four techniques built and organised in a vertical manner.

95
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,860
But Ueshiba's techniques were a bit different so Tokimune said to his father:

96
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,740
"Father, we should give back Ikkajo its essence and resume the 118 kihon. Wouldn't it be beneficial? What do you think?"

97
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,590
His father answered:

98
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,560
"Some of my students have already obtained the Kyoju-dairi, I don't have much more to teach them, isn't it enough?

99
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,560
Don't they know enough?"

100
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,210
This began the next stage of teaching.

101
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,730
Sensei, you learnt Aikido at the Aikikai Honbu Dojo right?

102
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,520
When was it?

103
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,250
I became the student of Hisa Takuma Sensei.

104
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:49,480
And while I was training regularly, I was also a student.

105
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,940
I had to use the situation so I opened an Aikido club.

106
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,890
I gathered some students on the one hand,

107
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,190
and thanks to a letter of introduction from Hisa Sensei, I could meet Tokimune Sense and go to his seminars.

108
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,990
Fro, that I went to follow classes at the Yoshinkan and at the Aikikai.

109
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,590
I got that letter of introduction from Takuma Sensei around March 1966

110
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,680
so that I could meet Ueshiba Sensei, Takuma Sensei's former teacher.

111
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,770
Was Morihei Ueshiba Sensei still teaching at the time?

112
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,040
Yes, he taught the first morning class, but I can't remember which days.

113
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,030
And then it was Kisshomaru Sensei.

114
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,150
Kisshomaru Sensei… right...

115
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,880
Yes, Kisshomaru Sensei was teaching the other morning and evening classes

116
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,530
with also the other classes taught by the Uchi-deshi so I could train every day.

117
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:06,530
And now in during your classes in Tokyo, a lot of students come from an Aikido background to study Daito-ryu isn't it?

118
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,270
Sensei, what do you think about people coming from Aikido to study Daito-ryu?

119
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,530
Yes, as I said before, Hisa Sensei started to learn from Ueshiba Sensei

120
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,790
and he later became a student of Takeda Senseď. There is no incompatibility.

121
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:29,000
Whether they are Ueshiba's or Takeda's techniques, there is no profound disagreement

122
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,060
because very naturally, Daito-ryu techniques evolve into Aikido techniques.

123
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,400
For these Sensei, there is no doubt that Daito-ryu led to Aikido.

124
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,050
For me it was the same, in Tokyo, because I had obtained an introduction letter to train with Ueshiba Sensei and Shioda Sensei,

125
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:51,750
I could train both morning classes and the evening class at the Honbu Dojo,

126
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,040
And the the lunch class at the Yoshinkan.

127
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,590
Really? Who was teaching at the Yoshinkan?

128
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,650
It was Shioda Sensei's students, mister Kushida and Inoue.

129
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,780
But Shioda Sensei did not teach anymore, I was too important.

130
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,480
There were also other black belt instructors whose names I have forgotten.

131
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,820
This is where I learnt. In fact, Yoshinkan techniques really looked like Hisa Takuma Sensei's techniques.

132
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,140
The techniques taught at the Asahi newspaper were conform to those taught in Tokyo at the Yoshinkan Iidabashi dojo.

133
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,130
I understand.

134
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,100
At the Aikikai however, it was a bit different.

135
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:42,460
While I was a student in Osaka, I had setup an Aikido club, part of an organisation

136
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,170
which was in fact a grouping of several universities of Osaka.

137
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:57,110
So these Kansai universities called us to meet us

138
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,090
as they wanted to get introduced to a permanent Sensei.

139
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,820
And it is Kobayashi Hirokazu who was chosen.

140
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,380
He was one of the post-war uchi deshi of Morihei Ueshiba.

141
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,190
So he was sent on behalf of the Aikikai to Osaka.

142
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,210
Takuma Hisa had been a sumotori and his knees were bad so he could not take the charge.

143
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,870
Besides, I thought that once I graduated, Daito-ryu might disappear from the university,

144
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,400
so I thought that it was best to affiliate with Ueshiba since there was already an Aikido federation.

145
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,150
So I suggested to Hisa Sensei to affiliate the club to the Aikido federation and he agreed.

146
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,670
The technical director for Kansai was Kisshomaru Sensei

147
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,160
but the club was to stay under the direction of Takuma Hisa, ensuring a courteous relationship.

148
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,460
Takuma asked Kobayashi Hirokazu to run the club.

149
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,080
It is at this point that the club went from Daito-ryu to Aikido.

150
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:05,080
Since Takuma had asked Kobayashi, he said that he did well and that is how it went.

151
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,360
Incidentally, Kobayashi Hirokazu Sensei had learned from Takuma Sensei,

152
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,500
he had studied with him.

153
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:28,560
So it happened like that and things changed a lot in the club.

154
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:38,920
Everyone left and went to practice Aikido but I continued to practice both,

155
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,580
I did both Daito-ryu and Aikido.

156
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,990
Kobayashi Sensei, you now come every month from Osaka to teach in Tokyo,

157
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,700
how did you start teaching Daito-ryu there?

158
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,670
I have former students there, including Kawabe Takeshi Sensei,

he wanted to practice Daito-ryu in Tokyo so he asked me if I wanted to help.

160
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,500
In fact, he only taught three or four times, i was really busy...

161
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,190
so I took over from that point.

162
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,880
What do you think about the Tokyo group?

163
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,070
It is quit easy in Tokyo.

164
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,580
Once students grasp the meaning I want to give to my techniques, it becomes easier.

165
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,570
And because I am not very good,

166
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,190
although I did learn a lot in Hokkaďdo,

167
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,640
it is good to think about passing on to future generations.

168
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,040
Thank you very much.
