00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,230

okay so first of all uh

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
okay so first of all uh
 

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,269
okay so first of all uh
the headlock works

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
the headlock works
 

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,030
the headlock works
on the concept that if i control his

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
on the concept that if i control his
 

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,990
on the concept that if i control his
head

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
head
 

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,990
head
i control him okay so i can stabilize

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
i control him okay so i can stabilize
 

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,310
i control him okay so i can stabilize
his

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
his
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,590
his
head and wherever he moves he tries to

14
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
head and wherever he moves he tries to
 

15
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,710
head and wherever he moves he tries to
move i can just

16
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
move i can just
 

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,630
move i can just
check that out

18
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640

 

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,030

don't make a big goofy thing

20
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040

 

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,110

here

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120

 

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,229

support your wrist here

24
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
support your wrist here
 

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,790
support your wrist here
if you if you go to punch you can grab

26
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
if you if you go to punch you can grab
 

27
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,830
if you if you go to punch you can grab
on your leg

28
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
on your leg
 

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,310
on your leg
down here and you punch here

30
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320

 

31
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,590

or you're closing if it supports it

32
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
or you're closing if it supports it
 

33
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,590
or you're closing if it supports it
or if you're not punching support the

34
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
or if you're not punching support the
 

35
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,709
or if you're not punching support the
wrist

36
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
wrist
 

37
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,349
wrist
lower your center of gravity

38
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359

 

39
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,350

so some of you are like this

40
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360

 

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,030

some of you have terrible stance

42
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040

 

43
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,870

so no center of gravity

44
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
so no center of gravity
 

45
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,990
so no center of gravity
tight on your body

46
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000

 

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,670

there you go okay so there's uh

48
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
there you go okay so there's uh
 

49
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,830
there you go okay so there's uh
there's a mechanical element so he's

50
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
there's a mechanical element so he's
 

51
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,749
there's a mechanical element so he's
gonna do it go slow

52
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
gonna do it go slow
 

53
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,990
gonna do it go slow
he's gonna do it and see this energy

54
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
he's gonna do it and see this energy
 

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,109
he's gonna do it and see this energy
whoa that's the energetic

56
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
whoa that's the energetic
 

57
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,230
whoa that's the energetic
so i don't want to go here and yield

58
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
so i don't want to go here and yield
 

59
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,510
so i don't want to go here and yield
i'm sorry resist don't want to resist

60
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
i'm sorry resist don't want to resist
 

61
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,069
i'm sorry resist don't want to resist
go i'm trying to slow it down that's not

62
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
go i'm trying to slow it down that's not
 

63
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,270
go i'm trying to slow it down that's not
what i want

64
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
what i want
 

65
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,950
what i want
i want to go off balance so he goes

66
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
i want to go off balance so he goes
 

67
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,149
i want to go off balance so he goes
and i just go with it he takes me

68
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159

 

69
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,990

second mechanical component he has to be

70
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
second mechanical component he has to be
 

71
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,350
second mechanical component he has to be
connected to me any space that's

72
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
connected to me any space that's
 

73
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,310
connected to me any space that's
between us is going to create energy

74
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
between us is going to create energy
 

75
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,830
between us is going to create energy
leakage

76
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
leakage
 

77
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,830
leakage
and i won't be able to do what i need to

78
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
and i won't be able to do what i need to
 

79
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,350
and i won't be able to do what i need to
do

80
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
do
 

81
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,550
do
so i have to hold and tight

82
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
so i have to hold and tight
 

83
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,229
so i have to hold and tight
and thirdly my center has to be locked

84
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
and thirdly my center has to be locked
 

85
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,990
and thirdly my center has to be locked
itself so i can't be having a segmented

86
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
itself so i can't be having a segmented
 

87
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,869
itself so i can't be having a segmented
frame

88
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
frame
 

89
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,790
frame
so i can't be going like this

90
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
so i can't be going like this
 

91
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,830
so i can't be going like this
my body has to be engaged is in every

92
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
my body has to be engaged is in every
 

93
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,309
my body has to be engaged is in every
aikido technique

94
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
aikido technique
 

95
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,350
aikido technique
then there's a tactical component but if

96
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
then there's a tactical component but if
 

97
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,869
then there's a tactical component but if
you're doing the second

98
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
you're doing the second
 

99
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,670
you're doing the second
mechanical component you'll reach the

100
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
mechanical component you'll reach the
 

101
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,430
mechanical component you'll reach the
tactical component

102
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
tactical component
 

103
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,150
tactical component
and that is that i hold this hand

104
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
and that is that i hold this hand
 

105
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,430
and that is that i hold this hand
this way this is the danger hand so i

106
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
this way this is the danger hand so i
 

107
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,110
this way this is the danger hand so i
hold it here at the wrist

108
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
hold it here at the wrist
 

109
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,910
hold it here at the wrist
and here at the arm and i bring it into

110
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
and here at the arm and i bring it into
 

111
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,309
and here at the arm and i bring it into
me

112
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
me
 

113
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,470
me
and that'll take away his space for

114
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
and that'll take away his space for
 

115
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,509
and that'll take away his space for
punching

116
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
punching
 

117
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,790
punching
and also connect me connect him to me

118
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
and also connect me connect him to me
 

119
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,990
and also connect me connect him to me
in the second mechanical component

120
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
in the second mechanical component
 

121
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,309
in the second mechanical component
so i just put it together he goes

122
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319

 

123
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,910

over we go

124
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920

 

125
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,630

once we go over i keep my center very

126
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
once we go over i keep my center very
 

127
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,670
once we go over i keep my center very
low

128
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
low
 

129
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,470
low
very much on my side of the point of no

130
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
very much on my side of the point of no
 

131
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,750
very much on my side of the point of no
return

132
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
return
 

133
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,190
return
with bracing supports on the other side

134
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
with bracing supports on the other side
 

135
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,830
with bracing supports on the other side
of that point of no return so he goes

136
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
of that point of no return so he goes
 

137
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,550
of that point of no return so he goes
i'm very

138
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
i'm very
 

139
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,910
i'm very
loose my center's low on the other side

140
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
loose my center's low on the other side
 

141
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,149
loose my center's low on the other side
of his body not high over here

142
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
of his body not high over here
 

143
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,190
of his body not high over here
and bracing bracing

144
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
and bracing bracing
 

145
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,670
and bracing bracing
i don't want him to keep the residual

146
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
i don't want him to keep the residual
 

147
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,710
i don't want him to keep the residual
energy going

148
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
energy going
 

149
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:55,110
energy going
and i go over again

150
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120

 

151
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,949

he goes

152
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
he goes
 

153
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,630
he goes
here okay

154
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
here okay
 

155
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,830
here okay
i'm going to use my hand

156
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
i'm going to use my hand
 

157
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,750
i'm going to use my hand
so i have to replace that base of

problem
 

385
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,990
problem
is it's the problem of form so no one

386
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
is it's the problem of form so no one
 

387
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,069
is it's the problem of form so no one
told you that's the beginning or the

00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
told you that's the beginning or the
 

389
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,350
told you that's the beginning or the
middle or the end but

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
middle or the end but
 

391
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,269
middle or the end but
you as a dichotomous thinking being

00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
you as a dichotomous thinking being
 

393
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,230
you as a dichotomous thinking being
you go ahead and create a time sequence

394
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
you go ahead and create a time sequence
 

395
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,230
you go ahead and create a time sequence
you have a beginning middle end

396
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
you have a beginning middle end
 

397
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,949
you have a beginning middle end
and then what you'll find is nobody

398
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
and then what you'll find is nobody
 

399
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,230
and then what you'll find is nobody
starts when you say

400
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
starts when you say
 

401
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,350
starts when you say
go in in a fight they're either already

402
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
go in in a fight they're either already
 

403
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,110
go in in a fight they're either already
going or they're not going

404
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
going or they're not going
 

405
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,629
going or they're not going
okay so if you're down

406
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639

 

407
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,509

and uh so we're here i'm gonna do the

408
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
and uh so we're here i'm gonna do the
 

409
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,069
and uh so we're here i'm gonna do the
headlock

410
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
headlock
 

411
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,430
headlock
get off your back get off your back okay

412
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
get off your back get off your back okay
 

413
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,629
get off your back get off your back okay
i'm gonna do the headlock and you're

414
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
i'm gonna do the headlock and you're
 

415
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,350
i'm gonna do the headlock and you're
gonna do the technique and i'm just here

416
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
gonna do the technique and i'm just here
 

417
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,829
gonna do the technique and i'm just here
and everything

418
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839

 

419
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,990

works

420
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
works
 

421
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,230
works
as long as i stay there okay

422
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
as long as i stay there okay
 

423
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,949
as long as i stay there okay
so as he goes so look at the space he

424
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
so as he goes so look at the space he
 

425
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,230
so as he goes so look at the space he
creates go you see that space come back

426
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
creates go you see that space come back
 

427
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,990
creates go you see that space come back
so if he goes and he creates a space

428
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
so if he goes and he creates a space
 

429
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,350
so if he goes and he creates a space
we're just right back where we started

430
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
we're just right back where we started
 

431
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,350
we're just right back where we started
and every time he moves i move

432
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
and every time he moves i move
 

433
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:40,310
and every time he moves i move
and he will never get that technique

434
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320

 

435
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,430

so the reason we're doing it

436
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
so the reason we're doing it
 

437
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,590
so the reason we're doing it
in this kind of sequence is

438
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600

 

439
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,470

you can start a micro drill that's what

440
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
you can start a micro drill that's what
 

441
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,190
you can start a micro drill that's what
that technique is

442
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
that technique is
 

443
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,230
that technique is
but it's missing its key component

444
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
but it's missing its key component
 

445
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,110
but it's missing its key component
you have to find an environment where in

446
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
you have to find an environment where in
 

447
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,190
you have to find an environment where in
the middle of their attack

448
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
the middle of their attack
 

449
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,629
the middle of their attack
there's room for you to create that

450
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
there's room for you to create that
 

451
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,269
there's room for you to create that
space

452
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
space
 

453
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,310
space
and the space gets created because they

454
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
and the space gets created because they
 

455
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,470
and the space gets created because they
were in the middle of their attack

456
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
were in the middle of their attack
 

457
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,310
were in the middle of their attack
they're not in the middle of defending

458
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
they're not in the middle of defending
 

459
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,870
they're not in the middle of defending
me against that move

460
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
me against that move
 

461
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,670
me against that move
you get it so as we go we do the

462
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
you get it so as we go we do the
 

463
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,190
you get it so as we go we do the
maneuver

464
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
maneuver
 

465
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,629
maneuver
as we go upside down i don't have

466
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
as we go upside down i don't have
 

467
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,670
as we go upside down i don't have

i start

474
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
i start
 

475
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,829
i start
