the technique becomes
 

7
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,710
the technique becomes
the techniques are already performed by

the techniques are already performed by
 

9
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,530
the techniques are already performed by
them attacking you but somewhere within

there's lots of different places where

14
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
there's lots of different places where
 

15
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,550
there's lots of different places where
you can defend yourself by doing

you can defend yourself by doing
 

17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,050
you can defend yourself by doing
different techniques

18
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,060
different techniques
 

19
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,970
different techniques
and that's what we're looking at we're

20
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:22,980
and that's what we're looking at we're
 

21
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,750
and that's what we're looking at we're
looking at sometimes Palm down up

22
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:26,760
looking at sometimes Palm down up
 

23
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,150
looking at sometimes Palm down up
sometimes Palm down sometimes middle

24
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,160
sometimes Palm down sometimes middle
 

25
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,349

so there's three places you know while

28
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:32,820
so there's three places you know while
 

29
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,610
so there's three places you know while
doing a technique you can get techniques
