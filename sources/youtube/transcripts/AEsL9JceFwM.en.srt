going to be talking about khan renwazza
so

6
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
so

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,390
so
conrad means adaptive and this is a a

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
conrad means adaptive and this is a a

really neglected so an adaptive
 

13
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,070
really neglected so an adaptive
technique is a technique that teaches

you how to change from one thing into
the next thing

18
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
the next thing
 

19
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,230
the next thing
and unfortunately for most aikido

20
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
and unfortunately for most aikido
 

21
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,510
and unfortunately for most aikido
schools when they're teaching

22
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
schools when they're teaching
 

23
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,510
schools when they're teaching
aikido they teach it as if that one

24
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
aikido they teach it as if that one
 

25
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,189
aikido they teach it as if that one
technique will always work so if you

26
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
technique will always work so if you
 

27
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,870
technique will always work so if you
were to master that technique then it

28
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
were to master that technique then it
 

29
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,710
were to master that technique then it
would always work 100 of the time

30
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
would always work 100 of the time
 

31
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,109
would always work 100 of the time
and this is just not true depending upon

32
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
and this is just not true depending upon
 

33
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,710
and this is just not true depending upon
the physicality and the skill of the

34
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
the physicality and the skill of the

person you're dealing with
 

37
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,910
person you're dealing with
you're probably going to have to adapt

38
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
you're probably going to have to adapt
 

39
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,670
you're probably going to have to adapt
your technique to something else

40
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
your technique to something else
 

41
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,229

that's generally the way i teach so

106
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
that's generally the way i teach so
 

107
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,230
that's generally the way i teach so
if you want to see a set of these i can

108
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
if you want to see a set of these i can
 

109
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,310
if you want to see a set of these i can
teach you a full giant set of these

110
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
teach you a full giant set of these
 

111
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,230
teach you a full giant set of these
but this will give you the idea of where

112
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
but this will give you the idea of where
 

113
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,510
but this will give you the idea of where
we're going with it now

114
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
we're going with it now
 

115
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,670
we're going with it now
understand i covered this in a video

116
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
understand i covered this in a video
 

117
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,270
understand i covered this in a video
that's on youtube you can check out

118
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
that's on youtube you can check out
 

119
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,749
that's on youtube you can check out
but you know a form is comprised of many

120
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
but you know a form is comprised of many
 

121
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,630
but you know a form is comprised of many
techniques

122
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
techniques
 

123
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,990
techniques
so when we look at the form of

124
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
so when we look at the form of
 

125
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,830
so when we look at the form of
shomanichi ikiyomote let's look at the

126
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
shomanichi ikiyomote let's look at the
 

127
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,429
shomanichi ikiyomote let's look at the
techniques in there because each one of

128
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
techniques in there because each one of
 

129
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,310
techniques in there because each one of
these techniques

130
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
these techniques
 

131
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,990
these techniques
could have a problem and that's where

132
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
could have a problem and that's where
 

133
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,590
could have a problem and that's where
we'd have to apply the conrad

134
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
we'd have to apply the conrad
 

135
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,310
we'd have to apply the conrad
so the formula look at shomunuchi omote

136
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
so the formula look at shomunuchi omote
 

137
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,749
so the formula look at shomunuchi omote
so here's our shomonucci that's our

138
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
so here's our shomonucci that's our
 

139
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,949
so here's our shomonucci that's our
first technique right so you could

140
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
first technique right so you could
 

141
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,190
first technique right so you could
either look at it as the um

142
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
either look at it as the um
 

143
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,350
either look at it as the um
the defense right here or you could look

144
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
the defense right here or you could look
 

145
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,030
the defense right here or you could look
at it as the shomonucci but that's our

146
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
at it as the shomonucci but that's our
 

147
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,790
at it as the shomonucci but that's our
our first technique our second

148
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
our first technique our second
 

149
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,630
our first technique our second
is the ikkyo proper which is controlled

150
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
is the ikkyo proper which is controlled
 

151
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,990
is the ikkyo proper which is controlled
the elbow right there so

152
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
the elbow right there so
 

153
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,990
the elbow right there so
now i have an ekill beginning to go and

154
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
now i have an ekill beginning to go and
 

155
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,510
now i have an ekill beginning to go and
i'm doing this ikyo in an

156
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
i'm doing this ikyo in an
 

157
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,670
i'm doing this ikyo in an
omote fashion which means i'm driving to

158
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
omote fashion which means i'm driving to
 

159
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,910
omote fashion which means i'm driving to
the front as opposed to driving to the

160
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
the front as opposed to driving to the
 

161
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,030
the front as opposed to driving to the
rear right so

162
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
rear right so
 

163
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,430
rear right so
um or moving to the rear and if i did it

164
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
um or moving to the rear and if i did it
 

165
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,190
um or moving to the rear and if i did it
to the rear they would call that urawaza

166
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
to the rear they would call that urawaza
 

167
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,550
to the rear they would call that urawaza
which means receptive but right now i'm

168
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
which means receptive but right now i'm
 

169
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,229
which means receptive but right now i'm
doing this omote which means

170
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
doing this omote which means
 

171
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,390
doing this omote which means
front direct so this echo is being done

172
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
front direct so this echo is being done
 

173
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,910
front direct so this echo is being done
in no multi fashion

174
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
in no multi fashion
 

175
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,910
in no multi fashion
then i would continue this in until we

176
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
then i would continue this in until we
 

177
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,229
then i would continue this in until we
got here which is the udeo se

178
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
got here which is the udeo se
 

179
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,309
got here which is the udeo se
and udeo se just means arm pin so this

180
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
and udeo se just means arm pin so this
 

181
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,589
and udeo se just means arm pin so this
is our arm pin right here

182
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
is our arm pin right here
 

183
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,750
is our arm pin right here
and then from here i would begin to take

184
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
and then from here i would begin to take
 

185
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,710
and then from here i would begin to take
him down right and then we'd have a iose

186
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
him down right and then we'd have a iose
 

187
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,550
him down right and then we'd have a iose
which is just the the pin that happens

188
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
which is just the the pin that happens
 

189
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,630
which is just the the pin that happens
on the ground so that would be the full

190
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
on the ground so that would be the full
 

191
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,589
on the ground so that would be the full
form for this

192
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
form for this
 

193
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,470
form for this
now each one of those technical parts

194
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
now each one of those technical parts
 

195
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,030
now each one of those technical parts
could

196
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
could
 

197
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,270
could
need conrad which is an adaptation

198
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
need conrad which is an adaptation
 

199
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,790
need conrad which is an adaptation
because he's doing something

200
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
because he's doing something
 

201
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,869
because he's doing something
so let's look at uh the first one which

202
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
so let's look at uh the first one which
 

203
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,790
so let's look at uh the first one which
is uh ikyo

204
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
is uh ikyo
 

205
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,830
is uh ikyo
to konren iriminage so

206
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
to konren iriminage so
 

207
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,630
to konren iriminage so
ikyokonren iminage so the shomenuchikiyo

208
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
ikyokonren iminage so the shomenuchikiyo
 

209
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,509
ikyokonren iminage so the shomenuchikiyo
is happening

210
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
is happening
 

211
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,030

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
to me so if we go to the front here
 

273
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,869
to me so if we go to the front here
let's go just a little bit this way okay

274
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
let's go just a little bit this way okay
 

275

let's go just a little bit this way okay
so i'm driving into this guy and he

276
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
so i'm driving into this guy and he
 

277
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,190
so i'm driving into this guy and he

281
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,710
now look to get him nugget all i've got
to do is slide the echo hand over here

282
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
to do is slide the echo hand over here
 

283
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,309
to do is slide the echo hand over here
that will release him he'll stand bolt

284
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
that will release him he'll stand bolt
 

285
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,990
that will release him he'll stand bolt
upright which is what he wants to do and

286
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
upright which is what he wants to do and
 

287
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,110
upright which is what he wants to do and
i come right through here

288
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
i come right through here
 

289
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,270
i come right through here
and we get idimi nagi off of that so the

290
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
and we get idimi nagi off of that so the
 

291
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,789
and we get idimi nagi off of that so the
idimi nage conrans

292
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
idimi nage conrans
 

293
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,670
idimi nage conrans
really naturally from the ikyo if

294
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
really naturally from the ikyo if
 

295
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,870
really naturally from the ikyo if
they're turning their back like that so

296
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
they're turning their back like that so
 

297
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,310
they're turning their back like that so
if you get a guy who's doing that a lot

298
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
if you get a guy who's doing that a lot
 

299
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,990
if you get a guy who's doing that a lot
you're going to get the idi minage

300
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
you're going to get the idi minage
 

301
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,350
you're going to get the idi minage
so that's where we're having a problem

302
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
so that's where we're having a problem
 

303
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,590
so that's where we're having a problem
with our ikyo and it conrans

304
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
with our ikyo and it conrans
 

305
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,030
with our ikyo and it conrans
okay now in that same uh same technical

306
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
okay now in that same uh same technical
 

307
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,310
okay now in that same uh same technical
problem set

308
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
problem set
 

309
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,830
problem set
so we could be here and he could be

310
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
so we could be here and he could be
 

311
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,310
so we could be here and he could be
pushing directly against me like this

312
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
pushing directly against me like this
 

313
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,990
pushing directly against me like this
right so oh he's really pushing against

314
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
right so oh he's really pushing against
 

315
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,430
right so oh he's really pushing against
me and that's because he's so strongly

316
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
me and that's because he's so strongly
 

317
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,070
me and that's because he's so strongly
he can just

318
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
he can just
 

319
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,150
he can just
force himself back down like that okay

320
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
force himself back down like that okay
 

321
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,590
force himself back down like that okay
he's just pushing right up against me

322
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
he's just pushing right up against me
 

323
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,510
he's just pushing right up against me
okay so now we're going to use ikkyo

324
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
okay so now we're going to use ikkyo
 

325
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,510
okay so now we're going to use ikkyo
so we're going to ikyo we're going to

326
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
so we're going to ikyo we're going to
 

327
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,909
so we're going to ikyo we're going to
adapt that ikyo into a kokinagi so as

328
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
adapt that ikyo into a kokinagi so as
 

329
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,670
adapt that ikyo into a kokinagi so as
he's pushing into me i let that go by

330
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
he's pushing into me i let that go by
 

331
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,790
he's pushing into me i let that go by
and i step in here and i get the

332
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
and i step in here and i get the
 

333
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,909
and i step in here and i get the
kokinagi

334
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
kokinagi
 

335
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,150
kokinagi
so again you see how naturally this sets

336
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
so again you see how naturally this sets
 

337
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,230
so again you see how naturally this sets
up he's pushing i let that go right over

338
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
up he's pushing i let that go right over
 

339
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,110
up he's pushing i let that go right over
my head like this

340
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
my head like this
 

341
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,430
my head like this
this pushes his hips sorry this pushes

342
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
this pushes his hips sorry this pushes
 

343
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,550
this pushes his hips sorry this pushes
his hips into my hips

344
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
his hips into my hips
 

345
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,070
his hips into my hips
and i step right through that imbalance

346
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
and i step right through that imbalance
 

347
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,150
and i step right through that imbalance
right so he does it to himself ninety

348
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
right so he does it to himself ninety
 

349
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,590
right so he does it to himself ninety
percent of the time he comes in i hit my

350
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
percent of the time he comes in i hit my
 

351
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,790
percent of the time he comes in i hit my
hips right here boom

352
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
hips right here boom
 

353
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,909
hips right here boom
and then i just drive right through him

354
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
and then i just drive right through him
 

355
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,550
and then i just drive right through him
for the kolkynage so that's

356
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560

 

357
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,150

right so that's how you would adapt in

358
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
right so that's how you would adapt in
 

359
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,830
right so that's how you would adapt in
that situation we could also have a

360
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
that situation we could also have a
 

361
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,469
that situation we could also have a
situation

362
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
situation
 

363
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,310
situation
where he just drives his elbows straight

364
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
where he just drives his elbows straight
 

365
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,150
where he just drives his elbows straight
down like that right so look he took my

366
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
down like that right so look he took my
 

367
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,790
down like that right so look he took my
ikea away

368
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
ikea away
 

369
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,150
ikea away
now he didn't drive into me enough that

370
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
now he didn't drive into me enough that
 

371
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830
now he didn't drive into me enough that
i could get the kokinage so here this

372
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
i could get the kokinage so here this
 

373
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,189
i could get the kokinage so here this
would be hard to get a coke nugget not

374
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
would be hard to get a coke nugget not
 

375
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,670
would be hard to get a coke nugget not
gonna work

376
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
gonna work
 

377
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,029
gonna work
he doesn't turn his back towards me at

378
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039

me
 

383
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,590
me
but here when he drops this i can turn

384
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
but here when he drops this i can turn
 

385
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
but here when he drops this i can turn
out so sotomori and what this is going

386
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
out so sotomori and what this is going
 

387
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,870
out so sotomori and what this is going
to do is it's going to give me the space

388
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
to do is it's going to give me the space
 

389
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,230
to do is it's going to give me the space
here which is what i want and as he

390
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
here which is what i want and as he
 

391
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,950
here which is what i want and as he
comes around

392
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
comes around
 

393
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,830
comes around
we get kodagaish so that's

394
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840

 

395
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,749

okay and it happens because we're here

396
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
okay and it happens because we're here
 

397
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,350
okay and it happens because we're here
he just steals his elbow away i turn to

398
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
he just steals his elbow away i turn to
 

399
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,990
he just steals his elbow away i turn to
the outside

400
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
the outside
 

401
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,710
the outside
and there gives us a kodagaish right so

402
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
and there gives us a kodagaish right so
 

403
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,469
and there gives us a kodagaish right so
there's another adaptation all those

404
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
there's another adaptation all those
 

405
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,790
there's another adaptation all those
adaptations are happening because

406
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
adaptations are happening because
 

407
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,070
adaptations are happening because
he's resisting my echo proper right so

408
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
he's resisting my echo proper right so
 

409
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,350
he's resisting my echo proper right so
when i'm trying to do this and trying to

410
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
when i'm trying to do this and trying to
 

411
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,990
when i'm trying to do this and trying to
go omote either one he turns his back

412
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
go omote either one he turns his back
 

413
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,790
go omote either one he turns his back
to me right i get the idi minage two he

414
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
to me right i get the idi minage two he
 

415
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,629
to me right i get the idi minage two he
pushes against me and i get the kolkya

416
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
pushes against me and i get the kolkya
 

417
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,350
pushes against me and i get the kolkya
nage

418
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
nage
 

419
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,189
nage
three he steals his elbow and i get the

420
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
three he steals his elbow and i get the
 

421
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,390
three he steals his elbow and i get the
kodagaish right

422
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
kodagaish right
 

423
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,790
kodagaish right
so you can see that's how we adapt each

424
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
so you can see that's how we adapt each
 

425
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,790
so you can see that's how we adapt each
one of those so this is just the first

426
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
one of those so this is just the first
 

427
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,110
one of those so this is just the first
this we could do it for each stage of

428
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
this we could do it for each stage of
 

429
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,070
this we could do it for each stage of
this ikea

430
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
this ikea
 

431
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,350
this ikea
we'd have a really really long video if

432
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
we'd have a really really long video if
 

433
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,590
we'd have a really really long video if
we did that and we can do it for every

434
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
we did that and we can do it for every
 

435
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,270
we did that and we can do it for every
aikido technique we have so

436
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
aikido technique we have so
 

437
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,510
aikido technique we have so
that's what khan renwazza is and that's

438
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
that's what khan renwazza is and that's
 

439
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,830
that's what khan renwazza is and that's
different than uh kaishiwaza and

440
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
different than uh kaishiwaza and
 

441
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,710
different than uh kaishiwaza and
different than

442
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
different than
 

443
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,790
different than
it's like a kaishiwaza is to change a

444
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
it's like a kaishiwaza is to change a
 

445
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,830
it's like a kaishiwaza is to change a
technique over right so

446
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
technique over right so
 

447
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,150
technique over right so
if say joshua's applying uh kodagaish to

448
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
if say joshua's applying uh kodagaish to
 

449
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,029
if say joshua's applying uh kodagaish to
me right so

450
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
me right so
 

451
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,790
me right so
yeah it doesn't matter he applied code

452
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
yeah it doesn't matter he applied code
 

453
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,629
yeah it doesn't matter he applied code
guys to me and so then i apply kodagashi

454
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
guys to me and so then i apply kodagashi
 

455
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,110
guys to me and so then i apply kodagashi
to him

456
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
to him
 

457
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,510
to him
that's kaishi that's to turn it over so

458
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
that's kaishi that's to turn it over so
 

459
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,110
that's kaishi that's to turn it over so
meaning he does a technique to me and i

460
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
meaning he does a technique to me and i
 

461
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,070
meaning he does a technique to me and i
do it back to him

462
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
do it back to him
 

463
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
do it back to him
conrad's different it's an adaptation

464
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
conrad's different it's an adaptation
 

465
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,589
conrad's different it's an adaptation
meaning i do something to him

466
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
meaning i do something to him
 

467
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,990
meaning i do something to him
he changes the situation so i move with

468
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
he changes the situation so i move with
 

469
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,790
he changes the situation so i move with
that change

470
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
that change
 

471
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,469
that change
and do another technique so that's the

472
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
and do another technique so that's the
 

473
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:04,800
and do another technique so that's the
basic idea of conran waza

474
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:04,810

 

475
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,800
