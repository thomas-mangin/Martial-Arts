00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,390
he's catching up because I'm I'm running

backwards and he's going
 

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,710
backwards and he's going
forward so it's my attachment to him

32
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
forward so it's my attachment to him
 

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,550

that sets up the race between running

that sets up the race between running
 

35
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,510
that sets up the race between running
backwards and running forwards you're

36
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
backwards and running forwards you're
 

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,990
backwards and running forwards you're
going to lose running backwards and then

38
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
going to lose running backwards and then
 

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,550
going to lose running backwards and then
he's going to close and he's going to

40

he's going to close and he's going to

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
it okay so in this in this drilling he
 

127
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,390
it okay so in this in this drilling he
he is trying to do his

128

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
it he doesn't have to go full blast he
 

133
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,110
it he doesn't have to go full blast he
doesn't have to kill me because we're

134
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
doesn't have to kill me because we're
 

135
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,950
doesn't have to kill me because we're
drilling you get it but he is trying to

136
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:23,960
drilling you get it but he is trying to
 

137
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,710
drilling you get it but he is trying to
do those moves okay so as as I'm

138
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
do those moves okay so as as I'm
 

139
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,590
do those moves okay so as as I'm
circling around he's still trying to do

140
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
circling around he's still trying to do
 

141
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,629
circling around he's still trying to do
he's still trying to get under and get

142
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
he's still trying to get under and get
 

143
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,790
he's still trying to get under and get
that thing you see and I'm I'm

144
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800

 

145
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,390

not it's not a cancellation of that it

148
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
not it's not a cancellation of that it
 

149
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,670
not it's not a cancellation of that it
is works it works because he's doing

159
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,070
guy he's trying to get me right home
he's trying to get me that energy that's

160
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
he's trying to get me that energy that's
 

161
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,830
he's trying to get me that energy that's
that's what I I want to deal

162
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
that's what I I want to deal
 

163
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,550
that's what I I want to deal
with that's what we're

164
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
with that's what we're
 

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,870
with that's what we're
drilling so he goes boom HP pull that

166
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,880
drilling so he goes boom HP pull that
 

167
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,629
drilling so he goes boom HP pull that
energy so okay what is that what what

168
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:29,639
energy so okay what is that what what
 

169
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,309
energy so okay what is that what what
you have to do in your

170
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:31,319
you have to do in your

slip he's going to come in I'm going to
stick to him and no he goes in I slip

198
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,240
stick to him and no he goes in I slip
 

199
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,230
stick to him and no he goes in I slip
right

200
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
right
 

201
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,629
right
there slip Bo bend the

202
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639

 

203
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,390

yel and that's what I use to

204
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
yel and that's what I use to
 

205
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,749
yel and that's what I use to
throw

206
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759

 

207
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,070

then the throw is CQ

208
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
then the throw is CQ
 

209
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,670
then the throw is CQ
projection so boom H this is

210
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680

 

211
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,589

momentum and that's

212
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:45,599

counter the momentum throw and attack
 

293
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,590
counter the momentum throw and attack
with it yes you go watch watch her foot

294
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
with it yes you go watch watch her foot
 

295
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,829

309
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,590

it you see the projection do you feel

310
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
it you see the projection do you feel
 

311
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,790
it you see the projection do you feel
that okay you guys understand so I've

312

that okay you guys understand so I've
 

313
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,750
that okay you guys understand so I've
seen you do enough projection you can do

314
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
seen you do enough projection you can do
 

315
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,069

attack these the
 

325
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,470
attack these the
projection not before you attack it's as

326
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
projection not before you attack it's as
 

327
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,389

the spiral going you don't get to pick

344
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
the spiral going you don't get to pick
 

345
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:26,629
