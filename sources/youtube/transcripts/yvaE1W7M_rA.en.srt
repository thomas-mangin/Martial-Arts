1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,869

okay so his energy i take to the back

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
okay so his energy i take to the back
 

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,830
okay so his energy i take to the back
mid foot

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
mid foot
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,829
mid foot
okay so he's pushing and he's just

6
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
okay so he's pushing and he's just
 

7
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,030
okay so he's pushing and he's just
grounding me

8
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
grounding me
 

9
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,390
grounding me
i don't need to brace for anything okay

10
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
i don't need to brace for anything okay
 

11
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,749
i don't need to brace for anything okay
so as i have a long

12
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
so as i have a long
 

13
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,070
so as i have a long
relationship to the ground on the back

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
relationship to the ground on the back
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,430
relationship to the ground on the back
foot

16
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
foot
 

17
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,790
foot
i have a yin relationship to the ground

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
i have a yin relationship to the ground
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,990
i have a yin relationship to the ground
on the front foot

20
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
on the front foot
 

21
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,109
on the front foot
so it is in the ikea adhesion

22
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
so it is in the ikea adhesion
 

23
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,830
so it is in the ikea adhesion
and this is in the cochlea projection

24
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
and this is in the cochlea projection
 

25
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,710
and this is in the cochlea projection
okay

26
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
okay
 

27
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,830
okay
and then i'm going to change the

28
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:29,840
and then i'm going to change the
 

29
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,229
and then i'm going to change the
relationship i'm going to shift the

30
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
relationship i'm going to shift the
 

31
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,389
relationship i'm going to shift the
ground vector

32
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
ground vector
 

33
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,030
ground vector
onto the front foot and now this has an

34
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
onto the front foot and now this has an
 

35
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,069
onto the front foot and now this has an
ik

36
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
ik
 

37
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,389
ik
relationship and this has a coherent

38
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
relationship and this has a coherent
 

39
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,510
relationship and this has a coherent
projection

40
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
projection
 

41
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,310
projection
so more

42
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320

 

43
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,869

don't tense up look you see and then

44
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
don't tense up look you see and then
 

45
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,590
don't tense up look you see and then
you're going to push

46
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
you're going to push
 

47
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,630
you're going to push
him out that's not it he's just

48
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
him out that's not it he's just
 

49
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,709
him out that's not it he's just
energy i'm not fighting him i'm not

50
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
energy i'm not fighting him i'm not
 

51
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,790
energy i'm not fighting him i'm not
doing a wrist scrub technique he's just

52
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
doing a wrist scrub technique he's just
 

53
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,709
doing a wrist scrub technique he's just
weight mass energy

54
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719

 

55
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,750

56
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760

58
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
one yong yin relationship other yin yang
 

59
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,469
one yong yin relationship other yin yang
relationship

60
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479

 

61
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,670

there's no flexion up top of my body

62
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
there's no flexion up top of my body
 

63
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,789
there's no flexion up top of my body
i'm not flicking my wrist

64
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
i'm not flicking my wrist
 

65
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,990
i'm not flicking my wrist
the body's not doing anything on top

66
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
the body's not doing anything on top
 

67
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,950
the body's not doing anything on top
okay let's try it okay so his energy is

68
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
okay let's try it okay so his energy is
 

69
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,789
okay let's try it okay so his energy is
coming in and it goes onto that

70
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
coming in and it goes onto that
 

71
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,149
coming in and it goes onto that
foot i keep the same feeling i keep the

72
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
foot i keep the same feeling i keep the
 

73
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,550
foot i keep the same feeling i keep the
same

74
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
same
 

75
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,710
same
feeling i don't want to try to take

76
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
feeling i don't want to try to take
 

77
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,550
feeling i don't want to try to take
energy off do you see

78
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
energy off do you see
 

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,270
energy off do you see
the same energy i move the energy to the

80
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
the same energy i move the energy to the
 

81
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,749
the same energy i move the energy to the
foot

82
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
foot
 

83
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,109
foot
for the other foot so again same energy

84
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
for the other foot so again same energy
 

85
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,270
for the other foot so again same energy
be careful and you go like this is too

86
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
be careful and you go like this is too
 

87
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,550
be careful and you go like this is too
heavy and you try to take

88
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
heavy and you try to take
 

89
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,550
heavy and you try to take
energy off well then energy is going to

90
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
energy off well then energy is going to
 

91
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,550
energy off well then energy is going to
leak out that way

92
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
leak out that way
 

93
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,830
leak out that way
so right into where he is

94
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
so right into where he is
 

95
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,950
so right into where he is
right i'm making a quicker

96
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
right i'm making a quicker
 

97
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,469
right i'm making a quicker
transition

98
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479

 

99
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,590

it's a small shift small

100
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
it's a small shift small
 

101
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,190
it's a small shift small
shift okay try it okay so now

102
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
shift okay try it okay so now
 

103
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,030
shift okay try it okay so now
really small really small

104
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040

 

105
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,630

it's the same process

106
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640

 

107
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,150

but you're taking out more of the

108
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
but you're taking out more of the
 

109
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,910
but you're taking out more of the
external okay

110
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
external okay
 

111
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,390
external okay
so it's really really small barely any

112
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
so it's really really small barely any
 

113
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,190
so it's really really small barely any
movement

114
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
movement
 

115
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:44,790
movement
barely any movement

116
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800

 

117
00:02:44,800 --> 00:03:03,350

don't go over his mask right into him

nothing's going to knock me down
 

123
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,589
nothing's going to knock me down
so i can move i'm going to let off

124
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
so i can move i'm going to let off
 

125
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,750
so i can move i'm going to let off
enough of it to create

126

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,270
enough of it to create
a push and here again the sand is
