00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,019
see and from here I'm just pushing at
 

343
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,350
see and from here I'm just pushing at
him and he actually has my center

344
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360
him and he actually has my center
 

345
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,650
him and he actually has my center
missing and he's the the second you push

346
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:51,660
missing and he's the the second you push
 

347
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,530
missing and he's the the second you push
back in you give him your Center but

348
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:54,540
back in you give him your Center but
 

349
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,389
back in you give him your Center but
when you let it go into the ground it

350
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
when you let it go into the ground it
 

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,449
when you let it go into the ground it
takes his Center away okay so usually

352
00:13:59,449 --> 00:13:59,459
takes his Center away okay so usually
 

353
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,810
takes his Center away okay so usually
what happens is you cast yourself with a

354
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:02,820
what happens is you cast yourself with a
 

355
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,949
what happens is you cast yourself with a
displacement of the Hara

356
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:05,959
displacement of the Hara
 

357
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,470
displacement of the Hara
your mind goes dichotomous

358
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
your mind goes dichotomous
 

359
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,530
your mind goes dichotomous
and then you just are tensing and

360
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:12,540
and then you just are tensing and
 

361
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:41,449
and then you just are tensing and
pushing with your arms okay

362
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:41,459

 

363
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:51,410

foreign

364
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,420

 

365
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,150

you're going into a uh

366
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160

 

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,730

you disengage in between you're not

368
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,740
you disengage in between you're not
 

369
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,829
you disengage in between you're not
using the hint that I gave you or stay

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:00,839
using the hint that I gave you or stay
 

371
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:32,329
using the hint that I gave you or stay
engaged okay

373
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,090

so what's happening is as you push on

374
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,100
so what's happening is as you push on
 

375
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,670
so what's happening is as you push on
him do you see he has greater mass so he

376
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
him do you see he has greater mass so he
 

377
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,670
him do you see he has greater mass so he
you giving him your Center when you push

378
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:40,680
you giving him your Center when you push
 

379
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,650
you giving him your Center when you push
on him externally and that's what's

380
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,660
on him externally and that's what's
 

381
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,170
on him externally and that's what's
happening okay

382
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,180
happening okay
 

383
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,530
happening okay
when it's not happening is because

384
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:47,540
when it's not happening is because
 

385
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,629
when it's not happening is because
externally you have decreased his mass

386
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
externally you have decreased his mass
 

387
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,990
externally you have decreased his mass
in the Torso tilts do you see that but

388
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
in the Torso tilts do you see that but
 

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,129
in the Torso tilts do you see that but
uh it's still external okay

390
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:58,139
uh it's still external okay
 

391
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,829
uh it's still external okay
which one

392
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:02,839

 

393
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,509

so that first double action pulls a

394
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
so that first double action pulls a
 

395
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,430

397
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,269

you gotta get in your Center

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:14,279

 

399
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,050

better

mechanics you don't need to do that all
 

409
00:16:29,040 --> 00:17:13,010
mechanics you don't need to do that all
right

410

413
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,470

crunching there okay

414
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480

 

415
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,130

okay so I I understand that you

okay so I I understand that you
 

417
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,510
okay so I I understand that you
you watch her body okay so she's pushing

418
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:38,520
you watch her body okay so she's pushing
 

419
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,330
you watch her body okay so she's pushing
there's a there's a percussiveness to it

420
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,340
there's a there's a percussiveness to it
 

421
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,010
there's a there's a percussiveness to it
do you see that we'll do that same one

422
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,020
do you see that we'll do that same one
 

423
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,029
do you see that we'll do that same one
again

424
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:44,039
again
 

425
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,390
again
you see but now watch my body and see if

426
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,400
you see but now watch my body and see if
 

427
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,090
you see but now watch my body and see if
you see a percussiveness there there

428
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,100
you see a percussiveness there there
 

429
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,450
you see a percussiveness there there
isn't any do you see so what you what's

430
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,460
isn't any do you see so what you what's
 

431
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,490
isn't any do you see so what you what's
happening as you're observing the

432
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:55,500
happening as you're observing the
 

433
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,650
happening as you're observing the
training

434
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:56,660
training
 

435
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,890
training
is you see the percussion in the uke and

436
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:00,900
is you see the percussion in the uke and
 

437
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,289
is you see the percussion in the uke and
then you

438
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:03,299
then you
 

439
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,570
then you
you percussion as the Noggin that's not

440
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:05,580
you percussion as the Noggin that's not
 

441
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,890
you percussion as the Noggin that's not
it so now when you do your percussions

442
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:08,900
it so now when you do your percussions
 

443
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,990
it so now when you do your percussions
you're doing those external pushes do

444
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
you're doing those external pushes do
 

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,690
you're doing those external pushes do
you see so I I don't do those those

446
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:14,700
you see so I I don't do those those
 

447
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,049
you see so I I don't do those those
pushes she's pushing into me and I just

448
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:18,059
pushes she's pushing into me and I just
 

449
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,090
pushes she's pushing into me and I just
let that go to the ground that's all I'm

450
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,100
let that go to the ground that's all I'm
 

451
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,250
let that go to the ground that's all I'm
doing let it go to the ground so it

452
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,260
doing let it go to the ground so it
 

453
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,350
doing let it go to the ground so it
doesn't matter how much she she pushes

454
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:24,360
doesn't matter how much she she pushes
 

455
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,110
doesn't matter how much she she pushes
we're not going anywhere okay so you

we're not going anywhere okay so you
 

457
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,010
we're not going anywhere okay so you
could do a slow slow

458
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,020

 

459
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,910

hit jerky okay verse 10 don't you don't

468
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
hit jerky okay verse 10 don't you don't
 

469
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,210
hit jerky okay verse 10 don't you don't
do that the energy does that and the UK

470
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,220
do that the energy does that and the UK
 

471
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,250
do that the energy does that and the UK
does it but not the number

472
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,260
does it but not the number
 

473
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,130
does it but not the number
okay your hands just move

474
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,140
okay your hands just move
 

475
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,830
okay your hands just move
and then what we'll do is as you're

476
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
and then what we'll do is as you're
 

477
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,070
and then what we'll do is as you're
going into projection

478
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,080
going into projection
 

479
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,289

awareness to the slipperiness
 

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,529
awareness to the slipperiness
Okay the reason you lose that adhesion

484
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:15,539
Okay the reason you lose that adhesion
 

485
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,029
Okay the reason you lose that adhesion

have too much Yong in the hand
and it starts to move opposite this hand

490
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:27,539
and it starts to move opposite this hand
 

491
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,110
and it starts to move opposite this hand
you you can only

492

you're just going here and just trying
 

719
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,710
you're just going here and just trying
to turn

720
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:18,720
to turn
 

721
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,690
to turn
wait I'm gonna move

722
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:22,700
wait I'm gonna move
 

723
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,149
wait I'm gonna move

boom you feel that see there's a
 

729
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,649
boom you feel that see there's a
displacement see so I'm right on the

730
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:33,659
displacement see so I'm right on the
 

731
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,310
displacement see so I'm right on the
cusp of it so you can see

732
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
cusp of it so you can see
 

733
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,430
cusp of it so you can see
you see okay I'm right on the cusp of it

734
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,440
you see okay I'm right on the cusp of it
 

735
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,769
you see okay I'm right on the cusp of it
I'm not gonna get out of the way okay

736
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:42,779
I'm not gonna get out of the way okay
 

737
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,769
I'm not gonna get out of the way okay
are you right okay here we are if I go

738
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:45,779
are you right okay here we are if I go
 

739
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,930
are you right okay here we are if I go
any deeper I'm going to start to splice

740
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:47,940
any deeper I'm going to start to splice
 

741
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,889
any deeper I'm going to start to splice
it you see but now I use this connection

742
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:51,899
it you see but now I use this connection
 

743
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,049
it you see but now I use this connection
stay there please

744
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:54,059
stay there please
 

745
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,690
stay there please
and I'm going to move the front of your

746
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:56,700
and I'm going to move the front of your
 

747
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,370
and I'm going to move the front of your
palm Den field

748
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:58,380
palm Den field
 

749
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,110
palm Den field
they're not going to get out of the way

750
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,120
they're not going to get out of the way
 

751
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,990
they're not going to get out of the way
you say so

752
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,000
you say so
 

753
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,169
you say so
there it is you see that and if I just

754
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:06,179
there it is you see that and if I just
 

755
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,490
there it is you see that and if I just
get out of the way nothing's gonna

756
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,500
get out of the way nothing's gonna
 

757
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,789
get out of the way nothing's gonna
happen here wait I'm gonna move that

758
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
happen here wait I'm gonna move that
 

759
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,850
happen here wait I'm gonna move that
you see I'm gonna move it you move it

760
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:13,860
you see I'm gonna move it you move it
 

761
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,310
you see I'm gonna move it you move it
not even here I'm not going to not move

762
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
not even here I'm not going to not move
 

763
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,310
not even here I'm not going to not move
it you see again you can see a little

764
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,320
it you see again you can see a little
 

765
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,010
it you see again you can see a little
deeper there's the projection you see

766
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,020
deeper there's the projection you see
 

767
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,649
deeper there's the projection you see
okay so I'm here I'm not going to get

768
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:24,659
okay so I'm here I'm not going to get
 

769
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,789
okay so I'm here I'm not going to get
out of the way

770
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:25,799
out of the way
 

771
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,970
out of the way
I'm going to move just the surface of it

772
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:28,980
I'm going to move just the surface of it
 

773
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,710
I'm going to move just the surface of it
so for example

774
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
so for example
 

775
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,049
so for example
you that's where you came from right

776
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:33,059
you that's where you came from right
 

777
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,909
you that's where you came from right
pull back towards there

778
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:34,919
pull back towards there
 

779
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,570
pull back towards there
you see okay I I have the center you see

780
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:38,580
you see okay I I have the center you see
 

781
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,490
you see okay I I have the center you see
a lot of pressure increase more friction

782
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:40,500
a lot of pressure increase more friction
 

783
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,549
a lot of pressure increase more friction
increases here you see that so I'm gonna

784
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:43,559
increases here you see that so I'm gonna
 

785
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,810
increases here you see that so I'm gonna
move

786
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:44,820
move
 

787
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,909
move
that Center so I'll show you something

788
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:46,919
that Center so I'll show you something
 

789
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,590
that Center so I'll show you something
else that you could tell the difference

790
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:48,600
else that you could tell the difference
 

791
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,549
else that you could tell the difference
by

792
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:49,559
by
 

793
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,490
by
so the first difference was you're right

794
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:52,500
so the first difference was you're right
 

795
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,950
so the first difference was you're right
on the cusp of the projection

796
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
on the cusp of the projection
 

797
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,930
on the cusp of the projection
do you see that

798
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:56,940
do you see that
 

799
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,930
do you see that
second one is if you tried to reverse

800
00:30:59,930 --> 00:30:59,940
second one is if you tried to reverse
 

801
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,070
second one is if you tried to reverse
you couldn't okay and then the third one

802
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
you couldn't okay and then the third one
 

803
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,930
you couldn't okay and then the third one
will use that same angle again there it

804
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:05,940
will use that same angle again there it
 

805
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,950
will use that same angle again there it
is right there

806
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
is right there
 

807
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,169
is right there
oh it's right there you see don't do

808
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:09,179
oh it's right there you see don't do
 

809
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,450
oh it's right there you see don't do
that move this okay and if I void

810
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:14,460
that move this okay and if I void
 

811
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,690
that move this okay and if I void
entirely notice where you want to fall

812
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:16,700
entirely notice where you want to fall
 

813
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,570
entirely notice where you want to fall
okay once I once you start to fall

814
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:20,580

859
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,909

further than she wants

860
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:25,919

 

861

there you go

862
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:47,700

 

863
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,769

try not to hook a hook is ledging

864
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:54,779

 

865
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,750

you gotta penetrate a little bit more

866
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:56,760
you gotta penetrate a little bit more
 

867
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,370
you gotta penetrate a little bit more
initially

868
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:58,380
initially
 

869
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,010
initially
just don't displace

you keep ledging the yin hand

888
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000

 

889
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,950

s better

Center you you obviously have control of
 

907
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,570
Center you you obviously have control of
their center right so he goes well and

908
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:29,580
their center right so he goes well and
 

909
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,609
their center right so he goes well and
we're we're already we're we're here you

we're we're already we're we're here you
 

911
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,290
we're we're already we're we're here you
see oh

912
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,300
see oh
 

913
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,310
see oh
okay but I'm taking control at that

914
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:37,320
okay but I'm taking control at that
 

915
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,129
okay but I'm taking control at that
point you see and what I want to happen

916
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:40,139
point you see and what I want to happen
 

917
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,609
point you see and what I want to happen
is I want him to give me control and the

918
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:43,619
is I want him to give me control and the
 

919
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,470
is I want him to give me control and the
way he'll give me control you see how

920
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:45,480
way he'll give me control you see how
 

921
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,649
way he'll give me control you see how
you're you're ledging on me you see that

922
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:48,659
you're you're ledging on me you see that
 

923
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,230
you're you're ledging on me you see that
okay so once he's ledging on me I can

924
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:51,240
okay so once he's ledging on me I can
 

925
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,470
okay so once he's ledging on me I can
void and he'll lose his balance and we

926
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
void and he'll lose his balance and we
 

927
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,869
void and he'll lose his balance and we
it's just a drill I want to be able to

928
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
it's just a drill I want to be able to
 

929

tell when you ledged on me and then I
want to practice

932
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
want to practice
 

933
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,109
want to practice
non-reactionary behavior of I'm Legend

934
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:06,119
non-reactionary behavior of I'm Legend
 

935
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,870
non-reactionary behavior of I'm Legend
you back I am going to just die on the

936
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
you back I am going to just die on the
 

937
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,870

releasing and inside internally you see
 

953
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,790
releasing and inside internally you see
and here at this moment someone's

954

will push back
do you see that so we're going to use

960
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
do you see that so we're going to use
 

961
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,510
do you see that so we're going to use
that stressor as the opportunity to

962
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
that stressor as the opportunity to
 

963
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,970
that stressor as the opportunity to
develop the releasing skill you got it

964
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:49,980
develop the releasing skill you got it
 

965
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,730
develop the releasing skill you got it
but you also have the desire of

966
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:52,740
but you also have the desire of
 

967
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,069
but you also have the desire of
accomplishing the throw because you're

968
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,079

971
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,950
not gonna you're gonna release the throw
too do you see that and they should just

972
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:00,960
too do you see that and they should just
 

973
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,810
too do you see that and they should just
fall okay

974
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:02,820
fall okay
 

975
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:14,630
fall okay
let's try

976
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640

 

977
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,930

you're like only releasing your hands

978
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:17,940
you're like only releasing your hands
 

979
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,210
you're like only releasing your hands

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:20,220
release everything let your whole arms
 

981
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,329
release everything let your whole arms
drop your whole mind drops you totally

982
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:23,339
drop your whole mind drops you totally
 

983
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,730
drop your whole mind drops you totally
disengage so you got to take her a

984
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:25,740
disengage so you got to take her a
 

985
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,650
disengage so you got to take her a
little further right you gotta wait for

986
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:27,660
little further right you gotta wait for
 

987
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,150
little further right you gotta wait for
her to ledge on you you got to take her

988
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,160
her to ledge on you you got to take her
 

989
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,849
her to ledge on you you got to take her
further she'll ledge on you drop

990
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:34,859

 

991
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:43,010

that's right

992
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,020

 

993
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,730

so let me demonstrate it

994
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:45,740
so let me demonstrate it
 

995
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,230
so let me demonstrate it
it was probably a little hard for you to

996
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
it was probably a little hard for you to
 

997
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,010
it was probably a little hard for you to
see

998
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,020
see
 

999
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,230
see
okay

1000
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,240
okay
 

1001
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,950
okay
so uh when I when I move her so there it

1002
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
so uh when I when I move her so there it
 

1003
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,470
so uh when I when I move her so there it
is you see how I move in your Center and

1004
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,480
is you see how I move in your Center and
 

1005
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,030
is you see how I move in your Center and

1013
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,550
to hold your balance up okay so I'm in a
mover Center when I feel the ledge there

1014
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
mover Center when I feel the ledge there
 

1015
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,250
mover Center when I feel the ledge there
it is right there I let that ledge go so

1016
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,260
it is right there I let that ledge go so
 

1017
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,270
it is right there I let that ledge go so
I'm not going to just uh take her and

1018
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm not going to just uh take her and
 

1019
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,130
I'm not going to just uh take her and
then stop

1020
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,140
then stop
 

1021

were doing I'm going to take her into it
 

1025
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,849
were doing I'm going to take her into it
and there it goes right there

1026
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:25,859
and there it goes right there
 

1027
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,849

want to top to the head to the bottom a
complete release okay structure

1032
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:35,099
complete release okay structure
 

1033
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:54,430
complete release okay structure
intention and tension okay

1034
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:54,440

 

1035
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,890

yeah it's a little hard getting rid of

release
don't don't know yeah I don't want to do

1048
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:32,579
don't don't know yeah I don't want to do
 

1049
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,430
don't don't know yeah I don't want to do
it physically I want to do it internally

1050
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,440
it physically I want to do it internally
 

1051
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,930

1059
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,710
to Crunch your spine again
just let go of all of it

1060
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:45,720
just let go of all of it
 

1061
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,609
just let go of all of it
internally

1062
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:49,619

 

1063
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,470

still got tension in your glutes and

1064
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
still got tension in your glutes and
 

1065
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,710
still got tension in your glutes and
lower back

1066

1067
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,770

same thing it's still in your glutes

1068
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:00,780

 

1069
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,829

you got to make sure he's ledging on you

1070
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:06,839

 

1071
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,650

so that time you went externally in and

1072
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:09,660
so that time you went externally in and
 

1073
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,270
so that time you went externally in and
we didn't have the initial connection

1074
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
we didn't have the initial connection
 

1075
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,650
we didn't have the initial connection
let's cycle through

1076
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:18,660

 

1077
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,829

you can feel like you're and see if you

1078
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
you can feel like you're and see if you
 

1079
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,390
you can feel like you're and see if you
could see it too there's like a a

1080
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,400
could see it too there's like a a
 

1081
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,550
could see it too there's like a a
slowness to the turning off to the

1082
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:25,560
slowness to the turning off to the
 

1083
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,250
slowness to the turning off to the
releasing and it's also not complete

1084
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:28,260
releasing and it's also not complete
 

1085
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,010
releasing and it's also not complete
there's still Parts you're still

1086
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,020
there's still Parts you're still
 

1087
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:43,910
there's still Parts you're still
don't crunch your spine

1088
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920

 

1089
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,430

if she hadn't yet ledged you have to

1090
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,440
if she hadn't yet ledged you have to
 

1091
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,810
if she hadn't yet ledged you have to
feel it

1092
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:50,820

 

1093
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,829

see

1094
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:51,839
see
 

1095
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,870
see
yeah

1096
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:53,880
yeah
 

1097
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,630
yeah
feeling is don't you don't go oh about

1098
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
feeling is don't you don't go oh about
 

1099
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,630
feeling is don't you don't go oh about
now I should be able to do it okay you

1100
00:39:59,630 --> 00:39:59,640
now I should be able to do it okay you
 

1101
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,910
now I should be able to do it okay you
have to feel her press on you

1102
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
have to feel her press on you
 

1103
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,430
have to feel her press on you
when she's pressing on you a lot there

1104
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,440
when she's pressing on you a lot there
 

1105
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,569
when she's pressing on you a lot there
you go

1106
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:05,579
you go
 

1107
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:18,950
you go
again you see the stuttering releasing

1108
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960

 

1109
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,950

breathe

1110
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:24,960

 

1111
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:39,349

watch the hunch

1112
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:39,359

 

1113
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,510

release all the way

1114
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
release all the way
 

1115
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,150
release all the way
hands drop in space

1116
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,160

 

1117
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,450

drop more

1118
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,460

 

1119
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,310

you don't you don't pull them down they

1120
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,320
you don't you don't pull them down they
 

1121
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:10,310
you don't you don't pull them down they
just drop

1122
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:10,320

 

1123
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:31,370

better

1124
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:31,380

 

1125
00:41:31,380 --> 00:42:01,390

foreign

1126
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:01,400

 

1127
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,450

so think in terms of that friction you

1128
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,460
so think in terms of that friction you
 

1129
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,490
so think in terms of that friction you
feel that friction you see right there

1130
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:07,500
feel that friction you see right there
 

1131
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,370
feel that friction you see right there
it is right there right here it is right

1132
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:10,380
it is right there right here it is right
 

1133
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,410
it is right there right here it is right
here okay

1134
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:12,420
here okay
 

1135
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,310
here okay
so when I heard and you ledge on me

1136
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,320
so when I heard and you ledge on me
 

1137
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,290
so when I heard and you ledge on me
here and see how heavy you made that

1138
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:18,300
here and see how heavy you made that
 

1139
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,250
here and see how heavy you made that
hand it's the it's the

1140
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,260
hand it's the it's the
 

1141
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,609
hand it's the it's the
friction that I'm getting away okay so

1142
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
friction that I'm getting away okay so
 

1143
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,210
friction that I'm getting away okay so
for example uh I won't take that hand

1144
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,220
for example uh I won't take that hand
 

1145
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,370
for example uh I won't take that hand
down but watch what's gonna happen to

1146
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,380
down but watch what's gonna happen to
 

1147
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,650
down but watch what's gonna happen to
your to your body

1148
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:33,660
your to your body
 

1149
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,410
your to your body
without hand pay attention

1150
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:36,420
without hand pay attention
 

1151
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,050
without hand pay attention
what's happening it's slipping do you

1152
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,060
what's happening it's slipping do you
 

1153
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,550
what's happening it's slipping do you
see that

1154
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
see that
 

1155
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,829
see that
you see that okay

1156
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
you see that okay
 

1157
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,650
you see that okay
so I'm changing those

1158
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:45,660
so I'm changing those
 

1159
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,930
so I'm changing those
uh yin yang values ratio to now generate

1160
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:50,940
uh yin yang values ratio to now generate
 

1161
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,310
uh yin yang values ratio to now generate
a slip so even if I move my Hound uh

1162
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,320
a slip so even if I move my Hound uh
 

1163
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,790
a slip so even if I move my Hound uh
here I'm under you see I'm under do you

1164
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
here I'm under you see I'm under do you
 

1165
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,250
here I'm under you see I'm under do you
see that I snapped that I just move out

1166
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,260
see that I snapped that I just move out
 

1167
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,630
see that I snapped that I just move out
of the way

1168
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
of the way
 

1169
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,870
of the way
I change the value so that she starts

1170
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:05,880
I change the value so that she starts
 

1171
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,790
I change the value so that she starts
slipping do you feel it again look you

1172
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:07,800
slipping do you feel it again look you
 

1173
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,450
slipping do you feel it again look you
see look look look look look you see so

1174
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:11,460
see look look look look look you see so
 

1175
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,490
see look look look look look you see so
again some of you ended up on the

1176
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:13,500
again some of you ended up on the
 

1177
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,569
again some of you ended up on the
shoulder

1178
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:14,579
shoulder
 

1179
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,329
shoulder
right and you see there's me there's me

1180
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:17,339
right and you see there's me there's me
 

1181
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,569
right and you see there's me there's me
increasing the value you see that don't

1182
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:20,579
increasing the value you see that don't
 

1183
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,089
increasing the value you see that don't
feel this pay attention look what's

1184
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:23,099
feel this pay attention look what's
 

1185
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,750
feel this pay attention look what's
happening look you see that what you see

1186
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:26,760
happening look you see that what you see
 

1187
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,930
happening look you see that what you see
do you get that so it's not that when

1188
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:29,940
do you get that so it's not that when
 

1189
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,849
do you get that so it's not that when
you end up on the shoulder it's not that

1190
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:31,859
you end up on the shoulder it's not that
 

1191
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,370
you end up on the shoulder it's not that
you go like that because they'll come

1192
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,380
you go like that because they'll come
 

1193
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,829
you go like that because they'll come
back into the yin space you created so

1194
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:36,839
back into the yin space you created so
 

1195
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,230
back into the yin space you created so
she's on the shoulder I'm pushed with it

1196
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:39,240
she's on the shoulder I'm pushed with it
 

1197
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,349
she's on the shoulder I'm pushed with it
you see well when it's time to die I I

1198
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:42,359
you see well when it's time to die I I
 

1199
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:45,290
you see well when it's time to die I I
let that shoulder go hyper you into your

1200
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:45,300
let that shoulder go hyper you into your
 

1201
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,290
let that shoulder go hyper you into your
value and you become slippery okay do

1202
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:48,300
value and you become slippery okay do
 

1203
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,770
value and you become slippery okay do
you understand that okay

1204
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780

 

1205
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,890

uh any questions or comments

1206
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:54,900
uh any questions or comments
 

1207
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,690
uh any questions or comments
yes

1208
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:56,700
yes
 

1209
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,630
yes
it is crazy but not if you understand in

1210
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
it is crazy but not if you understand in
 

1211
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,809
it is crazy but not if you understand in
terms of Yin and young values so so for

1212
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:02,819
terms of Yin and young values so so for
 

1213
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,109
terms of Yin and young values so so for
two surfaces to have friction they must

1214
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:06,119
two surfaces to have friction they must
 

1215
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,290
two surfaces to have friction they must
have a value of uh you know they must

1216
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:09,300
have a value of uh you know they must
 

1217
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,450
have a value of uh you know they must
equal value of x

1218
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:11,460
equal value of x
 

1219
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,970
equal value of x
do you see okay well which factors go

1220
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:13,980
do you see okay well which factors go
 

1221
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,349
do you see okay well which factors go
into X

1222
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
into X
 

1223
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,690
into X
yin and yang there's different ratios

1224
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:17,700
yin and yang there's different ratios
 

1225
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,790
yin and yang there's different ratios
you see that so if you don't have those

1226
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:19,800
you see that so if you don't have those
 

1227
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,069
you see that so if you don't have those
ratios then you can't create the

1228
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
ratios then you can't create the
 

1229
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,010
ratios then you can't create the
friction but likewise if I don't want

1230
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,020
friction but likewise if I don't want
 

1231
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,589
friction but likewise if I don't want
friction I'll play that ratio for

1232
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
friction I'll play that ratio for
 

1233
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,510
friction I'll play that ratio for
slipperiness you see

1234
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
slipperiness you see
 

1235
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,290
slipperiness you see
okay that's how it is

1236
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:33,300

 

1237
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,990

most of my practice yeah yeah exactly

1238
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
most of my practice yeah yeah exactly
 

1239
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,670
most of my practice yeah yeah exactly
that's what you want and then you can

1240
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
that's what you want and then you can
 

1241
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,349
that's what you want and then you can
just release it and the person doesn't

1242
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
just release it and the person doesn't
 

1243
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,050
just release it and the person doesn't
have their balance anymore because you

1244
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,060
have their balance anymore because you
 

1245
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,450
have their balance anymore because you
you were using me to hold your balance

1246
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:44,460
you were using me to hold your balance
 

1247
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,970
you were using me to hold your balance
up you see and you can just yeah you can

1248
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:46,980
up you see and you can just yeah you can
 

1249
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,270
up you see and you can just yeah you can
just begin you just release that and now

1250
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,280
just begin you just release that and now
 

1251
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,870
just begin you just release that and now
you don't have a pattern or you could if

1252
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:53,880
you don't have a pattern or you could if
 

1253
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,870
you don't have a pattern or you could if
you wanted to right you could let it go

1254
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
you wanted to right you could let it go
 

1255
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,390
you wanted to right you could let it go
into you and into the ground and come

1256
00:44:59,390 --> 00:44:59,400
into you and into the ground and come
 

1257
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,670
into you and into the ground and come
back out do you see and project with it

1258
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
back out do you see and project with it
 

1259
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,950
back out do you see and project with it
but if I want you to slip I'm going to

1260
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:03,960
but if I want you to slip I'm going to
 

1261
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,089
but if I want you to slip I'm going to
totally release it and you'll just

1262
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:08,099

 

1263
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,710

even when as mage I had posture I wasn't

1264
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
even when as mage I had posture I wasn't
 

1265
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,710
even when as mage I had posture I wasn't
using posture when it came to try that

1266
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:15,720
using posture when it came to try that
 

1267
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,349
using posture when it came to try that
release I had that sort of internal

1268
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:18,359
release I had that sort of internal
 

1269
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,589
release I had that sort of internal
catch as if I was falling yeah even if I

1270
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
catch as if I was falling yeah even if I
 

1271
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,010
catch as if I was falling yeah even if I
wasn't yeah yeah interesting yeah no I I

1272
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,020
wasn't yeah yeah interesting yeah no I I
 

1273
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,349
wasn't yeah yeah interesting yeah no I I
I'd like to use that to springboard on

1274
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
I'd like to use that to springboard on
 

1275
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,089
I'd like to use that to springboard on
the comment I've made is like your

1276
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:29,099
the comment I've made is like your
 

1277
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,569
the comment I've made is like your
release is really slow

1278
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:31,579
release is really slow
 

1279
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:36,050
release is really slow
and uh and then very partial so it kind

1280
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,060
and uh and then very partial so it kind
 

1281
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,270
and uh and then very partial so it kind
of reminds me like if there's you know

1282
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,280
of reminds me like if there's you know
 

1283
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,430
of reminds me like if there's you know
every once in a while I'll tell the kids

1284
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:40,440
every once in a while I'll tell the kids
 

1285
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,010
every once in a while I'll tell the kids
hey shut the lights off and it's like

1286
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,020
hey shut the lights off and it's like
 

1287
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,109
hey shut the lights off and it's like
taking forever for the lights to go off

1288
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
taking forever for the lights to go off
 

1289
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,670
taking forever for the lights to go off
and I'll usually go hey shut the light

1290
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:46,680
and I'll usually go hey shut the light
 

1291
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,650
and I'll usually go hey shut the light
off you know what I mean that was like

1292
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:48,660
off you know what I mean that was like
 

1293
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,170
off you know what I mean that was like
that on my release hey release it's like

1294
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:51,180
that on my release hey release it's like
 

1295
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,250
that on my release hey release it's like
I am

1296
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:52,260
I am
 

1297
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,109
I am
your kid is walking to there but it's

1298
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:54,119
your kid is walking to there but it's
 

1299
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,630
your kid is walking to there but it's
just taking longer you know or you have

1300
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
just taking longer you know or you have
 

1301
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,309
just taking longer you know or you have
those knobs where you change the

1302
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
those knobs where you change the
 

1303
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,309
those knobs where you change the
illumination and I go no all the way not

1304
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:01,319
illumination and I go no all the way not
 

1305
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,710
illumination and I go no all the way not
halfway right it's kind of looking it

1306
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:03,720
halfway right it's kind of looking it
 

1307
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,930
halfway right it's kind of looking it
looked like that but it's just a matter

1308
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:05,940
looked like that but it's just a matter
 

1309
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,210
looked like that but it's just a matter
of we got to get reps we got to get the

1310
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:08,220
of we got to get reps we got to get the
 

1311
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,069
of we got to get reps we got to get the
feeling and then we can be comfortable

1312
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:10,079
feeling and then we can be comfortable
 

1313
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,530
feeling and then we can be comfortable
with it right anything that you have to

1314
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:12,540
with it right anything that you have to
 

1315
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,770
with it right anything that you have to
do faster is going to be more intense

1316
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:15,780
do faster is going to be more intense
 

1317
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,670
do faster is going to be more intense
and that is that means more skill okay

1318
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
and that is that means more skill okay
 

1319
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,290
and that is that means more skill okay
because skill is both it's a skill is a

1320
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:24,300
because skill is both it's a skill is a
 

1321
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,010
because skill is both it's a skill is a
an increase in uh how fast you can do it

1322
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,020
an increase in uh how fast you can do it
 

1323
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,650
an increase in uh how fast you can do it
how long you can hold it right and under

1324
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:30,660
how long you can hold it right and under
 

1325
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,410
how long you can hold it right and under
what conditions you can do it okay so

1326
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:33,420
what conditions you can do it okay so
 

1327
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,030
what conditions you can do it okay so
it's a higher skill

1328
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
it's a higher skill
 

1329
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,990
it's a higher skill
anything else yes I was trying to

1330
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:39,000
anything else yes I was trying to
 

1331
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,710
anything else yes I was trying to
find architectures that would give me a

1332
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
find architectures that would give me a
 

1333
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,230
find architectures that would give me a
like a grosser feedback I was having a

1334
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,240
like a grosser feedback I was having a
 

1335
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,030
like a grosser feedback I was having a
hard time really getting a sense

1336
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
hard time really getting a sense
 

1337
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,010
hard time really getting a sense
especially with Virginia maybe because

1338
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:49,020
especially with Virginia maybe because
 

1339
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,410
especially with Virginia maybe because
of the weight the scrutiny between us

1340
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:51,420
of the weight the scrutiny between us
 

1341
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,530
of the weight the scrutiny between us
that feeling that she was really ledging

1342
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:54,540
that feeling that she was really ledging
 

1343
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,349
that feeling that she was really ledging
on me yeah so the techniques towards the

1344
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:57,359
on me yeah so the techniques towards the
 

1345
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,390
on me yeah so the techniques towards the
end there I was doing things to try to

1346
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,400
end there I was doing things to try to
 

1347
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,550
end there I was doing things to try to
either get a reaction out of her where

1348
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:01,560
either get a reaction out of her where
 

1349
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,410
either get a reaction out of her where
she would push back yeah and that would

1350
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,420
she would push back yeah and that would
 

1351
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,589
she would push back yeah and that would
give me a more gross uh noticeable point

1352
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:06,599
give me a more gross uh noticeable point
 

1353
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,050
give me a more gross uh noticeable point
that I would try to release whereas

1354
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,060
that I would try to release whereas
 

1355
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,170
that I would try to release whereas
before it was too subtle and or I didn't

1356
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:12,180
before it was too subtle and or I didn't
 

1357
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,390
before it was too subtle and or I didn't
have captured I hadn't captured enough

1358
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400

a tilt do you see that and you would

1438
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
a tilt do you see that and you would
 

1439
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,950
a tilt do you see that and you would
think that if once I go here you see

1440
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:03,960
think that if once I go here you see
 

1441
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,470
think that if once I go here you see
there I have your Center again

1442
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
there I have your Center again
 

1443
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,890
there I have your Center again
you're actually in kazushi okay so

1444
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:09,900
you're actually in kazushi okay so
 

1445
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,470
you're actually in kazushi okay so
anything you move right now you'll see

1446
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
anything you move right now you'll see
 

1447
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,650
anything you move right now you'll see
that what what the uninitiate would

1448
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:15,660
that what what the uninitiate would
 

1449
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,010
that what what the uninitiate would
recognize as balance Reiki but I've

1450
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,020
recognize as balance Reiki but I've
 

1451
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,410
recognize as balance Reiki but I've
already broken her balance because she

1452
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:21,420
already broken her balance because she
 

1453
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,510
already broken her balance because she
does not control the center of her body

1454
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
does not control the center of her body
 

1455
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,450
does not control the center of her body
do you see that so and she starts to

1456
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:26,460
do you see that so and she starts to
 

1457
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,849
do you see that so and she starts to
move whatever she do see what happened

1458
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:28,859
move whatever she do see what happened
 

1459
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:32,410
move whatever she do see what happened
to her base you see that

1460
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:32,420

 

1461
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:37,069

so when she when I move that Center and

1462
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:37,079
so when she when I move that Center and
 

1463
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,490
so when she when I move that Center and
she wants to roll there she's trying to

1464
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:40,500
she wants to roll there she's trying to
 

1465
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,309
she wants to roll there she's trying to
take control back of her Center do you

1466
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:43,319
take control back of her Center do you
 

1467
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,250
take control back of her Center do you
see that but when I go no not there over

1468
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:46,260
see that but when I go no not there over
 

1469
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,349
see that but when I go no not there over
here and this is all that pressure

1470
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:48,359
here and this is all that pressure
 

1471
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,150
here and this is all that pressure
increase right here and here's where I

1472
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
increase right here and here's where I
 

1473
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,470
increase right here and here's where I
let it slip you see that so I find out

1474
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
let it slip you see that so I find out
 

1475
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,990
let it slip you see that so I find out
it's much easier to get somebody to

1476
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,000
it's much easier to get somebody to
 

1477
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,690
it's much easier to get somebody to
ledge on you than to

1478
00:49:59,690 --> 00:49:59,700
ledge on you than to
 

1479

ledge on you than to
just push at you okay but if you wanted

just push at you okay but if you wanted
 

1481
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,910
