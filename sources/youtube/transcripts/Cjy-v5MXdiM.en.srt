271
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,110
kodor there are many uh variations of
that and and in the modern era as well

272
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
that and and in the modern era as well
 

273
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,070
that and and in the modern era as well
there are also many variations and he

274
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
there are also many variations and he
 

275
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,510
there are also many variations and he
actually categorized those the problem

276
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520

confusion there but he did uh provide
 

285
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,309
confusion there but he did uh provide
some really interesting categorizations

286
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
some really interesting categorizations
 

287
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,270
some really interesting categorizations
which uh which are really needed in

reinvention actually um

778
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
reinvention actually um
 

779
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,430
reinvention actually um
because the the

780
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
because the the
 

781
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,230
because the the
uh martial arts had to adapt or had to

782
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
uh martial arts had to adapt or had to
 

783
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,990
uh martial arts had to adapt or had to
be used to suit completely different

784
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000

process so what I'm trying to get out

790
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
process so what I'm trying to get out
 

791
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,909
process so what I'm trying to get out
here uh in

799
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,110

obviously this is not enough because

800
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
obviously this is not enough because
 

801
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,430
obviously this is not enough because
even before the modern period there's

802
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
even before the modern period there's
 

803
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,909
even before the modern period there's
every every period every region almost

804
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
every every period every region almost
 

805
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,270
every every period every region almost
is different participation in the

so to lump it into two like that is very

812
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
so to lump it into two like that is very
 

813
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,310
so to lump it into two like that is very
simp simplistic

814
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
simp simplistic
 

815
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,310
simp simplistic
um to put it nicely so another

816
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,320
um to put it nicely so another
 

817
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,029
um to put it nicely so another
one of the problems though with drager's
