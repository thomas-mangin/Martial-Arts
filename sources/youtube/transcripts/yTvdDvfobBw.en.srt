Tuesdays we were working on titanium
nage and we were talking about how you

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:19,500
nage and we were talking about how you
 

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,320
nage and we were talking about how you
know in the previous class with you that

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,330
know in the previous class with you that
 

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,380
know in the previous class with you that
we were working on this skill so it has

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:24,390
we were working on this skill so it has
 

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,730
we were working on this skill so it has
to be in here somewhere

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:25,740
to be in here somewhere
 

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,580
to be in here somewhere
well okay so at the end of class

16
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:28,590
well okay so at the end of class
 

17
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,999
well okay so at the end of class
Jonathan was asking Andrew that he's

18
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,009
Jonathan was asking Andrew that he's
 

19
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,450
Jonathan was asking Andrew that he's
feeling it in his shoulder when someone

20
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,460
feeling it in his shoulder when someone
 

21
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,700
feeling it in his shoulder when someone
is able to be projectable on that bottom

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,710
is able to be projectable on that bottom
 

23
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,920
is able to be projectable on that bottom
hand and was trying to project out in

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:39,930
hand and was trying to project out in
 

25
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,299
hand and was trying to project out in
this technique or the Vietnam or when

26
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:44,309
this technique or the Vietnam or when
 

27
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,260
this technique or the Vietnam or when
we're going on fully on into it and he

28
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,270
we're going on fully on into it and he
 

29
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,299
we're going on fully on into it and he
was asking you know what is he doing

30
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:50,309
was asking you know what is he doing
 

31
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,389
was asking you know what is he doing
wrong and so we were brainstorming he

32
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:53,399
wrong and so we were brainstorming he
 

33
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,610
wrong and so we were brainstorming he
wasn't well he was feeling it in his

34
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:55,620
wasn't well he was feeling it in his
 

35
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,470
wasn't well he was feeling it in his
shoulder he didn't give us drinks in the

36
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
shoulder he didn't give us drinks in the
 

37
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,770
shoulder he didn't give us drinks in the
group he felt like he was being

38
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:00,780
group he felt like he was being
 

39
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,930
group he felt like he was being
compromised somewhere and so we were

40
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:02,940
compromised somewhere and so we were
 

41
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,310
compromised somewhere and so we were
talking on the oh maybe we don't have

42
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
talking on the oh maybe we don't have
 

43
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,810
talking on the oh maybe we don't have
the right structure maybe we're not

44
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,820
the right structure maybe we're not
 

45
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,370
the right structure maybe we're not
rolling forward but we couldn't really

46
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:07,380
rolling forward but we couldn't really
 

47
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,260
rolling forward but we couldn't really
figure out what really was the route

48
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,270
figure out what really was the route
 

49
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,230
figure out what really was the route
so that's just standard odds a little

50
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
so that's just standard odds a little
 

51
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,359
so that's just standard odds a little
bit that we're not version of that

52
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,369
bit that we're not version of that
 

53
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,980
bit that we're not version of that
technique is on the hip

54
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:20,990
technique is on the hip
 

55
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,370
technique is on the hip
so you're not pushing through the arm

56
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:24,380
so you're not pushing through the arm
 

57
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,399
so you're not pushing through the arm
like we are today and so there's not

58
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:28,409
like we are today and so there's not
 

59
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,609
like we are today and so there's not
this there's not this movement so are

60
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:31,619
this there's not this movement so are
 

61
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,169
this there's not this movement so are
you doing this movement because a lot of

62
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:33,179
you doing this movement because a lot of
 

63
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:37,969
you doing this movement because a lot of
you do try to twist the arm over which

64
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:37,979
you do try to twist the arm over which
 

65
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,330
you do try to twist the arm over which
is in my opinion when it's a different

66
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
is in my opinion when it's a different
 

67
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,820
is in my opinion when it's a different
space-time you need to be in a different

68
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:43,830
space-time you need to be in a different
 

69
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,539
space-time you need to be in a different
place to do to cause the rotation

70
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:47,549
place to do to cause the rotation
 

71
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,620
place to do to cause the rotation
between these shoulder mechanism and the

72
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,630
between these shoulder mechanism and the
 

73
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,430
between these shoulder mechanism and the
head the one that we were doing for Oda

74
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:55,440
head the one that we were doing for Oda
 

75
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,699
head the one that we were doing for Oda
is the rotational the rotation is

76
00:01:58,699 --> 00:01:58,709
is the rotational the rotation is
 

77
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,749
is the rotational the rotation is
occurring between the head and the hip

78
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
occurring between the head and the hip
 

79
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,460
occurring between the head and the hip
and so when it's when it's between the

80
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,470
and so when it's when it's between the
 

81
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,350
and so when it's when it's between the
head and the hip there is no really

82
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,360
head and the hip there is no really
 

83
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,690
head and the hip there is no really
inner deltoid there's no deltoid action

84
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:14,700
inner deltoid there's no deltoid action
 

85
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,440
inner deltoid there's no deltoid action
at all it's really might be a peck right

86
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,450
at all it's really might be a peck right
 

87
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,310
at all it's really might be a peck right
and then they're waiting for you or

88
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,320
and then they're waiting for you or
 

89
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,860
and then they're waiting for you or
you're waiting for you Ken and so the

90
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,870
you're waiting for you Ken and so the
 

91
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,599
you're waiting for you Ken and so the
kids already fallen when you get that

92
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:26,609
kids already fallen when you get that
 

93
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,360
kids already fallen when you get that
last thing over there so right so I

94
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,370
last thing over there so right so I
 

95
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,030
last thing over there so right so I
guess anytime that you feel a muscle

96
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
guess anytime that you feel a muscle
 

97
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,449
guess anytime that you feel a muscle
strain you want to look at it

98
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,459
strain you want to look at it
 

99
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,490
strain you want to look at it
of course I think that's what you're

100
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,500
of course I think that's what you're
 

101
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,229
of course I think that's what you're
trying to do here in terms of a muscle

102
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,239
trying to do here in terms of a muscle
 

103
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,520
trying to do here in terms of a muscle
isolation so meaning you don't have the

104
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,530
isolation so meaning you don't have the
 

105
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,590
isolation so meaning you don't have the
proper organization in your body for the

106
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:48,600
proper organization in your body for the
 

107
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,770
proper organization in your body for the
art and that can lead to that but you

108
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:51,780
art and that can lead to that but you
 

109
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,649
art and that can lead to that but you
also want to make sure that

110
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:55,659
also want to make sure that
 

111
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:58,240
also want to make sure that
you don't have these other things which

112
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,250
you don't have these other things which
 

113
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,649
you don't have these other things which
are your you've misunderstood two

114
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:02,659
are your you've misunderstood two
 

115
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,440
are your you've misunderstood two
versions and so you don't understand

116
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,450
versions and so you don't understand
 

117
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,020
versions and so you don't understand
which structure is actually being

118
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,030
which structure is actually being
 

119
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,539
which structure is actually being
utilized here so if I'm going to check a

120
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:10,549
utilized here so if I'm going to check a
 

121
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,959
utilized here so if I'm going to check a
structural consideration I have to make

122
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:13,969
structural consideration I have to make
 

123
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,610
structural consideration I have to make
sure that I understand what the

124
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,620
sure that I understand what the
 

125
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,000
sure that I understand what the
structure requirement is okay and then

126
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,010
structure requirement is okay and then
 

127
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,580
structure requirement is okay and then
then of course always you know if you

128
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:24,590
then of course always you know if you
 

129
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,270
then of course always you know if you
are having some sort of muscle bite and

130
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,280
are having some sort of muscle bite and
 

131
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
are having some sort of muscle bite and
muscle biting that muscle isolation

132
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,250
muscle biting that muscle isolation
 

133
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,399
muscle biting that muscle isolation
could very much be produced in a

134
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:38,409
could very much be produced in a
 

135
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,240
could very much be produced in a

because there's a great deal of weight

138
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:44,900
because there's a great deal of weight
 

139
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,670
because there's a great deal of weight
on it and so the temptation to push on

140
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:48,680
on it and so the temptation to push on
 

141
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,110
on it and so the temptation to push on
it is now be more encouraged and so they

142
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
it is now be more encouraged and so they
 

143
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,229
it is now be more encouraged and so they
will less likely hold structure they

144
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
will less likely hold structure they
 

145
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,589
will less likely hold structure they
will start deconstructing their body and

146
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
will start deconstructing their body and
 

147
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,619
will start deconstructing their body and
start focusing on whatever they can push

148
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:02,629
start focusing on whatever they can push
 

149
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,750
start focusing on whatever they can push
with and that might be your biceps and

150
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:04,760
with and that might be your biceps and
 

151
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,689
with and that might be your biceps and
your deltoids most of the time so yes

152
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:07,699
your deltoids most of the time so yes
 

153
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:13,599
your deltoids most of the time so yes
okay check if there if the if the

154
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:13,609
okay check if there if the if the
 

155
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,620
okay check if there if the if the
resistance can be lessened you see and

156
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:17,630
resistance can be lessened you see and
 

157
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,399
resistance can be lessened you see and
so I could see somebody not finding the

158
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,409
so I could see somebody not finding the
 

159
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,610
so I could see somebody not finding the
hip going to the arm in this version

right and you start going and now yeah
you look at you're doing that or as if

182
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
you look at you're doing that or as if
 

183
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,129
you look at you're doing that or as if
you just wait kind of like today's class

184
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,139
you just wait kind of like today's class
 

185

you just wait kind of like today's class
they're going to get in front of you you

186
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,180
they're going to get in front of you you
 

187
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,089
they're going to get in front of you you
just have to be patient and then it's

188
00:04:59,089 --> 00:04:59,099
just have to be patient and then it's
 

189
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,189
just have to be patient and then it's
really just a love tap on the hip if you

190
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:04,199
really just a love tap on the hip if you
 

191
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,719
really just a love tap on the hip if you
want to look at all of those kind of

192
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:05,729
want to look at all of those kind of
 

193
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,089
want to look at all of those kind of
things really you know everything is

194
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:08,099
things really you know everything is
 

195
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,339
things really you know everything is
those kind of questions are going to be

196
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:10,349
those kind of questions are going to be
 

197
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:15,020
those kind of questions are going to be
answerable to a kinesiology : alysus and

198
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,030
answerable to a kinesiology : alysus and
 

199
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,540
answerable to a kinesiology : alysus and
then also to an architectural analysis

200
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,550
then also to an architectural analysis
 

201
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,180
then also to an architectural analysis
just like you know straight what is the

202
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,190
just like you know straight what is the
 

203
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,969
just like you know straight what is the
angle what the resistance are using

204
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:22,979
angle what the resistance are using
 

205
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,469
angle what the resistance are using
where's your fulcrum where's your how

206
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
where's your fulcrum where's your how
 

207
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,279
where's your fulcrum where's your how
long your lever all that kind of stuff

208
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,289

 

209
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:37,269

so with that also all of that holds true

210
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:37,279
so with that also all of that holds true
 

211
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,320
so with that also all of that holds true
now that I realized that it was a

212
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,330
now that I realized that it was a
 

213
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,269
now that I realized that it was a
tension our game with the stimulus arm

214
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:41,279
tension our game with the stimulus arm
 

215
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,990
tension our game with the stimulus arm
yeah yeah yeah on my last rep and I was

216
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
yeah yeah yeah on my last rep and I was
 

217
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,159
yeah yeah yeah on my last rep and I was
working with shadi wasn't

218
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,169
working with shadi wasn't
 

219
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,439
working with shadi wasn't
I realized I was moving a lot farther

220
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:56,449
I realized I was moving a lot farther
 

221
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,689
I realized I was moving a lot farther
away than the situation demanded leading

222
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:58,699
away than the situation demanded leading
 

223
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,980
away than the situation demanded leading
me to understand that I already had a

224
00:05:59,980 --> 00:05:59,990
me to understand that I already had a
 

225
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,110
me to understand that I already had a
preconceived template that I was going

226
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,120
preconceived template that I was going
 

227
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,790
preconceived template that I was going
to operate under in which she didn't fit

228
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:03,800
to operate under in which she didn't fit
 

229
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,309
to operate under in which she didn't fit
into that they kind of screwed me up

230
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:05,319
into that they kind of screwed me up
 

231
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,570
into that they kind of screwed me up
what I was trying to figure out though

232
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:07,580
what I was trying to figure out though
 

233
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,029
what I was trying to figure out though
was in a situation like that because I

234
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,039
was in a situation like that because I
 

235
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,170
was in a situation like that because I
noticed you didn't have that problem

236
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,180
noticed you didn't have that problem
 

237
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,050
noticed you didn't have that problem
with Tristan or any other week it didn't

238
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,060
with Tristan or any other week it didn't
 

239
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,100
with Tristan or any other week it didn't
come in when you're trying to not

240
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,110
come in when you're trying to not
 

241
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,659
come in when you're trying to not
disengage from the contact is it is it

242
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:22,669
disengage from the contact is it is it
 

243
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,309
disengage from the contact is it is it
acceptable to just move forward if

244
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
acceptable to just move forward if
 

245
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,829
acceptable to just move forward if
necessary it could be that the problem

246
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:29,839
necessary it could be that the problem
 

247
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,390
necessary it could be that the problem
isn't whether you move forward or

248
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:31,400
isn't whether you move forward or
 

249
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,420
isn't whether you move forward or
backward right the problem is are you

250
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,430
backward right the problem is are you
 

251
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,619
backward right the problem is are you
matching right the voi - but are you

252
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:38,629
matching right the voi - but are you
 

253
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,839
matching right the voi - but are you
matching the yin to the young that's

254
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:40,849
matching the yin to the young that's
 

255
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,010
matching the yin to the young that's
that's the problem

256
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,020
that's the problem
 

257
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,890
that's the problem
and then the underlying problem to that

258
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:44,900
and then the underlying problem to that
 

259
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,619
and then the underlying problem to that
is you know the question of mismatching

260
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:47,629
is you know the question of mismatching
 

261
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,059
is you know the question of mismatching
that the underlying problem to

262
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:49,069
that the underlying problem to
 

263
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,659
that the underlying problem to
mismatching is are you stuck on yourself

264
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:52,669
mismatching is are you stuck on yourself
 

265
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,600
mismatching is are you stuck on yourself
are you are you just gonna do whatever

266
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,610
are you are you just gonna do whatever
 

267
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,409
are you are you just gonna do whatever
you do I always step back two feet every

268
00:06:59,409 --> 00:06:59,419
you do I always step back two feet every
 

269
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,990
you do I always step back two feet every
time no matter who comes in no matter

270
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
time no matter who comes in no matter
 

271
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,820
time no matter who comes in no matter
how fast they come and I always just do

272
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:03,830
how fast they come and I always just do
 

273
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,939
how fast they come and I always just do
this or the problem might be

274
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:06,949
this or the problem might be
 

275
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,839
this or the problem might be
are you trying are you rejecting what

276
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:10,849
are you trying are you rejecting what
 

277
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,790
are you trying are you rejecting what
they're doing and so you're trying to

278
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
they're doing and so you're trying to
 

279
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,740
they're doing and so you're trying to
prevent them from from what they're

280
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,750
prevent them from from what they're
 

281
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,379
prevent them from from what they're
doing it's all a kind of non acceptance

282
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:17,389
doing it's all a kind of non acceptance
 

283
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:23,679
doing it's all a kind of non acceptance
right and so this is where you know Zen

284
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:23,689
right and so this is where you know Zen
 

285
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,700
right and so this is where you know Zen
and boutot and the formation of Buddha

286
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:27,710
and boutot and the formation of Buddha
 

287
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,550
and boutot and the formation of Buddha
that's where it happens because you can

288
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
that's where it happens because you can
 

289
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,879
that's where it happens because you can
you can sit here and I might be able to

290
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:33,889
you can sit here and I might be able to
 

291
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,790
you can sit here and I might be able to
in a coaching kind of way once you give

292
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
in a coaching kind of way once you give
 

293
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,269
in a coaching kind of way once you give
me a particular okay I can you know

294
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:40,279
me a particular okay I can you know
 

295
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,570
me a particular okay I can you know
paint out for you a diagram can you tell

296
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,580
paint out for you a diagram can you tell
 

297
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,309
paint out for you a diagram can you tell
them any questions a diagram on where

of options that that you get does you
 

307
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,329
of options that that you get does you
will not be able to take that diagram

308
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:04,339
will not be able to take that diagram
 

309
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:04,760
will not be able to take that diagram
and

310
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:04,770

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,650
realized hey this is not really an
 

323
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,760
realized hey this is not really an

faster and I would agree there is a

494
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:09,889
faster and I would agree there is a
 

495
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,400
faster and I would agree there is a
sense that it is able to travel faster

496
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,410
sense that it is able to travel faster
 

497
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,970
sense that it is able to travel faster
it is it does seem more immediate so

498
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:17,980

 

499
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,100

into your kite in nugget you see and

518
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:48,769
into your kite in nugget you see and
 

519
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,609
into your kite in nugget you see and
your kite and nugget always has a step

520
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:51,619
your kite and nugget always has a step
 

521
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:55,030
your kite and nugget always has a step
of two to four feet and and so you're

522
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
of two to four feet and and so you're
 

523
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,549
of two to four feet and and so you're
not you're not here to match do it do

524
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:57,559
not you're not here to match do it do
 

525
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,400
not you're not here to match do it do
you understand you and that becomes more

already said that there's a kind of

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,050
already said that there's a kind of

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,710
already said that there's a kind of
speed or you know a kind of more

overintellectualizing do you see so in

680
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,470
overintellectualizing do you see so in
 

681
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,940
overintellectualizing do you see so in
essence you've made yourself slower when

682
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:45,950
essence you've made yourself slower when
 

683
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,370
essence you've made yourself slower when
you try to do this mapping these pre

684
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,380
you try to do this mapping these pre
 

685
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,170
you try to do this mapping these pre
mapping so to speak in your

686
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,180
mapping so to speak in your
 

687
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,650
mapping so to speak in your
architectures and so oh I guess it'll

688
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:53,660
architectures and so oh I guess it'll
 

689
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,720
architectures and so oh I guess it'll
work if they're really slow and that

690
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:58,730
work if they're really slow and that
 

691
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,419
work if they're really slow and that
goes back to that whole problem your

692
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:01,429
goes back to that whole problem your
 

693
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:05,730
goes back to that whole problem your
Aikido shouldn't be only functionable or

694
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:05,740
Aikido shouldn't be only functionable or
 

695
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,820
Aikido shouldn't be only functionable or
functioning on slower weaker people okay

696
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:11,830
functioning on slower weaker people okay
 

697
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,380
functioning on slower weaker people okay
so that's how I would approach this and

698
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,390
so that's how I would approach this and
 

699
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,890
so that's how I would approach this and
you know especially like today's class

them and and you know you start going
 

709
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,040
them and and you know you start going
like oh like someone else is pulling

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,050
like oh like someone else is pulling
 

711
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,400
like oh like someone else is pulling
them do you know how to be like you you

712
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,410
them do you know how to be like you you
 

713
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,750
them do you know how to be like you you
know you're pulling them you keep

714
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
know you're pulling them you keep
 

715
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,610
know you're pulling them you keep
pulling them you you can tell you're

716

pulling them you you can tell you're
 

717
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,710
pulling them you you can tell you're
pulling them and you start rejecting oh

718
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:47,720
pulling them and you start rejecting oh
 

719
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,090
pulling them and you start rejecting oh
man I can't believe I'm pulling them hey

720
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,100
man I can't believe I'm pulling them hey
 

721
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,240
man I can't believe I'm pulling them hey
when you okay when you wait where do you

722
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,250
when you okay when you wait where do you
 

723
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,800
when you okay when you wait where do you
feel that you're not holy then stop stop

724

feel that you're not holy then stop stop
 

725
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,030
feel that you're not holy then stop stop
and try to try one of the many other

726
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,040
and try to try one of the many other
 

727
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,910
and try to try one of the many other
angles right that this is a very strange

728
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:08,920
angles right that this is a very strange
 

729
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,370
angles right that this is a very strange
concept when you think about it but it

730
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:11,380
concept when you think about it but it
 

731
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,500
concept when you think about it but it
really did look like it so I always feel

732
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,510
really did look like it so I always feel
 

733
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,660
really did look like it so I always feel
like oh and hey hey can I talk to the

734
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,670
like oh and hey hey can I talk to the
 

735
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,400
like oh and hey hey can I talk to the
person who's doing the pulling because

736
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,410
person who's doing the pulling because
 

737
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,470
person who's doing the pulling because
it's not you you can see the mistake

738
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,480
it's not you you can see the mistake
 

739
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,500
it's not you you can see the mistake
like I can but you guys keep doing it so

740
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:22,510
like I can but you guys keep doing it so
 

741
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,880
like I can but you guys keep doing it so
you really go like okay do you know this

742
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:26,890
you really go like okay do you know this
 

743
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,610
you really go like okay do you know this
is not it right if I'm pulling if I'm

744
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:29,620
is not it right if I'm pulling if I'm
 

745
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,800
is not it right if I'm pulling if I'm
going from 12 to 6 and I can start to

746
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:31,810
going from 12 to 6 and I can start to
 

747
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,510
going from 12 to 6 and I can start to
feel a lot of tension as I'm moving

748
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
feel a lot of tension as I'm moving
 

749
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
feel a lot of tension as I'm moving
towards 6 o'clock

experiment go to 3 ok 3 are still a

760
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:49,390
experiment go to 3 ok 3 are still a
 

761
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,600

little bit of pull all right go to 2:30

762
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,610
little bit of pull all right go to 2:30
 

763
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,710
little bit of pull all right go to 2:30
okay maybe I go ahead in my experiment

764
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:55,720
okay maybe I go ahead in my experiment
 

765
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,040
okay maybe I go ahead in my experiment
hey let's start again and let me see if

766
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,050
hey let's start again and let me see if
 

767
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,460
hey let's start again and let me see if
I was too late or let me see if I'm too

768
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,470
I was too late or let me see if I'm too
 

769
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,400
I was too late or let me see if I'm too
early right let me start connecting a

770
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,410
early right let me start connecting a
 

771
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,320
early right let me start connecting a
little bit more with you at ahead of

772
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,330
little bit more with you at ahead of
 

773
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,170
little bit more with you at ahead of
time really for these kind of classes

774
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,180
time really for these kind of classes
 

775
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,150
time really for these kind of classes
like this where we're really just trying

776
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,160
like this where we're really just trying
 

777
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,460
like this where we're really just trying
to develop the sensitivity and not any

778
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,470
to develop the sensitivity and not any
 

779
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,800
to develop the sensitivity and not any
kind of class curriculum or dojo

780
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:16,810
kind of class curriculum or dojo
 

781
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,080
kind of class curriculum or dojo
curriculum which we have nothing to do

782
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,090
curriculum which we have nothing to do
 

783
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,680
curriculum which we have nothing to do
with right we don't test in it we don't

784
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:22,690
with right we don't test in it we don't
 

785
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,200
with right we don't test in it we don't
give a about that we want the

786
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,210
give a about that we want the
 

787
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,470
give a about that we want the
skills so this is obviously a class that

788
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
skills so this is obviously a class that
 

789
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
skills so this is obviously a class that
we've done before we've done they're

790
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,250
we've done before we've done they're
 

791
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,330
we've done before we've done they're
related kihon before this week this is

792
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:33,340
related kihon before this week this is
 

793
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,520
related kihon before this week this is
clearly an experimental class so give

794
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,530
clearly an experimental class so give
 

795
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,770
clearly an experimental class so give
