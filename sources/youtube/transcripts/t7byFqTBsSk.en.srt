148
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
is there
 

149
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,430
is there
it's there

150
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
it's there
 

151
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,270
it's there
when your finger

152
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
when your finger
 

153
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,869
when your finger
bounced a little bit

154
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
bounced a little bit
 

155
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,790
bounced a little bit
because you was trying to get it so

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
because you was trying to get it so
 

157
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,830
because you was trying to get it so
light that it actually bounced

158
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
light that it actually bounced
 

159
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,830
light that it actually bounced
if i allow that bounce to be magnified

160
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
if i allow that bounce to be magnified
 

161
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,110
if i allow that bounce to be magnified
so

162
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
so
 

163
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,949
so
it's the down but if i

164
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
it's the down but if i
 

165
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,589
it's the down but if i
lose a little bit of that up now

166
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
lose a little bit of that up now
 

167
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,589
lose a little bit of that up now

172
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
so what i have to do is so we all know
 

173
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,630
so what i have to do is so we all know
