work with this technique it's

34
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,270
work with this technique it's
 

35
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,490
work with this technique it's
interesting though because it doesn't

36
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,500
interesting though because it doesn't
 

37
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,440
interesting though because it doesn't
appear in the earlier work of us Eva so

38
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,450
appear in the earlier work of us Eva so
 

39
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,389
appear in the earlier work of us Eva so
most these techniques are probably more

40
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399
most these techniques are probably more
 

41
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,920
most these techniques are probably more
modern and maybe you haven't never even

42
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930
modern and maybe you haven't never even
 

43
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,439

worked on them hard to say so we're

44
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:51,449
worked on them hard to say so we're
 

45
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,790
worked on them hard to say so we're
gonna talk about that today and get into

46
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
gonna talk about that today and get into
 

47
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,860
gonna talk about that today and get into
some of the nitty-gritty of more okay

gonna go to work Josh all right we're

52
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,710
gonna go to work Josh all right we're
 

53
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,290
gonna go to work Josh all right we're
gonna talk about Moreau fedora Smurf it

54
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,300
gonna talk about Moreau fedora Smurf it
 

55
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,389
gonna talk about Moreau fedora Smurf it
always an interesting technique it is

56
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
always an interesting technique it is
 

57
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,359
always an interesting technique it is
not commonly seen in really old like you

58
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
not commonly seen in really old like you
 

59
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,020
not commonly seen in really old like you
know so if you go back to the first

60
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,030
know so if you go back to the first
 

61
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,179
know so if you go back to the first
training manual of the Kobuk con we

62
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:11,189
training manual of the Kobuk con we
 

63
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,890
training manual of the Kobuk con we
don't see Midori techniques appear so

64
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
don't see Midori techniques appear so
 

65
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,350
don't see Midori techniques appear so
it's interesting why would work they'd

66
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
it's interesting why would work they'd
 

67
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,270
it's interesting why would work they'd
already appear well probably because

68
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
already appear well probably because
 

69
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,370
already appear well probably because
he's trying to get dominant control over

70
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,380
he's trying to get dominant control over
 

71
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,100
he's trying to get dominant control over
one arm probably because I have a weapon

72
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,110
one arm probably because I have a weapon
 

73
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,020
one arm probably because I have a weapon
in my hand so I understand that if I

74
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,030
in my hand so I understand that if I
 

75
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,789
in my hand so I understand that if I
have a weapon like this and Josh grabs

76
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
have a weapon like this and Josh grabs
 

77
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,320
have a weapon like this and Josh grabs
one hand well that's all good and well

78
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,330
one hand well that's all good and well
 

79
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,969
one hand well that's all good and well
but Josh would like to get that second

80
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:28,979
but Josh would like to get that second
 

81
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,260
but Josh would like to get that second
hand on there because now it really has

82
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,270
hand on there because now it really has
 

83
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,120
hand on there because now it really has
the ability to actually control me so

84
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,130
the ability to actually control me so
 

85
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,550
the ability to actually control me so
it's a two-on-one grip now what's he

86
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
it's a two-on-one grip now what's he
 

87
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,080
it's a two-on-one grip now what's he
going to do from this two-on-one grip

88
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,090
going to do from this two-on-one grip
 

89
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,460
going to do from this two-on-one grip
well he's probably gonna try and control

90
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:37,470
well he's probably gonna try and control
 

91
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,740
well he's probably gonna try and control
my elbow and drive me down right so like

92
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:39,750
my elbow and drive me down right so like
 

93
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,819
my elbow and drive me down right so like
he's gonna get to this position he's

94
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:40,829
he's gonna get to this position he's
 

95
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,260
he's gonna get to this position he's
gonna start driving me down and this is

96
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,270
gonna start driving me down and this is
 

97
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,330
gonna start driving me down and this is
how we classically see the Moreau Theory

98
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,340
how we classically see the Moreau Theory
 

99
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,550
how we classically see the Moreau Theory
technique applied in i cuter situation

100
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
technique applied in i cuter situation
 

101
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,370
technique applied in i cuter situation
so when he's got me like this my number

102
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,380
so when he's got me like this my number
 

103
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,830
so when he's got me like this my number
one problem is my elbow my elbows locked

104
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
one problem is my elbow my elbows locked
 

105
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,690
one problem is my elbow my elbows locked
down so let's say I try to switch so I'm

106
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:53,700
down so let's say I try to switch so I'm
 

107
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,460
down so let's say I try to switch so I'm
gonna put the weapon hand in this as I

108
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,470
gonna put the weapon hand in this as I
 

109
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,109
gonna put the weapon hand in this as I
do that he just drives into that elbow

110
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
do that he just drives into that elbow
 

111
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,850
do that he just drives into that elbow
it makes it really impossible for me to

112
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
it makes it really impossible for me to
 

113
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,889
it makes it really impossible for me to
get in there and switch my weapon hand

114
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899
get in there and switch my weapon hand
 

115
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,690
get in there and switch my weapon hand
Hey he also has the ability to drive

116
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:02,700
Hey he also has the ability to drive
 

117
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,399
Hey he also has the ability to drive
into me here so he's essentially got a

118
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,409
into me here so he's essentially got a
 

119
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,050
into me here so he's essentially got a
rope field going and maybe you can drive

120
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,060
rope field going and maybe you can drive
 

121
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,609
rope field going and maybe you can drive
me down it's a good strong position for

122
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:07,619
me down it's a good strong position for
 

123
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,889
me down it's a good strong position for
him so the fact that he has my elbow has

124
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:09,899
him so the fact that he has my elbow has
 

125
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,569
him so the fact that he has my elbow has
put me in a bad way

126
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:11,579
put me in a bad way
 

127
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,039
put me in a bad way
so what do I want to do I need to get my

128
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,049
so what do I want to do I need to get my
 

129
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,989
so what do I want to do I need to get my
elbow on under control first thing I'm

130
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:14,999
elbow on under control first thing I'm
 

131
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,220
elbow on under control first thing I'm
gonna try to do is drop my elbow

132
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,230
gonna try to do is drop my elbow
 

133
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,050
gonna try to do is drop my elbow
straight down like this so what I'm

134
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
straight down like this so what I'm
 

135
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,330
straight down like this so what I'm
doing is I'm driving my elbow down I'm

136
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,340
doing is I'm driving my elbow down I'm
 

137
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,979
doing is I'm driving my elbow down I'm
not trying to bite was this way he's

138
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:21,989
not trying to bite was this way he's
 

139
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,569
not trying to bite was this way he's
doing he's pushing into me this way so

140
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:23,579
doing he's pushing into me this way so
 

141
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,860
doing he's pushing into me this way so
I'm actually kind of joining with this

142
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,870
I'm actually kind of joining with this
 

143
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,229
I'm actually kind of joining with this
force and driving my elbow down take to

144
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,239
force and driving my elbow down take to
 

145
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,879
force and driving my elbow down take to
get a little position there so I'm here

146
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:28,889
get a little position there so I'm here
 

147
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,129
get a little position there so I'm here
like this now if I were able to get just

148
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:31,139
like this now if I were able to get just
 

149
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,020
like this now if I were able to get just
this I could probably switch and then

150
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,030
this I could probably switch and then
 

151
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,610
this I could probably switch and then
use my knife to get me the rest of the

152
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:34,620
use my knife to get me the rest of the
 

153
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,349
use my knife to get me the rest of the
way free that might not always be

154
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:36,359
way free that might not always be
 

155
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,729
way free that might not always be
possible though depend on what's going

156
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:37,739
possible though depend on what's going
 

157
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,080
possible though depend on what's going
on I might not want to risk switching

158
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,090
on I might not want to risk switching
 

159
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,030
on I might not want to risk switching
the knife hand so from this position

160
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
the knife hand so from this position
 

161
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,520
the knife hand so from this position
what will I do well this does a lot of

162
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,530
what will I do well this does a lot of
 

163
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,050
what will I do well this does a lot of
great things puts him in a bad position

164
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,060
great things puts him in a bad position
 

165
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,240
great things puts him in a bad position
if he was fairly rigid with his grip

166
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,250
if he was fairly rigid with his grip
 

167
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,309
if he was fairly rigid with his grip
when I did this this might happen which

168
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
when I did this this might happen which
 

169
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,899
when I did this this might happen which
would be hadou key in and of itself

170
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:50,909
would be hadou key in and of itself
 

171
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,819
would be hadou key in and of itself
right so that movement can be a Hadopi

172
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:52,829
right so that movement can be a Hadopi
 

173
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,220
right so that movement can be a Hadopi
clearly all by itself but let's say he's

174
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,230
clearly all by itself but let's say he's
 

175
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,199
clearly all by itself but let's say he's
real flexible with this hand which is

176
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,209
real flexible with this hand which is
 

177
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,209
real flexible with this hand which is
the easy handle be flexible with but not

178
00:02:59,209 --> 00:02:59,219
the easy handle be flexible with but not
 

179
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,189
the easy handle be flexible with but not
as flexible with this hand so as I drop

180
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:01,199
as flexible with this hand so as I drop
 

181
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,780
as flexible with this hand so as I drop
we'll get this position I can put one

182
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:02,790
we'll get this position I can put one
 

183
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,640
we'll get this position I can put one
into the other hand we can do G nage for

184
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,650
into the other hand we can do G nage for
 

185
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,020
into the other hand we can do G nage for
that right so I'm juju now being this

186
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,030
that right so I'm juju now being this
 

187
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,099
that right so I'm juju now being this
guy right let's say as we do this I come

188
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,109
guy right let's say as we do this I come
 

189
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,080
guy right let's say as we do this I come
in here he stuff both me still got me

190
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,090
in here he stuff both me still got me
 

191
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,209
in here he stuff both me still got me
now we have Nico's in here to clear we

192
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:14,219
now we have Nico's in here to clear we
 

193
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,249
now we have Nico's in here to clear we
have 8 cubes in here to clear all kinds

194
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:16,259
have 8 cubes in here to clear all kinds
 

195
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,679
have 8 cubes in here to clear all kinds
of great stuff but let's say we have a

196
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:18,689
of great stuff but let's say we have a
 

197
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,170
of great stuff but let's say we have a
nice deep position and he's wanting to

198
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
nice deep position and he's wanting to
 

199
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,420
nice deep position and he's wanting to
come around I will step into this and

200
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,430
come around I will step into this and
 

201
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,740
come around I will step into this and
that gives us Chloe not against a

202
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:24,750
that gives us Chloe not against a
 

203
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,390
that gives us Chloe not against a
classic technique like you know is

204
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
classic technique like you know is
 

205
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,429

the elbow I get inside my Seidman she

208
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,269
the elbow I get inside my Seidman she
 

209
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,210
the elbow I get inside my Seidman she
threw this guy classic technique right

210
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
threw this guy classic technique right
 

211
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,979
threw this guy classic technique right
that's a big Aikido technique and it

212
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:33,989
that's a big Aikido technique and it
 

213
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,869
that's a big Aikido technique and it
comes up a lot because of this situation

214
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:35,879
comes up a lot because of this situation
 

215
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,689
comes up a lot because of this situation
let's say from here he already starts

216
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:38,699
let's say from here he already starts
 

217
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,909
let's say from here he already starts
dominating over this way what am I going

218
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:40,919
dominating over this way what am I going
 

219
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,330
dominating over this way what am I going
to do

220
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
to do
 

221
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,309
to do
I'm gonna run through this and get my

222
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,319
I'm gonna run through this and get my
 

223
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,099
I'm gonna run through this and get my
approach right so here let's say josh is

224
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:46,109
approach right so here let's say josh is
 

225
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,170
approach right so here let's say josh is
coming around this way and I coming here

226
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,180
coming around this way and I coming here
 

227
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,849
coming around this way and I coming here
gonna get my approach right there and

228
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:49,859
gonna get my approach right there and
 

229
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,770
gonna get my approach right there and
pop him off this is my approach will

230
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:51,780
pop him off this is my approach will
 

231
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,149
pop him off this is my approach will
lead us to a whole bunch of other stuff

232
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,159
lead us to a whole bunch of other stuff
 

233
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,189
lead us to a whole bunch of other stuff
but that's the basic concept when I'm

234
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:55,199
but that's the basic concept when I'm
 

235
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,899
but that's the basic concept when I'm
working the elbow down I'm going to try

236
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:56,909
working the elbow down I'm going to try
 

237
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,030
working the elbow down I'm going to try
to put myself back here if he's cutting

238
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
to put myself back here if he's cutting
 

239
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,860
to put myself back here if he's cutting
that off by running this way I'm gonna

240
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:00,870
that off by running this way I'm gonna
 

241
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,360
that off by running this way I'm gonna
set up all the techniques over here that

242
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,370
set up all the techniques over here that
 

243
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,339
set up all the techniques over here that
I can if his grip becomes weak I'm gonna

244
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:04,349
I can if his grip becomes weak I'm gonna
 

245
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,610
I can if his grip becomes weak I'm gonna
use that to pop myself free okay now in

246
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,620
use that to pop myself free okay now in
 

247
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,529
use that to pop myself free okay now in
this what can he do to make it worse for

248
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:09,539
this what can he do to make it worse for
 

249
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,569
this what can he do to make it worse for
me well instead of just locking my elbow

250
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:11,579
me well instead of just locking my elbow
 

251
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,999
me well instead of just locking my elbow
he can twist my elbow behind me so he

252
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:14,009
he can twist my elbow behind me so he
 

253
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,229
he can twist my elbow behind me so he
can twist it like standard to a hammer

254
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
can twist it like standard to a hammer
 

255
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,060
can twist it like standard to a hammer
locks into a hammer lock that behind me

256
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,070
locks into a hammer lock that behind me
 

257
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,719
locks into a hammer lock that behind me
like this is yeah

258
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:17,729
like this is yeah
 

259
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,459
like this is yeah
twist that arm so as I'm doing it he's

260
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:19,469
twist that arm so as I'm doing it he's
 

261
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,769
twist that arm so as I'm doing it he's
twisting it up here behind my back now

262
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:21,779
twisting it up here behind my back now
 

263
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,719
twisting it up here behind my back now
if I tried to directly fight him in he's

264
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:23,729
if I tried to directly fight him in he's
 

265
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,080
if I tried to directly fight him in he's
strong

266
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,090
strong
 

267
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,780
strong
so as he's twisting it up here so like

268
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:26,790
so as he's twisting it up here so like
 

269
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,159
so as he's twisting it up here so like
this and this is what the guy is doing

270
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:28,169
this and this is what the guy is doing
 

271
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,900
this and this is what the guy is doing
is twisting that arm just like that so

272
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:29,910
is twisting that arm just like that so
 

273
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,430
is twisting that arm just like that so
you just really twisting it over so as

274
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
you just really twisting it over so as
 

275
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,200
you just really twisting it over so as
he's twisting my arm over like that this

276
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,210
he's twisting my arm over like that this
 

277
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,969
he's twisting my arm over like that this
oh and if I try to fight this guy he's

278
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:34,979
oh and if I try to fight this guy he's
 

279
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,890
oh and if I try to fight this guy he's
stronger than me I'm gonna lose that so

280
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900
stronger than me I'm gonna lose that so
 

281
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,450
stronger than me I'm gonna lose that so
what I do instead is I go perpendicular

282
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:38,460
what I do instead is I go perpendicular
 

283
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,760
what I do instead is I go perpendicular
to his action like this so let's get

284
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:40,770
to his action like this so let's get
 

285
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,189
to his action like this so let's get
real slow so as Josh was twisting my arm

286
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
real slow so as Josh was twisting my arm
 

287
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,260
real slow so as Josh was twisting my arm
this way I'm driving perpendicular to

288
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,270
this way I'm driving perpendicular to
 

289
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,879
this way I'm driving perpendicular to
his action and I get over to this

290
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:46,889
his action and I get over to this
 

291
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,469
his action and I get over to this
position this leads us to all the same

292
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
position this leads us to all the same
 

293
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,330
position this leads us to all the same
escapes that we had before so he's not

294
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,340
escapes that we had before so he's not
 

295
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,040
escapes that we had before so he's not
just pushing my elbow straight he's

296
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,050
just pushing my elbow straight he's
 

297
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,439
just pushing my elbow straight he's
twisting my arm like this now instead of

298
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,449
twisting my arm like this now instead of
 

299
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:55,969
twisting my arm like this now instead of
trying to just get that position hold me

300
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:55,979
trying to just get that position hold me
 

301
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,250
trying to just get that position hold me
what the tricep tranq just to fight him

302
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,260
what the tricep tranq just to fight him
 

303
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,710
what the tricep tranq just to fight him
here I'd go perpendicular to his action

304
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
here I'd go perpendicular to his action
 

305
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,690
here I'd go perpendicular to his action
here and that gives me the same madoka

306
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:02,700
here and that gives me the same madoka
 

307
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,090
here and that gives me the same madoka
is before so if I can drop my elbow I

308
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,100
is before so if I can drop my elbow I
 

309
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,340
is before so if I can drop my elbow I
drop my other if he's twisting my elbow

310
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,350
drop my other if he's twisting my elbow
 

311
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,170
drop my other if he's twisting my elbow
I go perpendicular to the force and come

312
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,180
I go perpendicular to the force and come
 

313
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,700
I go perpendicular to the force and come
around and give this a whole nother set

314
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:10,710
around and give this a whole nother set
 

315
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,450
around and give this a whole nother set
