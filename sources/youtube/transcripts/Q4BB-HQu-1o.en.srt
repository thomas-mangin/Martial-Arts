have to do I cannot not
 

121
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,189
have to do I cannot not
happen but there's another reason for

122
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
happen but there's another reason for
 

123
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,350
happen but there's another reason for
why you would have a c hole and not an

124

why you would have a c hole and not an
 

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,390
why you would have a c hole and not an
iy hole well the F first reason is you

126
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
iy hole well the F first reason is you
 

127
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,430
iy hole well the F first reason is you
you will have iole in the pohole right

128
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
you will have iole in the pohole right
 

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,590
you will have iole in the pohole right
and then the second reason is iy no iy

130
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
and then the second reason is iy no iy
 

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,790
and then the second reason is iy no iy
hole because uh it happens past

132
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
hole because uh it happens past
 

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,790
hole because uh it happens past
the but the third reason

134
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:53,800
the but the third reason
 

135
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,189
the but the third reason
is that from a pedagogical point of view

136
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
is that from a pedagogical point of view

move from no cou no internal skills to
 

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,469
move from no cou no internal skills to
having those skills it is much easier to

having those skills it is much easier to
 

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,629
having those skills it is much easier to
go through C than to try to go through I

144
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:15,639
go through C than to try to go through I
 

145
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,150

out can you see that

350
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
out can you see that
 

351
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,110
out can you see that
okay um you can do the same arm

352
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,120
okay um you can do the same arm
 

353
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,269
okay um you can do the same arm
techniques you know I have a Yin arm out

354
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
techniques you know I have a Yin arm out
 

355
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,550
techniques you know I have a Yin arm out
here where I cut over the top and I have

00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,440
a young arm over here can still have his
 

359
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,829
a young arm over here can still have his

to a center so on this one he kind of

362
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
to a center so on this one he kind of
 

363
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,430
to a center so on this one he kind of
rolls out of his Bas of support and on

364
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
rolls out of his Bas of support and on
 

365
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,870
rolls out of his Bas of support and on
the other one Bo I push him out I

366
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:09,880
the other one Bo I push him out I

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,590
the other one Bo I push him out I
project his Center out of his

368
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:12,600
project his Center out of his
 

369
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,990
project his Center out of his
basis that

370
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,000
basis that
 

371
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,829
basis that
projecting that's indicative of C

372
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
projecting that's indicative of C
 

373
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,750
projecting that's indicative of C
okay that separating energy him from me

374
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:24,760
okay that separating energy him from me
 

375
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,190
okay that separating energy him from me
is indicative of

376
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
is indicative of
 

377
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,750
is indicative of
c and I key is a Yin variant so there's

378
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
c and I key is a Yin variant so there's
 

379
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,190
c and I key is a Yin variant so there's
no projection there's a drawing in and

380
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
no projection there's a drawing in and
 

381
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,629
no projection there's a drawing in and
there's no separation there is a

there's no separation there is a
 

383
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,910
there's no separation there is a
communion in that adhesion okay so for

384
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
communion in that adhesion okay so for
 

385
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,590
communion in that adhesion okay so for
example just to show it and get in the

here is a I can use that I adhesion you
 

393
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,870
here is a I can use that I adhesion you
see that so as I'm drilling C boom HP

394
00:11:59,870 --> 00:11:59,880
see that so as I'm drilling C boom HP
 

395
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,190
see that so as I'm drilling C boom HP
and I'll come right into the next

same I adhesion so here I'm going to use
 

405
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,509
same I adhesion so here I'm going to use
that adhesion here I could be on the

that adhesion here I could be on the
 

407
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,829
that adhesion here I could be on the
outside and use that

408
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:24,839
outside and use that
 

409
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,269
outside and use that
eny and then send it back out okay all

pushing into his Center what he's going
 

461
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,910
pushing into his Center what he's going
to do now is let that energy pass

462
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:56,920
to do now is let that energy pass
 

463
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,470
to do now is let that energy pass
through him boom and then push it back

464

through him boom and then push it back
 

465
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,829
through him boom and then push it back
into my

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
go watch what can
 

471
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,150
go watch what can
happen if I start changing my

happen if I start changing my
 

473
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,509
happen if I start changing my
Ru so I I didn't do it there's no

474
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:18,519
Ru so I I didn't do it there's no

upright okay or I do start it and when I
 

481
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,310
upright okay or I do start it and when I
feel it I now went limp again

482
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
feel it I now went limp again
 

483
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,310
feel it I now went limp again
it's loose

relationship and my goal is UK is to
 

489
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,870
relationship and my goal is UK is to
keep that relationship so that

490
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:41,880
keep that relationship so that
 

491
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,710
keep that relationship so that
he can send that energy

so
 

537
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,470
so
one thing was already

538
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:01,480
one thing was already
 

539
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,230
one thing was already
said um and that is that when I project

540
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:05,240
said um and that is that when I project
 

541
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,710
said um and that is that when I project
back I don't project into your shoulders

experienced
 

549
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,749
experienced
this tries to figure it out with the

550
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:20,759
this tries to figure it out with the
 

551
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,829
this tries to figure it out with the
tools that they have okay and for

552
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
tools that they have okay and for
 

553
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,990
tools that they have okay and for
example if they are doing C you whole

554
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
example if they are doing C you whole
 

555
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,430
example if they are doing C you whole
and they're practicing a

556
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
and they're practicing a
 

557
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,629
and they're practicing a
throw this kind of

558
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
throw this kind of
 

559
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,990
throw this kind of
throw

560
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,000
throw
 

561
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,790
throw
or by extension what is that that's just

562
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
or by extension what is that that's just
 

563
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,069
or by extension what is that that's just
a manipulation of your

564
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
a manipulation of your
 

565
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,990
a manipulation of your
uh your frame let's say or your posture

566
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
uh your frame let's say or your posture
 

567
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,870
uh your frame let's say or your posture
such that your line of Gravity Falls

568
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:51,880
such that your line of Gravity Falls
 

569
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,550
such that your line of Gravity Falls
outside your basis support and then you

570
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
outside your basis support and then you
 

571
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,470
outside your basis support and then you
will tilt over

572
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,480
will tilt over
 

573
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,150
will tilt over
I

574
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160

 

575
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,870

you all

576
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880

 

577
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,549

right any any of those versions so you

578
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
right any any of those versions so you
 

579
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,350
right any any of those versions so you
know I come here do you see and then I

580
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
know I come here do you see and then I
 

581
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,710
know I come here do you see and then I
turn all of that is the same it is an

582
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
turn all of that is the same it is an
 

583
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,270
turn all of that is the same it is an
external

584
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,280
external
 

585
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,630
external
manipulation of her shape such that her

586
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,640
manipulation of her shape such that her
 

587
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,069
manipulation of her shape such that her
line of Gravity Falls outside her Bas of

588
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
line of Gravity Falls outside her Bas of
 

589
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,710
line of Gravity Falls outside her Bas of
support and she loses her balance which

590
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
support and she loses her balance which
 

591
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,870
support and she loses her balance which
she then recovers with a gold okay

592
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880

 

593
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,669

um another external manipulation is the

594
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
um another external manipulation is the
 

595
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,789

push back like
that if I pick up the

650
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:48,520
that if I pick up the
 

651
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,390
that if I pick up the
energy you will never be able to do it

652
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:53,400
energy you will never be able to do it
 

653
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,029
energy you will never be able to do it
okay if you're doing shoulder toosh

654
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
okay if you're doing shoulder toosh
 

655
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,070
okay if you're doing shoulder toosh
shoulder push external manipulation Okay

656
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
shoulder push external manipulation Okay
 

657
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,870
shoulder push external manipulation Okay
so so we go and

658
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:01,880
so so we go and
 

659
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,990
so so we go and
I and I keep that pressure on she'll

660
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
I and I keep that pressure on she'll
 

661
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,310
I and I keep that pressure on she'll
never every time she pushes into my

662
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,320
never every time she pushes into my
 

663
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,630
never every time she pushes into my
shoulders on you going to do it do the

happens so if I'm doing it

678
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:36,760
happens so if I'm doing it
 

679
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,470
happens so if I'm doing it
internally the more he energy he gives

680
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
internally the more he energy he gives
 

681
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,830

689
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,270

given to work with the less you can do

691
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,789

uh he's going to get tired cuz he's
 

695
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,190
uh he's going to get tired cuz he's
putting all that energy and you'll see

696
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,200
putting all that energy and you'll see
 

697
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,110
putting all that energy and you'll see
like let's say like medium energy you

698
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,120
like let's say like medium energy you
 

699
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,190
like let's say like medium energy you
can see look at how much movement that

700
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,200
can see look at how much movement that
 

701
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,909
can see look at how much movement that
was that's still a lot of

702
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
was that's still a lot of
 

703
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,549
was that's still a lot of
movement but he pushes

704
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
movement but he pushes
 

705
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,230
movement but he pushes
hard less movement he's really driving

706
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
hard less movement he's really driving
 

707
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,010
hard less movement he's really driving
and I can do less less every

708
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,020
and I can do less less every
 

709
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,549

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:16,960

 

899
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,830

okay so let us continue to look more uh

900
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
okay so let us continue to look more uh
 

901
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,590
okay so let us continue to look more uh
into what it is not okay so

902
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:26,600
into what it is not okay so
 

903
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,470
into what it is not okay so
um I described it and and here I'm

904
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
um I described it and and here I'm
 

905
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,710
um I described it and and here I'm
telling you how I'm describing it is

906
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:33,720
telling you how I'm describing it is
 

907
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,669
telling you how I'm describing it is
equally poetic meaning as

908
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:36,679
equally poetic meaning as
 

909
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,149
equally poetic meaning as
aaya it both points to what you're

910
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
aaya it both points to what you're
 

911
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,389
aaya it both points to what you're
trying to do but as aaya is also an

912
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:44,399
trying to do but as aaya is also an
 

913
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,230
trying to do but as aaya is also an
obstacle to what you want to try to do

914
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
obstacle to what you want to try to do
 

915
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,230
obstacle to what you want to try to do
okay which means it's both true and not

916
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
okay which means it's both true and not
 

917
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,350
okay which means it's both true and not
true so the poetic that I use is that

918
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
true so the poetic that I use is that
 

919
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,110
true so the poetic that I use is that
his energy is going to go down into my

920
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
his energy is going to go down into my
 

921
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,950
his energy is going to go down into my
body and down onto the ground that's the

922
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
body and down onto the ground that's the
 

923
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,430
body and down onto the ground that's the
imagery that you're using

924
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:08,440
imagery that you're using
 

925
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,430
imagery that you're using
Okay

926
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
Okay
 

927
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,430
Okay
um let's

928
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
um let's
 

929
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,430
um let's
see so some might look at this and go no

930
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
see so some might look at this and go no
 

931
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,590
see so some might look at this and go no
this is just a skeletal alignment and a

932
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:20,600
this is just a skeletal alignment and a
 

933
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,549
this is just a skeletal alignment and a
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it

934
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:25,559
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it
 

935
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,870
sound body mechanics okay so uh yet it
failed us when the guy push really hard

936
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
failed us when the guy push really hard
 

937
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,470
failed us when the guy push really hard
okay

938
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
okay
 

939
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,070
okay
so what I describe poetically is that

940
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
so what I describe poetically is that
 

941
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,909
so what I describe poetically is that
energy is going into me and going

942
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:36,919
energy is going into me and going
 

943
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,750
energy is going into me and going
down there's nothing in that that says I

944
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
down there's nothing in that that says I
 

945
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,269
down there's nothing in that that says I
need to have good skeletal Alignment

946
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
need to have good skeletal Alignment
 

947
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,630
need to have good skeletal Alignment
good posture or anything at all do you

948
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
good posture or anything at all do you
 

949
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,630
good posture or anything at all do you
do you understand okay so for example if

950
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:49,640
do you understand okay so for example if
 

951
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,190
do you understand okay so for example if
he's pushing here you you can look at

952
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
he's pushing here you you can look at
 

953
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,269
he's pushing here you you can look at
well that you have skeletal alignment

954
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:56,279
well that you have skeletal alignment
 

955
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,549
well that you have skeletal alignment
and uh you're just have sound body

956
00:27:59,549 --> 00:27:59,559
and uh you're just have sound body
 

957
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,549
and uh you're just have sound body
mechanics okay but there's some problems

958
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
mechanics okay but there's some problems
 

959
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,190
mechanics okay but there's some problems
here my go ahead and keep pushing my arm

960
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,200
here my go ahead and keep pushing my arm
 

961
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,990
here my go ahead and keep pushing my arm
is

962
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,000
is
 

963
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,029
is
not uh rigid so this this would make

964
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
not uh rigid so this this would make
 

965
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,750
not uh rigid so this this would make
sense to a secular materialist but this

966
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
sense to a secular materialist but this
 

967
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,230
sense to a secular materialist but this
starts to not push really hard this

968

starts to not push really hard this
 

969
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,590
starts to not push really hard this
starts to not make sense okay and same

okay you want to
 

1431
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,309
okay you want to
practice a releasing skill okay and you

1432
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
practice a releasing skill okay and you
 

1433
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,829
practice a releasing skill okay and you
have to start from a place of tension

1434
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
have to start from a place of tension
 

1435
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,670
have to start from a place of tension
first okay I I think of it as like a a

Jenga you're going to take tiles
 

1441
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,190
Jenga you're going to take tiles
away that are not necessary for the

and everything else can go to CB it's
 

1471
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,470
and everything else can go to CB it's
not important okay so he's pushing and I

1472
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
not important okay so he's pushing and I
 

1473
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,390
not important okay so he's pushing and I
could be pretty

1474
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
could be pretty
 

1475
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,630
could be pretty
relaxed and as you get more skilled you

1476
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:37,640
relaxed and as you get more skilled you
 

1477
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,870
relaxed and as you get more skilled you
will uh be even more

1478
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
will uh be even more
 

1479
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,349
will uh be even more
relaxed and less

1480
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
relaxed and less
 

1481
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,549
relaxed and less
movement and you can see H what I feel

1482
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:46,559
movement and you can see H what I feel
 

1483
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,670
movement and you can see H what I feel
is like oh he got me there it triggered

1484
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:50,680
is like oh he got me there it triggered
 

1485
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,109
is like oh he got me there it triggered
my push on him and so that's my skill to

1486
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
my push on him and so that's my skill to
 

1487
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,069
my push on him and so that's my skill to
releasing

1488
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:57,079
releasing
 

1489
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,950

not releasing it this way you could but

1490
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
not releasing it this way you could but
 

1491
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,910
not releasing it this way you could but
internal release it relax

1492
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
internal release it relax
 

1493
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:14,630
internal release it relax
it he'll push it'll trigger ah

1494
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640

 

1495
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,589
