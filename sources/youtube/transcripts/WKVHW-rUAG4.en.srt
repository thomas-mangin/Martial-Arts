00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,190

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,200
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,269
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about not walking

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:06,279
going to talk about not walking
 

5
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:09,110
going to talk about not walking
backwards. So, this actually came from

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
backwards. So, this actually came from
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,669
backwards. So, this actually came from
one of the patrons. Um, they showed me a

8
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
one of the patrons. Um, they showed me a
 

9
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,910
one of the patrons. Um, they showed me a
video of them doing geioaza and I was

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
video of them doing geioaza and I was
 

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,430
video of them doing geioaza and I was
saying, "Oh, I think you it looks pretty

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
saying, "Oh, I think you it looks pretty
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,950
saying, "Oh, I think you it looks pretty
good, but you you move backwards more

14
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
good, but you you move backwards more
 

15
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,109
good, but you you move backwards more
than I would like to see and he wanted

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
than I would like to see and he wanted
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,710
than I would like to see and he wanted
to be filled in a little more on what I

18
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
to be filled in a little more on what I
 

19
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,230
to be filled in a little more on what I
meant by that." So, I'm going to talk

20
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
meant by that." So, I'm going to talk
 

21
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,990
meant by that." So, I'm going to talk
about that. I think this is a really

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
about that. I think this is a really
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,589
about that. I think this is a really
complex problem. So when I was doing uh

24
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
complex problem. So when I was doing uh
 

25
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,230
complex problem. So when I was doing uh
Iikido as a student uh well as

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
Iikido as a student uh well as
 

27
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,790
Iikido as a student uh well as
exclusively a student I had a teacher

28
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
exclusively a student I had a teacher
 

29
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,549
exclusively a student I had a teacher
who did lots of geowaza lots and lots of

30
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
who did lots of geowaza lots and lots of
 

31
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,229
who did lots of geowaza lots and lots of
geoa and we had a very big mat and so I

32
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
geoa and we had a very big mat and so I
 

33
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,470
geoa and we had a very big mat and so I
developed what I later called big mat

34
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
developed what I later called big mat
 

35
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,950
developed what I later called big mat
iikido uh and it's a kind of iikido that

36
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
iikido uh and it's a kind of iikido that
 

37
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,310
iikido uh and it's a kind of iikido that
can be done when you got a big mat

38
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
can be done when you got a big mat
 

39
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,549
can be done when you got a big mat
because you can run backwards a long way

40
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
because you can run backwards a long way
 

41
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,389
because you can run backwards a long way
and when people aren't actually pursuing

42
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
and when people aren't actually pursuing
 

43
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,229
and when people aren't actually pursuing
you like they're pursuing you to do

44
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
you like they're pursuing you to do
 

45
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,150
you like they're pursuing you to do
techniques you can get away with it but

46
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
techniques you can get away with it but
 

47
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,310
techniques you can get away with it but
as I worked on a small mat so once I

48
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
as I worked on a small mat so once I
 

49
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,069
as I worked on a small mat so once I
started teaching my garage. It didn't

50
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
started teaching my garage. It didn't
 

51
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,590
started teaching my garage. It didn't
work anymore because I just didn't have

52
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
work anymore because I just didn't have
 

53
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,670
work anymore because I just didn't have
that kind of room. And because I didn't

54
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
that kind of room. And because I didn't
 

55
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,270
that kind of room. And because I didn't
have that kind of room and I had more

56
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
have that kind of room and I had more
 

57
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,790
have that kind of room and I had more
aggressive attackers because in the

58
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
aggressive attackers because in the
 

59
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,910
aggressive attackers because in the
garage we were just beating each other

60
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
garage we were just beating each other
 

61
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,149
garage we were just beating each other
up. Um I started to realize that like

62
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
up. Um I started to realize that like
 

63
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,310
up. Um I started to realize that like
walking backwards is actually horrible.

64
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
walking backwards is actually horrible.
 

65
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,550
walking backwards is actually horrible.
Horrible. And so I developed a way to

66
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
Horrible. And so I developed a way to
 

67
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,750
Horrible. And so I developed a way to
talk about it. So I'm going to share

68
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
talk about it. So I'm going to share
 

69
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,190
talk about it. So I'm going to share
that with you now. I'm going to get Josh

70
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
that with you now. I'm going to get Josh
 

71
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,590
that with you now. I'm going to get Josh
over here. We're going to go to work.

72
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:18,600

 

73
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,749

Josh. All right. So let's talk about not

74
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
Josh. All right. So let's talk about not
 

75
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,910
Josh. All right. So let's talk about not
moving backwards and what that means.

76
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
moving backwards and what that means.
 

77
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,710
moving backwards and what that means.
Um, so in Iikido's schools, I think a

78
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
Um, so in Iikido's schools, I think a
 

79
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,550
Um, so in Iikido's schools, I think a
lot of people move backwards. The school

80
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
lot of people move backwards. The school
 

81
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,990
lot of people move backwards. The school
I came from was really bad about this.

82
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
I came from was really bad about this.
 

83
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,350
I came from was really bad about this.
And that's not that the teacher wasn't

84
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
And that's not that the teacher wasn't
 

85
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,429
And that's not that the teacher wasn't
saying stop moving backwards. He was,

86
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
saying stop moving backwards. He was,
 

87
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,069
saying stop moving backwards. He was,
but I I don't think he put the the

88
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
but I I don't think he put the the
 

89
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,230
but I I don't think he put the the
amount of emphasis on it that I do. Um,

90
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
amount of emphasis on it that I do. Um,
 

91
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,910
amount of emphasis on it that I do. Um,
and I think most schools don't because

92
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
and I think most schools don't because
 

93
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,550
and I think most schools don't because
they don't understand how bad it truly

94
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
they don't understand how bad it truly
 

95
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,190
they don't understand how bad it truly
is to move backwards. So, first of all,

96
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
is to move backwards. So, first of all,
 

97
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,950
is to move backwards. So, first of all,
if I was going to go with Josh, this is

98
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
if I was going to go with Josh, this is
 

99
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,910
if I was going to go with Josh, this is
what I'm basically talking about.

100
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
what I'm basically talking about.
 

101
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,350
what I'm basically talking about.
Actually, I'll do it. So, let's say Josh

102
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
Actually, I'll do it. So, let's say Josh
 

103
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,109
Actually, I'll do it. So, let's say Josh
comes with me and I blend. Okay? And

104
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
comes with me and I blend. Okay? And
 

105
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,389
comes with me and I blend. Okay? And
then Josh starts coming to me again. I'm

106
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
then Josh starts coming to me again. I'm
 

107
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,590
then Josh starts coming to me again. I'm
like, "Oh, I'm not ready to blend, so

108
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
like, "Oh, I'm not ready to blend, so
 

109
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,030
like, "Oh, I'm not ready to blend, so
let me get set." Boom. And so I see

110
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
let me get set." Boom. And so I see
 

111
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,709
let me get set." Boom. And so I see
where I'm walking backwards right there.

112
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
where I'm walking backwards right there.
 

113
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,149
where I'm walking backwards right there.
Okay. And that's really common,

114
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
Okay. And that's really common,
 

115
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,190
Okay. And that's really common,
especially when you get multiple

116
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
especially when you get multiple
 

117
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,789
especially when you get multiple
attackers and like someone feels like

118
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
attackers and like someone feels like
 

119
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,069
attackers and like someone feels like
they're in a position that they're like,

120
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
they're in a position that they're like,
 

121
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,749
they're in a position that they're like,
"I don't really know how to deal with

122
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
"I don't really know how to deal with
 

123
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,030
"I don't really know how to deal with
this position right now. So I need to

124
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
this position right now. So I need to
 

125
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,949
this position right now. So I need to
give myself some room so I can compute

126
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
give myself some room so I can compute
 

127
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,229
give myself some room so I can compute
how to deal with it and then I'll

128
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
how to deal with it and then I'll
 

129
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,630
how to deal with it and then I'll
engage." Okay? It's really horrible and

130
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
engage." Okay? It's really horrible and
 

131
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,110
engage." Okay? It's really horrible and
it's diminishing returns. So, first of

132
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
it's diminishing returns. So, first of
 

133
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,589
it's diminishing returns. So, first of
all, if I'm going after Josh and Josh is

134
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
all, if I'm going after Josh and Josh is
 

135
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,630
all, if I'm going after Josh and Josh is
going backwards, Josh moves slower

136
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
going backwards, Josh moves slower
 

137
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,949
going backwards, Josh moves slower
backwards than I go forward, right?

138
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
backwards than I go forward, right?
 

139
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,430
backwards than I go forward, right?
Okay. If you're in doubt of that, see if

140
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
Okay. If you're in doubt of that, see if
 

141
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,430
Okay. If you're in doubt of that, see if
any track and field event anyone has

142
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
any track and field event anyone has
 

143
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,990
any track and field event anyone has
ever run a sprint backwards, right? Has

144
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
ever run a sprint backwards, right? Has
 

145
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,910
ever run a sprint backwards, right? Has
anyone ever tried that? Because if it's

146
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
anyone ever tried that? Because if it's
 

147
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,509
anyone ever tried that? Because if it's
a fast way to run, then maybe people

148
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
a fast way to run, then maybe people
 

149
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,710
a fast way to run, then maybe people
should be running that way. But they

150
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
should be running that way. But they
 

151
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,830
should be running that way. But they
don't, you know? And when I say that,

152
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
don't, you know? And when I say that,
 

153
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,350
don't, you know? And when I say that,
you probably laugh because it's stupid,

154
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
you probably laugh because it's stupid,
 

155
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,430
you probably laugh because it's stupid,
right? Like, you know that you can't run

156
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
right? Like, you know that you can't run
 

157
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,869
right? Like, you know that you can't run
backwards nearly as fast you can run

158
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
backwards nearly as fast you can run
 

159
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,270
backwards nearly as fast you can run
forward. Even in the NFL where there's a

160
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
forward. Even in the NFL where there's a
 

161
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,070
forward. Even in the NFL where there's a
guy who's several guys whose job is

162
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
guy who's several guys whose job is
 

163
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,229
guy who's several guys whose job is
specifically to run backwards, they

164
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
specifically to run backwards, they
 

165
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,949
specifically to run backwards, they
can't run backwards as fast as the the

166
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
can't run backwards as fast as the the
 

167
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,710
can't run backwards as fast as the the
guys who can run forward at their level

168
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
guys who can run forward at their level
 

169
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,869
guys who can run forward at their level
can run forward, right? So, you just

170
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
can run forward, right? So, you just
 

171
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,710
can run forward, right? So, you just
can't run backwards as fast you can run

172
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
can't run backwards as fast you can run
 

173
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,470
can't run backwards as fast you can run
forwards. So, if he's trying to buy

174
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
forwards. So, if he's trying to buy
 

175
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,710
forwards. So, if he's trying to buy
himself time, he's actually not. He's

176
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
himself time, he's actually not. He's
 

177
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,309
himself time, he's actually not. He's
just kind of more slow. I mean, you can

178
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
just kind of more slow. I mean, you can
 

179
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,070
just kind of more slow. I mean, you can
see he's buying time. He's more slowly

180
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
see he's buying time. He's more slowly
 

181
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,550
see he's buying time. He's more slowly
losing time, but it's still diminishing,

182
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
losing time, but it's still diminishing,
 

183
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,790
losing time, but it's still diminishing,
right? Never going to get okay. you are

184
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
right? Never going to get okay. you are
 

185
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,949
right? Never going to get okay. you are
not in a position to receive force when

186
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
not in a position to receive force when
 

187
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,550
not in a position to receive force when
you're headed backwards because the

188
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
you're headed backwards because the
 

189
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,710
you're headed backwards because the
problem with it is as he goes backwards

190
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
problem with it is as he goes backwards
 

191
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,790
problem with it is as he goes backwards
if I shove him he's already headed in

192
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
if I shove him he's already headed in
 

193
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,190
if I shove him he's already headed in
that direction. So his pinchant is to

194
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
that direction. So his pinchant is to
 

195
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,630
that direction. So his pinchant is to
continue moving in that direction just

196
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
continue moving in that direction just
 

197
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,949
continue moving in that direction just
faster. So if someone smashes into you,

198
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
faster. So if someone smashes into you,
 

199
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,550
faster. So if someone smashes into you,
you can't brace, you can't anything,

200
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
you can't brace, you can't anything,
 

201
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,830
you can't brace, you can't anything,
right? So you might be able to turn and

202
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
right? So you might be able to turn and
 

203
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,750
right? So you might be able to turn and
roll, which is why we learn to roll, but

204
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
roll, which is why we learn to roll, but
 

205
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,110
roll, which is why we learn to roll, but
it's that's not going to be that good

206
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
it's that's not going to be that good
 

207
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,149
it's that's not going to be that good
for you. Josh cannot see behind himself

208
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
for you. Josh cannot see behind himself
 

209
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,390
for you. Josh cannot see behind himself
as well as I can see in front of myself,

210
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
as well as I can see in front of myself,
 

211
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,149
as well as I can see in front of myself,
right? And this is another obvious one.

212
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
right? And this is another obvious one.
 

213
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,670
right? And this is another obvious one.
These things are so obvious that when

214
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
These things are so obvious that when
 

215
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,030
These things are so obvious that when
you say them, people go, "Well, duh."

216
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
you say them, people go, "Well, duh."
 

217
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,070
you say them, people go, "Well, duh."
But they don't really think about what

218
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
But they don't really think about what
 

219
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,589
But they don't really think about what
that means. So, if Josh is moving

220
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
that means. So, if Josh is moving
 

221
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,270
that means. So, if Josh is moving
backwards, he can't see what's back

222
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
backwards, he can't see what's back
 

223
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,110
backwards, he can't see what's back
there and I can see what's over there.

224
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
there and I can see what's over there.
 

225
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,869
there and I can see what's over there.
So, I, if I'm clever, will kind of push

226
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
So, I, if I'm clever, will kind of push
 

227
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,949
So, I, if I'm clever, will kind of push
him to where I want into a corner, into

228
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
him to where I want into a corner, into
 

229
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,710
him to where I want into a corner, into
my friend, off a cliff, whatever it is I

230
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
my friend, off a cliff, whatever it is I
 

231
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,309
my friend, off a cliff, whatever it is I
want. Right? So, it's just inferior to

232
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
want. Right? So, it's just inferior to
 

233
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,390
want. Right? So, it's just inferior to
move backwards. Okay. Now, I understand

234
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
move backwards. Okay. Now, I understand
 

235
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,830
move backwards. Okay. Now, I understand
you want to buy yourself time. So, in a

236
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
you want to buy yourself time. So, in a
 

237
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,949
you want to buy yourself time. So, in a
second, I'm going to tell you how you

238
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
second, I'm going to tell you how you
 

239
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,789
second, I'm going to tell you how you
buy yourself time. Another thing I want

240
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
buy yourself time. Another thing I want
 

241
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,949
buy yourself time. Another thing I want
you to understand is the position of

242
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
you to understand is the position of
 

243
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,710
you to understand is the position of
muhani, which is the position you

244
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
muhani, which is the position you
 

245
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,509
muhani, which is the position you
perpetuate if you go backwards is the

246
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
perpetuate if you go backwards is the
 

247
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,990
perpetuate if you go backwards is the
worst position you can have. Right? So

248
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
worst position you can have. Right? So
 

249
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,670
worst position you can have. Right? So
if I'm like this and I'm coming after

250
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
if I'm like this and I'm coming after
 

251
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,310
if I'm like this and I'm coming after
Josh, he's perpetuating muhan me. Even

252
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
Josh, he's perpetuating muhan me. Even
 

253
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,789
Josh, he's perpetuating muhan me. Even
when I turn, Josh will turn also, right?

254
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
when I turn, Josh will turn also, right?
 

255
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,030
when I turn, Josh will turn also, right?
To deal with this. So it's bad for him.

256
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
To deal with this. So it's bad for him.
 

257
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,189
To deal with this. So it's bad for him.
He's in a bad position. Where Josh wants

258
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
He's in a bad position. Where Josh wants
 

259
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,230
He's in a bad position. Where Josh wants
to be is this way. There's no way he's

260
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
to be is this way. There's no way he's
 

261
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,390
to be is this way. There's no way he's
gonna get this way by walking backwards.

262
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
gonna get this way by walking backwards.
 

263
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,550
gonna get this way by walking backwards.
So he's not positionally improving

264
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
So he's not positionally improving
 

265
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,710
So he's not positionally improving
himself either. So, not only is he

266
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
himself either. So, not only is he
 

267
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,390
himself either. So, not only is he
making distance badly because he can't

268
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
making distance badly because he can't
 

269
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,749
making distance badly because he can't
do it as fast, he can't do it as

270
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
do it as fast, he can't do it as
 

271
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,590
do it as fast, he can't do it as
efficiently, but he also is not

272
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
efficiently, but he also is not
 

273
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,270
efficiently, but he also is not
positionally improving himself either.

274
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
positionally improving himself either.
 

275
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,469
positionally improving himself either.
He's not getting behind me, which is

276
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
He's not getting behind me, which is
 

277
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,310
He's not getting behind me, which is
what he wants to do. So, the answer to

278
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
what he wants to do. So, the answer to
 

279
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,469
what he wants to do. So, the answer to
this is to go forward. Now, that might

280
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
this is to go forward. Now, that might
 

281
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,390
this is to go forward. Now, that might
seem like it's contrary to other things

282
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
seem like it's contrary to other things
 

283
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,110
seem like it's contrary to other things
I've said. But, let me point out two

284
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
I've said. But, let me point out two
 

285
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,150
I've said. But, let me point out two
models for iikido. One is the common

286
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
models for iikido. One is the common
 

287
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,310
models for iikido. One is the common
model used and one's the model I more

288
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
model used and one's the model I more
 

289
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,150
model used and one's the model I more
regularly use at my school. Both models

290
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
regularly use at my school. Both models
 

291
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,350
regularly use at my school. Both models
are applicable and there's times for

292
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
are applicable and there's times for
 

293
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,710
are applicable and there's times for
both models, but let me just point out

294
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
both models, but let me just point out
 

295
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,270
both models, but let me just point out
that there are two models. One model is

296
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
that there are two models. One model is
 

297
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,110
that there are two models. One model is
as the Iikido guy, Josh stands there and

298
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
as the Iikido guy, Josh stands there and
 

299
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,110
as the Iikido guy, Josh stands there and
when I come at Josh, he does technique,

300
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
when I come at Josh, he does technique,
 

301
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,270
when I come at Josh, he does technique,
right? So I come at Josh and he does

302
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
right? So I come at Josh and he does
 

303
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,590
right? So I come at Josh and he does
technique there and I fly through the

304
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
technique there and I fly through the
 

305
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,029
technique there and I fly through the
air, right? Okay, so that's one model

306
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
air, right? Okay, so that's one model
 

307
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,550
air, right? Okay, so that's one model
and that's the model most commonly used,

308
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
and that's the model most commonly used,
 

309
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,510
and that's the model most commonly used,
right? If you look at um teachers uh at

310
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
right? If you look at um teachers uh at
 

311
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,430
right? If you look at um teachers uh at
demonstrations showing GIA, that's

312
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
demonstrations showing GIA, that's
 

313
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,629
demonstrations showing GIA, that's
basically the model they use. They

314
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
basically the model they use. They
 

315
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,070
basically the model they use. They
pretty much stand still. They might move

316
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
pretty much stand still. They might move
 

317
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,590
pretty much stand still. They might move
a little bit, they pretty much stand

318
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
a little bit, they pretty much stand
 

319
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,070
a little bit, they pretty much stand
still, then the other guy comes to them

320
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
still, then the other guy comes to them
 

321
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,150
still, then the other guy comes to them
and then they they blend with them. If

322
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
and then they they blend with them. If
 

323
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,749
and then they they blend with them. If
you're training exclusively in this

324
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
you're training exclusively in this
 

325
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,510
you're training exclusively in this
model and you can't figure out what to

326
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
model and you can't figure out what to
 

327
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,990
model and you can't figure out what to
do next, of course you walk backwards

328
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
do next, of course you walk backwards
 

329
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,070
do next, of course you walk backwards
because your thought process is I have

330
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
because your thought process is I have
 

331
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,230
because your thought process is I have
to be ahead of them, right? So

332
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
to be ahead of them, right? So
 

333
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,310
to be ahead of them, right? So
understand that Josh is ahead of me

334
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
understand that Josh is ahead of me
 

335
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,230
understand that Josh is ahead of me
because I have to go to Josh to do

336
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
because I have to go to Josh to do
 

337
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,390
because I have to go to Josh to do
something. So Josh thinks I have to be

338
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
something. So Josh thinks I have to be
 

339
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,150
something. So Josh thinks I have to be
ahead of him in order to do the

340
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
ahead of him in order to do the
 

341
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,590
ahead of him in order to do the
technique. So if I don't know what to do

342
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
technique. So if I don't know what to do
 

343
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,510
technique. So if I don't know what to do
right now, I'm going to move to make

344
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
right now, I'm going to move to make
 

345
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,029
right now, I'm going to move to make
sure I stay ahead of him and then when I

346
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
sure I stay ahead of him and then when I
 

347
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,629
sure I stay ahead of him and then when I
figure it out, I'll stop and let him

348
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
figure it out, I'll stop and let him
 

349
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,070
figure it out, I'll stop and let him
catch up to me and then I'll do the

350
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
catch up to me and then I'll do the
 

351
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,870
catch up to me and then I'll do the
technique. Right? But you're losing time

352
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
technique. Right? But you're losing time
 

353
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,629
technique. Right? But you're losing time
in that, right? So, what you need to do

354
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
in that, right? So, what you need to do
 

355
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,710
in that, right? So, what you need to do
is flip the script. Now, let me show you

356
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
is flip the script. Now, let me show you
 

357
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,029
is flip the script. Now, let me show you
another model, right? Okay. So, if Josh

358
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
another model, right? Okay. So, if Josh
 

359
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,909
another model, right? Okay. So, if Josh
is the she, another model could be Josh

360
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
is the she, another model could be Josh
 

361
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,550
is the she, another model could be Josh
coming towards me, moving a direction,

362
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
coming towards me, moving a direction,
 

363
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,230
coming towards me, moving a direction,
and then hitting me, right? So, we'll

364
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
and then hitting me, right? So, we'll
 

365
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,909
and then hitting me, right? So, we'll
switch. I mean, it's confusing, but let

366
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
switch. I mean, it's confusing, but let
 

367
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,350
switch. I mean, it's confusing, but let
me let me switch. Right? So, I'm going

368
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
me let me switch. Right? So, I'm going
 

369
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,790
me let me switch. Right? So, I'm going
to be she. I'm going to be the person

370
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
to be she. I'm going to be the person
 

371
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,909
to be she. I'm going to be the person
doing the technique. So, if we were

372
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
doing the technique. So, if we were
 

373
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,909
doing the technique. So, if we were
doing iikido technique, like shonuchi,

374
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
doing iikido technique, like shonuchi,
 

375
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,270
doing iikido technique, like shonuchi,
right? I'm she. So, I'd be the person

376
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
right? I'm she. So, I'd be the person
 

377
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,070
right? I'm she. So, I'd be the person
doing shunuchi. Okay? So look, I'm going

378
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
doing shunuchi. Okay? So look, I'm going
 

379
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,070
doing shunuchi. Okay? So look, I'm going
here and there's a guy in my way. And I

380
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
here and there's a guy in my way. And I
 

381
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
here and there's a guy in my way. And I
go to the side because I don't want to

382
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
go to the side because I don't want to
 

383
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,950
go to the side because I don't want to
deal with this guy. And I attack him

384
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
deal with this guy. And I attack him
 

385
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,390
deal with this guy. And I attack him
here. Now we're in the Shomonucci

386
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
here. Now we're in the Shomonucci
 

387
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,870
here. Now we're in the Shomonucci
position from before. And the model is

388
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
position from before. And the model is
 

389
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,350
position from before. And the model is
she is moving. It's not UK that's

390
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
she is moving. It's not UK that's
 

391
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,629
she is moving. It's not UK that's
moving. Right? So do you see these two

392
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
moving. Right? So do you see these two
 

393
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,070
moving. Right? So do you see these two
models? It could be confusing, but think

394
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
models? It could be confusing, but think
 

395
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,670
models? It could be confusing, but think
about this for a second. Let's make Josh

396
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
about this for a second. Let's make Josh
 

397
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,309
about this for a second. Let's make Josh
she in both cases. Either in one case

398
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
she in both cases. Either in one case
 

399
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,629
she in both cases. Either in one case
she is standing still and UK is going to

400
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
she is standing still and UK is going to
 

401
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,430
she is standing still and UK is going to
she and then she does the technique. The

402
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
she and then she does the technique. The
 

403
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,629
she and then she does the technique. The
other situation is she is coming to UK

404
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
other situation is she is coming to UK
 

405
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,029
other situation is she is coming to UK
getting offline and doing the technique.

406
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
getting offline and doing the technique.
 

407
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,270
getting offline and doing the technique.
Right? Make sense? Two different models.

408
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
Right? Make sense? Two different models.
 

409
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,909
Right? Make sense? Two different models.
If we understand the second model, if we

410
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
If we understand the second model, if we
 

411
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,189
If we understand the second model, if we
understand that model, we understand

412
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
understand that model, we understand
 

413
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,189
understand that model, we understand
what to do in situations where we can't

414
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
what to do in situations where we can't
 

415
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,589
what to do in situations where we can't
process what to do because what you do

416
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
process what to do because what you do
 

417
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,150
process what to do because what you do
is very simple. You don't go straight at

418
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
is very simple. You don't go straight at
 

419
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,550
is very simple. You don't go straight at
them. You go forward at an angle. That's

420
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
them. You go forward at an angle. That's
 

421
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,350
them. You go forward at an angle. That's
what you do, right? So, think if I'm she

422
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
what you do, right? So, think if I'm she
 

423
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,909
what you do, right? So, think if I'm she
I'm in a room. I want to get out of the

424
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
I'm in a room. I want to get out of the
 

425
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,670
I'm in a room. I want to get out of the
room, right? Josh is going to rape me or

426
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
room, right? Josh is going to rape me or
 

427
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,430
room, right? Josh is going to rape me or
something terrible. I don't want that,

428
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
something terrible. I don't want that,
 

429
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,270
something terrible. I don't want that,
right? So, when I know he's going to do

430
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
right? So, when I know he's going to do
 

431
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,790
right? So, when I know he's going to do
that, I got to get out of the room. So,

432
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
that, I got to get out of the room. So,
 

433
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,909
that, I got to get out of the room. So,
what am I going to do? Well, I'm not

434
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
what am I going to do? Well, I'm not
 

435
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,790
what am I going to do? Well, I'm not
going to run at him and fight him

436
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
going to run at him and fight him
 

437
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,909
going to run at him and fight him
because I'm scared this guy's going to

438
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
because I'm scared this guy's going to
 

439
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,350
because I'm scared this guy's going to
do something bad to me, right? So, what

440
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
do something bad to me, right? So, what
 

441
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,589
do something bad to me, right? So, what
I do, I cut an angle and I try and get

442
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
I do, I cut an angle and I try and get
 

443
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,189
I do, I cut an angle and I try and get
past him. Now, what's Josh going to do

444
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
past him. Now, what's Josh going to do
 

445
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,629
past him. Now, what's Josh going to do
when I cut an angle? Well, he's going to

446
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
when I cut an angle? Well, he's going to
 

447
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,309
when I cut an angle? Well, he's going to
cut an angle towards me. So, what do I

448
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
cut an angle towards me. So, what do I
 

449
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,070
cut an angle towards me. So, what do I
do? I cut an angle. Can I cut a sharp

450
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
do? I cut an angle. Can I cut a sharp
 

451
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,990
do? I cut an angle. Can I cut a sharp
one this way? If he shoots too much this

452
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
one this way? If he shoots too much this
 

453
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,670
one this way? If he shoots too much this
way, then I cut an angle back this way.

454
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
way, then I cut an angle back this way.
 

455
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,710
way, then I cut an angle back this way.
Right? So that model tells you what to

456
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
Right? So that model tells you what to
 

457
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,510
Right? So that model tells you what to
do in the going backward situation. And

458
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
do in the going backward situation. And
 

459
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,670
do in the going backward situation. And
why it's good is because you start

460
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
why it's good is because you start
 

461
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,909
why it's good is because you start
dictating to them what to do and you're

462
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
dictating to them what to do and you're
 

463
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,469
dictating to them what to do and you're
still ahead. Now look, in my theory of

464
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
still ahead. Now look, in my theory of
 

465
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,070
still ahead. Now look, in my theory of
Iikido, I tell you aheadedness is the

466
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
Iikido, I tell you aheadedness is the
 

467
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,390
Iikido, I tell you aheadedness is the
number one. Now, one way to see ahead is

468
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
number one. Now, one way to see ahead is
 

469
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,550
number one. Now, one way to see ahead is
if Josh is she and he's just standing

470
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
if Josh is she and he's just standing
 

471
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,869
if Josh is she and he's just standing
there, I come to him. So Josh is ahead

472
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
there, I come to him. So Josh is ahead
 

473
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,390
there, I come to him. So Josh is ahead
of me because I've got a I'm being

474
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
of me because I've got a I'm being
 

475
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,790
of me because I've got a I'm being
dictated to Josh as to where to go.

476
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
dictated to Josh as to where to go.
 

477
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,550
dictated to Josh as to where to go.
Okay. The other way that can happen

478
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
Okay. The other way that can happen
 

479
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,189
Okay. The other way that can happen
though is Josh cuts an angle. The second

480
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
though is Josh cuts an angle. The second
 

481
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,629
though is Josh cuts an angle. The second
he cut an angle, do you see he's ahead

482
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
he cut an angle, do you see he's ahead
 

483
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,309
he cut an angle, do you see he's ahead
of me? Because I had to shift to deal

484
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
of me? Because I had to shift to deal
 

485
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,550
of me? Because I had to shift to deal
with Josh. So, he's still ahead of me.

486
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
with Josh. So, he's still ahead of me.
 

487
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,309
with Josh. So, he's still ahead of me.
And so, when you're walking backwards,

488
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
And so, when you're walking backwards,
 

489
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,309
And so, when you're walking backwards,
you're no longer ahead because I know

490
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
you're no longer ahead because I know
 

491
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,070
you're no longer ahead because I know
where you are. I just takes me the time

492
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
where you are. I just takes me the time
 

493
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,189
where you are. I just takes me the time
to get there, right? So, your

494
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
to get there, right? So, your
 

495
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,790
to get there, right? So, your
aheadedness is diminishing. You're

496
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
aheadedness is diminishing. You're
 

497
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,230
aheadedness is diminishing. You're
losing the aheadedness. And you're kind

498
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
losing the aheadedness. And you're kind
 

499
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,909
losing the aheadedness. And you're kind
of just putting off the inevitable. So,

500
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
of just putting off the inevitable. So,
 

501
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,749
of just putting off the inevitable. So,
you really don't want to move backwards

502
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
you really don't want to move backwards
 

503
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,110
you really don't want to move backwards
for all those reasons. You don't make as

504
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
for all those reasons. You don't make as
 

505
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,029
for all those reasons. You don't make as
much power that way. You can't see that

506
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
much power that way. You can't see that
 

507
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,869
much power that way. You can't see that
way. You're not getting positionally

508
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
way. You're not getting positionally
 

509
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,710
way. You're not getting positionally
advantageous. You're not as fast that

510
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
advantageous. You're not as fast that
 

511
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,709
advantageous. You're not as fast that
way. So, all those things are bad. So,

512
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
way. So, all those things are bad. So,
 

513
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,790
way. So, all those things are bad. So,
what do you do in a situation where you

514
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
what do you do in a situation where you
 

515
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,350
what do you do in a situation where you
can't figure out what to do? You go at

516
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
can't figure out what to do? You go at
 

517
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,589
can't figure out what to do? You go at
them at an angle, right? So, all I do is

518
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
them at an angle, right? So, all I do is
 

519
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,029
them at an angle, right? So, all I do is
I go, sh I can't figure out where to go

520
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
I go, sh I can't figure out where to go
 

521
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,630
I go, sh I can't figure out where to go
and I go here and I go, here's the empty

522
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
and I go here and I go, here's the empty
 

523
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,230
and I go here and I go, here's the empty
space and I walk towards the empty space

524
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
space and I walk towards the empty space
 

525
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,430
space and I walk towards the empty space
and that's how I get out of there.

526
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
and that's how I get out of there.
 

527
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,350
and that's how I get out of there.
Right? So, if you're in a situation

528
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
Right? So, if you're in a situation
 

529
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,949
Right? So, if you're in a situation
where you don't know what to do, you go

530
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
where you don't know what to do, you go
 

531
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,110
where you don't know what to do, you go
at them and you cut an angle. If they

532
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
at them and you cut an angle. If they
 

533
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,470
at them and you cut an angle. If they
make a wide angle, you cut the other

534
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
make a wide angle, you cut the other
 

535
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,389
make a wide angle, you cut the other
angle. And that's as simple as it goes.

536
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
angle. And that's as simple as it goes.
 

537
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,150
angle. And that's as simple as it goes.
And then you can strike them in that.

538
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
And then you can strike them in that.
 

539
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,990
And then you can strike them in that.
So, as I cut the angle, I hit him. Now,

540
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
So, as I cut the angle, I hit him. Now,
 

541
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,350
So, as I cut the angle, I hit him. Now,
I've dictated him what to do. You better

542
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
I've dictated him what to do. You better
 

543
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,470
I've dictated him what to do. You better
bring up your hands. I'll hit you in the

544
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
bring up your hands. I'll hit you in the
 

545
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,509
bring up your hands. I'll hit you in the
head. If I hit them in the head, that's

546
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
head. If I hit them in the head, that's
 

547
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,030
head. If I hit them in the head, that's
cool. That's good technique. If not,

548
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
cool. That's good technique. If not,
 

549
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,110
cool. That's good technique. If not,
I've got shomonuchi eekyo through roio

550
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
I've got shomonuchi eekyo through roio
 

551
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,310
I've got shomonuchi eekyo through roio
and all the other things that come from

552
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
and all the other things that come from
 

553
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,870
and all the other things that come from
that. Right? So, this is another way to

554
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
that. Right? So, this is another way to
 

555
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,630
that. Right? So, this is another way to
get your techniques coming off again

556
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
get your techniques coming off again
 

557
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,829
get your techniques coming off again
when you find yourself walking

558
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
when you find yourself walking
 

559
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,150
when you find yourself walking
backwards. Don't walk backwards. You

560
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
backwards. Don't walk backwards. You
 

561
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,590
backwards. Don't walk backwards. You
should always be trying to get to the

562
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
should always be trying to get to the
 

563
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,829
should always be trying to get to the
position where you're most advantageous.

564
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
position where you're most advantageous.
 

565
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,269
position where you're most advantageous.
If you were in a locked in room, that

566
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
If you were in a locked in room, that
 

567
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,470
If you were in a locked in room, that
would always be the center of the room

568
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
would always be the center of the room
 

569
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,750
would always be the center of the room
because then they can't lock you against

570
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
because then they can't lock you against
 

571
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,509
because then they can't lock you against
a wall. If you're in a room that's got

572
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
a wall. If you're in a room that's got
 

573
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,350
a wall. If you're in a room that's got
an exit, it's always moving towards the

574
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
an exit, it's always moving towards the
 

575
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,350
an exit, it's always moving towards the
exit, right? So, that's always what

576
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
exit, right? So, that's always what
 

577
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,949
exit, right? So, that's always what
you're working. If there's obstacles,

578
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
you're working. If there's obstacles,
 

579
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,470
you're working. If there's obstacles,
you're working. So, you put the obstacle

580
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
you're working. So, you put the obstacle
 

581
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,070
you're working. So, you put the obstacle
between you and them. So, if there was a

582
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
between you and them. So, if there was a
 

583
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,509
between you and them. So, if there was a
table right there and Josh was after me,

584
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
table right there and Josh was after me,
 

585
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,350
table right there and Josh was after me,
I'd run over to this side of the table.

586
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
I'd run over to this side of the table.
 

587
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,350
I'd run over to this side of the table.
So, the table is in between me and Josh,

588
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
So, the table is in between me and Josh,
 

589
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,190
So, the table is in between me and Josh,
right? So, that's always the way I'm

590
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
right? So, that's always the way I'm
 

591
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,949
right? So, that's always the way I'm
thinking when I'm moving. I don't want

592
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
thinking when I'm moving. I don't want
 

593
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,310
thinking when I'm moving. I don't want
to move backwards. Now, we will move

594
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
to move backwards. Now, we will move
 

595
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,670
to move backwards. Now, we will move
backwards sometimes because we get

596
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
backwards sometimes because we get
 

597
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,269
backwards sometimes because we get
caught and there's no way around it, but

598
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
caught and there's no way around it, but
 

599
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,310
caught and there's no way around it, but
ideally, no backwards movement. So, I

600
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
ideally, no backwards movement. So, I
 

601
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,310
ideally, no backwards movement. So, I
hope this sus some things out for you.

602
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
hope this sus some things out for you.
 

603
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,070
hope this sus some things out for you.
Uh, I'm Christopher Hines. Joshua Tehi.

604
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
Uh, I'm Christopher Hines. Joshua Tehi.
 

605
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,750
Uh, I'm Christopher Hines. Joshua Tehi.
My Solar McDaniel's behind that camera

606
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
My Solar McDaniel's behind that camera
 

607
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,269
My Solar McDaniel's behind that camera
right there, and we'll see you in the
