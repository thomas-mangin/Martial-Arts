33
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,270
is going to make um in tai chi they it's
like a bird's beak

34
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
like a bird's beak
 

35
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,709
like a bird's beak
it's a bird's beak so i'm going to put

36
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
it's a bird's beak so i'm going to put
 

37
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,069
it's a bird's beak so i'm going to put
all my fingers together

38
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
all my fingers together
 

39
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,110
all my fingers together
now turning on my cheek

40
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
now turning on my cheek
 

41
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,630
now turning on my cheek
but i can't move him so i can't move it

42
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
but i can't move him so i can't move it
 

43
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,430
but i can't move him so i can't move it
a centimeter my buttock

44
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
a centimeter my buttock
 

45
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,670
a centimeter my buttock
turns as the bird beat turns i don't

46
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
turns as the bird beat turns i don't
 

47
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,830
turns as the bird beat turns i don't
know how many people can see it but if i

48
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
know how many people can see it but if i
 

49
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,910
know how many people can see it but if i
keep there it's starting to come out at

50
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
keep there it's starting to come out at
 

51
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,709
keep there it's starting to come out at
that time this hand needs to have crept

52
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
that time this hand needs to have crept
 

53
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,469
that time this hand needs to have crept
over to there

54
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
over to there
 

55
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,710
over to there
so now it's keyhole because i've got one

56
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
so now it's keyhole because i've got one
 

57
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,429
so now it's keyhole because i've got one
hand on it now i can make it come out i

58
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
hand on it now i can make it come out i
 

59
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,469
hand on it now i can make it come out i
mustn't make it come out until then now

60
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
mustn't make it come out until then now
 

61
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,550
mustn't make it come out until then now
this hand's going to come here and if i

62
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
this hand's going to come here and if i
 

63
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,469
this hand's going to come here and if i
had a cane to cut

64
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
had a cane to cut
 

65
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,429
had a cane to cut
cut

66
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
cut
 

67
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,190
cut
him

68
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
him
 

69
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,710
him
that would do that and that's where i'd

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
that would do that and that's where i'd
 

71
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,749
that would do that and that's where i'd
end up

72
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759

 

73
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,749

it's the same as the category one

74
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
it's the same as the category one
 

75
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,230
it's the same as the category one
i can do this one it doesn't matter

76
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
i can do this one it doesn't matter
 

77
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,710
i can do this one it doesn't matter
if i have a um an open hand let's go

78
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
if i have a um an open hand let's go
 

79
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,670
if i have a um an open hand let's go
this way

80
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
this way
 

81
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,870
this way
if i have an open hand

82
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
if i have an open hand
 

83
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,870
if i have an open hand
it's difficult to turn it if i make a

84
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
it's difficult to turn it if i make a
 

85
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,149
it's difficult to turn it if i make a
bird's beak

86
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159

 

87
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,550

it's easier

88
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
it's easier
 

89
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,510
it's easier
if it comes out before i've got my hands

90
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
if it comes out before i've got my hands
 

91
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,710
if it comes out before i've got my hands
closed

92
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
closed
 

93
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,389
closed
then it's not kihon

94
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
then it's not kihon
 

95
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,109
then it's not kihon
and he can take his hand away

96
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119

 

97
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,550

so

98
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
so
 

99
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,709
so
we've got another technique for that

100
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
we've got another technique for that
 

101
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,630
we've got another technique for that
so bird's beak

102
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
so bird's beak
 

103
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,040
so bird's beak
turn

104
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,050
turn
 

105
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,190
turn

it comes out too quick he takes his hand

108
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
it comes out too quick he takes his hand
 

109
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,070
it comes out too quick he takes his hand
away never mind

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080

 

111
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,350

all right so there's always another

112
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
all right so there's always another
 

113
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,790
all right so there's always another
technique

114
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
technique
 

115
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,030
technique
so if you find you mess up do the uremi

116
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040

 

117
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,470

bird speak

118
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480

 

119
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390

if you think about it let go

120
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
if you think about it let go
 

121
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,229
if you think about it let go
if you think about it

122
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239

 

123
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,830

you perhaps didn't see that

124
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
you perhaps didn't see that
 

125
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,509
you perhaps didn't see that
earlier the camera were left so i can't

126
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
earlier the camera were left so i can't
 

127
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,470
earlier the camera were left so i can't
lie i didn't go like that

128
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
lie i didn't go like that
 

129
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,790
lie i didn't go like that
i actually went

130
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
i actually went
 

131
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,030
i actually went
i said that thumb goes over there and i

132
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
i said that thumb goes over there and i
 

133
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,790
i said that thumb goes over there and i
was closing my hand up because i know i

134
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
was closing my hand up because i know i
 

135
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,309
was closing my hand up because i know i
was

137
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,190

all right

138
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
all right
 

139
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,270
all right
so all right so there's a piece more to

140
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
so all right so there's a piece more to
 

141
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,350
so all right so there's a piece more to
add to it the bird's beak

142
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
add to it the bird's beak
 

143
