00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:37,800

 

905
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,470

down so let's say lean

906
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:43,480

 

907
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,710

backwards you see that and you're like

908
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
backwards you see that and you're like
 

909
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,510
backwards you see that and you're like
how do I he's too tall for me so you

910
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:50,520
how do I he's too tall for me so you
 

911
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,270
how do I he's too tall for me so you
want more angle down you see that your

912
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:54,280
want more angle down you see that your
 

913
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,750
want more angle down you see that your
solution is this one some variation of

914
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:56,760
solution is this one some variation of
 

915
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,589

that
 

917
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,190
that
okay so you kind just move him move

918
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200

 

919
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,750

him you get that you understand okay

him you get that you understand okay
 

921
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,829
him you get that you understand okay
you're like oh we stopped moving okay

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
cool you
 

925
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,430
cool you
see then end the technique right or that

926
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:16,440
see then end the technique right or that
 

927
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,870
see then end the technique right or that
time where go ahead get up and you're

928
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:18,880
time where go ahead get up and you're

okay
cool in the technique okay

934
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640

 

935
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,430

okay try it

936
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,440

 

937
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:59,430

then
 

993
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:46,950
then
lower energy

994
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:46,960
