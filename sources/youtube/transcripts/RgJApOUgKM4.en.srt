3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,190

I'll go slow enough and I'll tell you

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
I'll go slow enough and I'll tell you
 

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,150
I'll go slow enough and I'll tell you
where to Mark is

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,160
where to Mark is
 

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,029
where to Mark is
okay um so we know at some point in E

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:18,039
okay um so we know at some point in E
 

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,509
okay um so we know at some point in E
right that I'm going to do the inward

10
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:21,519
right that I'm going to do the inward
 

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,390
right that I'm going to do the inward
spiral right

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:25,400
spiral right
 

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,870
spiral right
okay and it we know it looks like that

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
okay and it we know it looks like that
 

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,990
okay and it we know it looks like that
okay all right so if

16
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
okay all right so if
 

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,270
okay all right so if
I go here and let's mark where his

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
I go here and let's mark where his
 

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,229
I go here and let's mark where his
shoulder is in the vertical plane and

20
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:41,239
shoulder is in the vertical plane and
 

21
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,869
shoulder is in the vertical plane and
let's mark where my shoulder is in the

22
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:43,879
let's mark where my shoulder is in the
 

23
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,189
let's mark where my shoulder is in the
vertical

24
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:45,199
vertical
 

25
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,389
vertical
plane you see I see this okay so if I if

26
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:49,399
plane you see I see this okay so if I if
 

27
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,029
plane you see I see this okay so if I if
he just keeps his grip and I do the same

28
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
he just keeps his grip and I do the same
 

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,110
he just keeps his grip and I do the same
spiral you can see what's happening to

30
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,120
spiral you can see what's happening to
 

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,270
spiral you can see what's happening to
don't don't do don't game anything right

32
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,280
don't don't do don't game anything right
 

33
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,830
don't don't do don't game anything right
now you can see how it's going up his

34
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:00,840
now you can see how it's going up his
 

35
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,590
now you can see how it's going up his
arm you feel it in the into his shoulder

36
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:04,600
arm you feel it in the into his shoulder
 

37
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,070
arm you feel it in the into his shoulder
and staying at his wrist you see

38
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,080
and staying at his wrist you see
 

39
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,149
and staying at his wrist you see
that you guys see that

40
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:13,159
that you guys see that
 

41
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,710
that you guys see that
okay I'll do it again and you'll see any

42
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
okay I'll do it again and you'll see any
 

43
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,670
okay I'll do it again and you'll see any
anytime his shoulder is on that side of

44
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:20,680
anytime his shoulder is on that side of
 

45
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,870
anytime his shoulder is on that side of
the Sagal plane to my

46
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
the Sagal plane to my
 

47
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,990
the Sagal plane to my
shoulder that's what's going to happen

48
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,000
shoulder that's what's going to happen
 

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,230
shoulder that's what's going to happen
so I'll bring him even closer

50
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
so I'll bring him even closer
 

51
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,870
so I'll bring him even closer
got it but we mark it and we Mark where

52
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
got it but we mark it and we Mark where
 

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,190
got it but we mark it and we Mark where
I am and you see it again it goes up the

54
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
I am and you see it again it goes up the
 

55
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,630
I am and you see it again it goes up the
arm into the

56
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
arm into the
 

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,310
arm into the
shoulder let's say I'm I'm here and I'm

58
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,320
shoulder let's say I'm I'm here and I'm
 

59
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,310
shoulder let's say I'm I'm here and I'm
going to gather a center you see which

60
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,320
going to gather a center you see which
 

61
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,350
going to gather a center you see which
way is it moving on that way don't

62
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,360
way is it moving on that way don't
 

63
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,149
way is it moving on that way don't
gather your Center which way is the

64
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
gather your Center which way is the
 

65
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,749
gather your Center which way is the
shoulder moving that way you see so even

66
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
shoulder moving that way you see so even
 

67
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,749
shoulder moving that way you see so even
if I had the even if I had the internal

68
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:56,759
if I had the even if I had the internal
 

69
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,429
if I had the even if I had the internal
skills you're going to move him that way

70
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:00,439
skills you're going to move him that way
 

71
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,870
skills you're going to move him that way
but we know he needs to

72
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
but we know he needs to
 

73
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,150
but we know he needs to
go this way you guys see that

74
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,160
go this way you guys see that
 

75
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,910
go this way you guys see that
okay

76
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
okay
 

77
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,110
okay
so we already know no matter if I do

78
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
so we already know no matter if I do
 

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,630
so we already know no matter if I do
this with his shoulder on his side of

80
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:19,640
this with his shoulder on his side of
 

81
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,070
this with his shoulder on his side of
the sagittal plane you're not going to

82
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
the sagittal plane you're not going to
 

83
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,670
the sagittal plane you're not going to
end up here okay now let's bring

84
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
end up here okay now let's bring
 

85
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,990
end up here okay now let's bring
him way fast

86
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,000
him way fast
 

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,030
him way fast
you see it okay so we'll mark his

88
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,040
you see it okay so we'll mark his
 

89
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,190
you see it okay so we'll mark his
shoulder he'll be his shoulder you're my

90
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,200
shoulder he'll be his shoulder you're my
 

91
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,790
shoulder he'll be his shoulder you're my
shoulder got it and he's way past do you

92
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
shoulder got it and he's way past do you
 

93
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,550
shoulder got it and he's way past do you
understand and I do the same thing and

94
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,560
understand and I do the same thing and
 

95
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,390
understand and I do the same thing and
you can see the shoulder is doing the

96
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
you can see the shoulder is doing the
 

97
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,869
you can see the shoulder is doing the
same thing it's going up to his shoulder

98
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
same thing it's going up to his shoulder
 

99
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,990
same thing it's going up to his shoulder
you see and even if I if I internally

100
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
you see and even if I if I internally
 

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,949
you see and even if I if I internally
capture in Center he moves that way you

102
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
capture in Center he moves that way you
 

103
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,670
capture in Center he moves that way you
see he's not going around me okay

104
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:00,680
see he's not going around me okay
 

105
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,670
see he's not going around me okay
okay so the takeaway here is you can't

106
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,680
okay so the takeaway here is you can't
 

107
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,149
okay so the takeaway here is you can't
do the spiral in any old place a time

108
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:09,159
do the spiral in any old place a time
 

109
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,869
do the spiral in any old place a time
just like in the last drill you can't

110
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:13,879
just like in the last drill you can't
 

111
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,270
just like in the last drill you can't
do the inward outward spiral any old

112
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
do the inward outward spiral any old
 

113
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,750
do the inward outward spiral any old
place in time you will end up with a

114
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
place in time you will end up with a
 

115
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,789
place in time you will end up with a
different anatomical positioning and the

116
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:22,799
different anatomical positioning and the
 

117
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,990
different anatomical positioning and the
throw isn't going to necessarily be

118
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
throw isn't going to necessarily be
 

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,350
throw isn't going to necessarily be
there what usually happens is your in is

120
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,360
there what usually happens is your in is
 

121
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,350
there what usually happens is your in is
always just go

122
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,360
always just go
 

123
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,190
always just go
do you understand it's not the same

124
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
do you understand it's not the same
 

125
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,030
do you understand it's not the same
thing

126
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
thing
 

127
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,390
thing
as he's going to

128
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400

 

129
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,270

go he's going to go you see that he

130
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,280
go he's going to go you see that he
 

131
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,910
go he's going to go you see that he
didn't roll he got thrown over here and

132
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
didn't roll he got thrown over here and
 

133
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,229
didn't roll he got thrown over here and
then took

134
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:53,239
then took
 

135
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,229
then took
a biomechanic so he doesn't land on his

136
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,239
a biomechanic so he doesn't land on his
 

137
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,589
a biomechanic so he doesn't land on his
back that's me throwing him

138
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
back that's me throwing him
 

139
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,509
back that's me throwing him
okay so

140
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:04,519

 

141
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,030

likewise an

142
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
likewise an
 

143
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,710
likewise an
eel where this

144
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
eel where this
 

145
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,270
eel where this
works

146
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,280
works
 

147
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,390
works
is

148
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
is
 

149
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,069
is
here so if we're when I start to push

150
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,079
here so if we're when I start to push
 

151
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,830
here so if we're when I start to push
into his

152
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
into his
 

153
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,189
into his
Center his shoulder is going to

154
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
Center his shoulder is going to
 

155
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,990
Center his shoulder is going to
be in the same plane as mine you see

156
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,000
be in the same plane as mine you see
 

157
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,710
be in the same plane as mine you see
that and depending on the time you get

158
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:33,720
that and depending on the time you get
 

159
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,270
that and depending on the time you get
some timing variables it can be

160
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,280
some timing variables it can be
 

161
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,990
some timing variables it can be
here and or here so it could be right on

162
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,000
here and or here so it could be right on
 

163
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,629
here and or here so it could be right on
the line you understand okay right

164
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
the line you understand okay right
 

165
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,790
the line you understand okay right
before the

166
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:47,800
before the
 

167
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,550
before the
line right after the line because I'll

168
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,560
line right after the line because I'll
 

169
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,670
line right after the line because I'll
always be able to make micro adjustments

170
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
always be able to make micro adjustments
 

171
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,350
always be able to make micro adjustments
on where I enter and then how fast my

172
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,360
on where I enter and then how fast my
 

173
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,629
on where I enter and then how fast my
arm is going through the spiral you you

174
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
arm is going through the spiral you you
 

175
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,510
arm is going through the spiral you you
have some leeway in there okay

176
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
have some leeway in there okay
 

177
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,830
have some leeway in there okay
so I'm going to always bring him his

178
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
so I'm going to always bring him his
 

179
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,629
so I'm going to always bring him his
shoulder to the same plan I'll do it

180
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
shoulder to the same plan I'll do it
 

181
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,270
shoulder to the same plan I'll do it
again so let's mark

182
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280

 

183
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,590

it and it's just right before this one I

184
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
it and it's just right before this one I
 

185
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,430
it and it's just right before this one I
don't know how far is

186
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
don't know how far is
 

187
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:51,350
don't know how far is
that uh probably 2 in okay that'll work

188
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360

 

189
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,230

I'm sure within there sometimes it was

190
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm sure within there sometimes it was
 

191
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,990
I'm sure within there sometimes it was
here sometimes it was here sometimes it

192
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
here sometimes it was here sometimes it
 

193
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,670
here sometimes it was here sometimes it
was here okay so let's just play with

194
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,680
was here okay so let's just play with
 

195
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:21,150
was here okay so let's just play with
eel

196
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,160

 

197
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,909

test we can still work on the forearm of

198
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
test we can still work on the forearm of
 

199
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,950
test we can still work on the forearm of
the inward spiral cuz it's the same it's

200
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
the inward spiral cuz it's the same it's
 

201
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:40,710
the inward spiral cuz it's the same it's
where the shoulder is different now

202
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720

 

203
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,629

it's a little too far still that

204
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639

 

205
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,870

way still too

206
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880

 

207
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,469

far you got to bring it in

208
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:53,479
far you got to bring it in
 

209
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,029
far you got to bring it in
more got to bring him in

210
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
more got to bring him in
 

211
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,309
more got to bring him in
more and you so uh let's go back a

212
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
more and you so uh let's go back a
 

213
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,909
more and you so uh let's go back a
little

214
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
little
 

215
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,990
little
bit it's it's uh about meaning and

216
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
bit it's it's uh about meaning and
 

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,430
bit it's it's uh about meaning and
matching variables so how much spinal

218
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,440
matching variables so how much spinal
 

219
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,510
matching variables so how much spinal
displacement he has is going to

220
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
displacement he has is going to
 

221
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,950
displacement he has is going to
determine whether

222
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:15,960
determine whether
 

223
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,309
determine whether
I how far I go forward or how far I go

224
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
I how far I go forward or how far I go
 

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,950
I how far I go forward or how far I go
back do you get that so in other words

226
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:23,960
back do you get that so in other words
 

227
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,589
back do you get that so in other words
if it give me a lot of spinal

228
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
if it give me a lot of spinal
 

229
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,510
if it give me a lot of spinal
displacement if I move forward then that

230
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520
displacement if I move forward then that
 

231
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,029
displacement if I move forward then that
thing pass me and you have to now do a

232
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
thing pass me and you have to now do a
 

233
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,629
thing pass me and you have to now do a
different technique

234
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
different technique
 

235
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,990
different technique
okay you have to be able to feel that

236
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,000
okay you have to be able to feel that
 

237
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,029
okay you have to be able to feel that
what am I feeling for I'm feeling for

238
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
what am I feeling for I'm feeling for
 

239
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,230
what am I feeling for I'm feeling for
neutral y okay so uh same thing if he

240
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
neutral y okay so uh same thing if he
 

241
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,869
neutral y okay so uh same thing if he
has little spinal displacement and I

242
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
has little spinal displacement and I
 

243
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,110
has little spinal displacement and I
want my foot to go to four he's going to

244
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
want my foot to go to four he's going to
 

245
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,990
want my foot to go to four he's going to
be on that side and I'm going to pull

246
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
be on that side and I'm going to pull
 

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,149
be on that side and I'm going to pull
him so you have to feel what he's doing

248
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:53,159
him so you have to feel what he's doing
 

249
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,990
him so you have to feel what he's doing
you can

250
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,000
you can
 

251
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,029
you can
control you see when you're internal

252
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:58,039
control you see when you're internal
 

253
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,469
control you see when you're internal
boom and you'll get it

254
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
boom and you'll get it
 

255
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,189
boom and you'll get it
okay but you don't you don't do the

256
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
okay but you don't you don't do the
 

257
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,990
okay but you don't you don't do the
beginner mistake of going um that was

258
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,000
beginner mistake of going um that was
 

259
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,550
beginner mistake of going um that was
too

260
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
too
 

261
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,550
too
far and you keep trying to M just it's a

262
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,560
far and you keep trying to M just it's a
 

263
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,589
far and you keep trying to M just it's a
feeling you feel what it

264
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:14,599
feeling you feel what it
 

265
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:23,350
feeling you feel what it
is

266
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360

 

267
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,670

and when you have the internal skills

268
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
and when you have the internal skills
 

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,309
and when you have the internal skills
you can go forward you can make it

270
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:27,319
you can go forward you can make it
 

271
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,629
you can go forward you can make it
smaller you understand but what is where

272
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:29,639
smaller you understand but what is where
 

273
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,749
smaller you understand but what is where
are you trying to get to that shoulder

274
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
are you trying to get to that shoulder
 

275
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,469
are you trying to get to that shoulder
is where my shoulder is more or less I

276
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
is where my shoulder is more or less I
 

277
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,230
is where my shoulder is more or less I
get 2 in for

278
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240
get 2 in for
 

279
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,230
get 2 in for
Virginia of mar for air okay let try it

280
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,240
Virginia of mar for air okay let try it
 

281
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,550
Virginia of mar for air okay let try it
again study it now with these

282
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:45,560
again study it now with these
 

283
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,389
again study it now with these
planes don't just do what felt right cuz

284
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
planes don't just do what felt right cuz
 

285
00:08:48,399 --> 00:09:20,230
planes don't just do what felt right cuz
probably what felt right is wrong

286
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240

 

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:30,470

he's getting too far past you

288

Hole okay but if the bullet is touching
the line of the other Circle I'll

312
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
the line of the other Circle I'll
 

313
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,750
the line of the other Circle I'll
 take it okay but I'm always

314

always trying to get shoulder to
 

319
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,069
always trying to get shoulder to
shoulder knowing hey bullet holes

320
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079
shoulder knowing hey bullet holes
 

321
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,470
shoulder knowing hey bullet holes
touching that dude's toes got it so 4 in

322
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480
touching that dude's toes got it so 4 in
 

323
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,670
touching that dude's toes got it so 4 in
it's still going to work but I don't

324
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
it's still going to work but I don't
 

325
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:05,870
it's still going to work but I don't
take advantage of that okay try it again

326
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:05,880

 

327
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,750

he's

328
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:06,760
he's
 

329
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,389
he's
ahead he's I'm sorry he's Behind

330

resistance and you take it on the circle
 

819
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,789
resistance and you take it on the circle
so so his resistance needs to go

820
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
so so his resistance needs to go
 

821

I'll try another means I'll explain it

912
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:26,679
I'll try another means I'll explain it
 

913
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,549
I'll try another means I'll explain it
to them and here's how you explain it to

914
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:29,559
to them and here's how you explain it to
 

915
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,789
to them and here's how you explain it to
them UK you're not supposed to increase

916
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
them UK you're not supposed to increase
 

917
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,750
them UK you're not supposed to increase
the energetic values at the contact

918

the energetic values at the contact
 

919
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,029
the energetic values at the contact
points so when the UK tries to go out of

00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,039
points so when the UK tries to go out of
 

921
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:43,269
points so when the UK tries to go out of
it they're increasing the Y value at the

922
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
it they're increasing the Y value at the
 

923
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,269
it they're increasing the Y value at the
elbow Point you're not supposed to do

that that's not what you do to train in
 

927
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,470
that that's not what you do to train in
the art via the ukmi vector so no that's

928
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:53,480
the art via the ukmi vector so no that's
 

929
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,389
the art via the ukmi vector so no that's
not allowed the other thing I do is the

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,160
here and take the top mount and maybe
 

1039

work some
 

1041
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,950
work some
choke and we'll just do that all

1042
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:51,960
choke and we'll just do that all
 

1043
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,109
choke and we'll just do that all
night okay and somewhere in there I'll

1044
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
night okay and somewhere in there I'll
 

1045
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,150
night okay and somewhere in there I'll
explain to them like don't give one over

1046
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
explain to them like don't give one over
 

1047

opening that's worse than the other
 

1049
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,270
opening that's worse than the other
opening okay if you look at the

1050
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280
opening okay if you look at the
 

1051
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,309
opening okay if you look at the
technique the inherent logic in the

1052
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:05,319
technique the inherent logic in the
 

1053
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,750
technique the inherent logic in the
technique is that the arm is

1054
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
technique is that the arm is
 

1055
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,950
technique is that the arm is
isolatable that's why I'm using it the

1056
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
isolatable that's why I'm using it the
 

1057
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,589
isolatable that's why I'm using it the
arm is only isolatable because the

1058
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
arm is only isolatable because the
 

1059
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,069
arm is only isolatable because the
center is not

1060
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
center is not
 

1061
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,190
center is not
accessible hence when he made his Center

1062
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,200
accessible hence when he made his Center
 

1063
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,470
accessible hence when he made his Center
available for top mount neon belly his

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:25,480
available for top mount neon belly his
 

1065

available for top mount neon belly his
arm is not isolatable I should not be

can't do it because the freaking arm is

the arm is

the arm is
isolatable and open to eel so that's the
