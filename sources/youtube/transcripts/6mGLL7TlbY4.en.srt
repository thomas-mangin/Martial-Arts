it's almost like I had to go
this is just this is just my this is

120
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:02,340
this is just this is just my this is
 

121
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,449
this is just this is just my this is
just my hand you know but if I go with

122
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:05,459
just my hand you know but if I go with
 

123
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,270
just my hand you know but if I go with
my mind

124
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,280

 

125
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,149

it's almost like you're pushing air

126
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,159
it's almost like you're pushing air
 

127
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,070
it's almost like you're pushing air
that's the only way I could describe it

128
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
that's the only way I could describe it
 

129
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,369
that's the only way I could describe it
to you it's like I'm pushing air and if

130
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:16,379
to you it's like I'm pushing air and if
 

131
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,110
to you it's like I'm pushing air and if
you do this with your hands you can

132
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
you do this with your hands you can
 

133
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,490
you do this with your hands you can
actually feel what I mean about

134
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:19,500
actually feel what I mean about
 

135
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,949
actually feel what I mean about
condensing air

136
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:21,959
condensing air
 

137
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,130
condensing air
so you know you can try it by all means

138
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,140
so you know you can try it by all means
 

139
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,350
so you know you can try it by all means
you know I don't always talk about this

140
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
you know I don't always talk about this
 

141
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,750
you know I don't always talk about this
stuff sometimes I do but if you can feel

142
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
stuff sometimes I do but if you can feel
 

143
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,910
stuff sometimes I do but if you can feel
this condensing of air between your two

144
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
this condensing of air between your two
 

145
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,350
this condensing of air between your two
hands

146
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
hands
 

147
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,330
hands
is it condensed in air or is it

148
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,340
is it condensed in air or is it
 

149
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,030
is it condensed in air or is it
condensing your energy

150
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
condensing your energy
 

151
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,390
condensing your energy
so when I do this it's a measured point

152
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
so when I do this it's a measured point
 

153
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,710
so when I do this it's a measured point
over him and it's a measured point I

154
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,720
over him and it's a measured point I
 

155
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,850
over him and it's a measured point I
mustn't go further or else it will

156
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:49,860
mustn't go further or else it will
 

157
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,710
mustn't go further or else it will
the space will be too great

158
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720

 

159
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,830

too complicated really isn't it

160
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
too complicated really isn't it
 

161
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,149
too complicated really isn't it
but uh

162
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159

 

163
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,910

that's when you see oh you see how are

164
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
that's when you see oh you see how are
 

165
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,530
that's when you see oh you see how are
you going to learn that you've got to

166
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:06,540
you going to learn that you've got to
 

167
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,570
you going to learn that you've got to
watch how Scentsy and you've got to try

168
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,580
watch how Scentsy and you've got to try
