91
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,510

this is me moving my head legs and

92
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
this is me moving my head legs and
 

93

95
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,469
hands i don't want that i don't want
consciousness in them

96
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
consciousness in them
 

97
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,749
consciousness in them
i want my

98
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
i want my
 

99
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:25,990
i want my
effort my intention in here

100
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000

 

101
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,470

okay let's try it

102
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480

 

103
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,630

so you're consciously moving your head

104
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
so you're consciously moving your head
 

105
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,309
so you're consciously moving your head
your head is relaxed

106
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

107
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,309

but you see it's stuck

108
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
but you see it's stuck
 

109
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:52,390
but you see it's stuck
do you see that

110
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400

 

111
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,670

that's your legs

112
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680

 

113
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,309

so your feet are right now not connected

114
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
so your feet are right now not connected
 

115
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:24,630
so your feet are right now not connected
to your center

116
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

117
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,110

that that's a conscious movement of your

118
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
that that's a conscious movement of your
 

119
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,670
that that's a conscious movement of your
upper shoulders and neck area which is

120
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
upper shoulders and neck area which is
 

121
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,830
upper shoulders and neck area which is
why it moved

122
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
why it moved
 

123
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:49,910
why it moved
don't you don't move your extremities

124
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920

 

125
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,190

now

126
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
now
 

127
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,670
now
the next drill

128
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
the next drill
 

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,470
the next drill
is

130
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
is
 

131
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,509
is
taking you more and more

132
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
taking you more and more
 

133
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,429
taking you more and more
into the religious overlay so

134
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
into the religious overlay so
 

135
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,910
into the religious overlay so
i do have to have this

136
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
i do have to have this
 

137
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
i do have to have this
relationship

138
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
relationship
 

139
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,350
relationship
so that i generate order

140
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360

 

141
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,750

here represented by the extremities to

142
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
here represented by the extremities to
 

143
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,309
here represented by the extremities to
my center

144
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
my center
 

145
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,069
my center
but ultimately there's going to be a

146
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
but ultimately there's going to be a
 

147
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,430
but ultimately there's going to be a
center

148
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440

 

149
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,469

to my relationship with okay

150
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
to my relationship with okay
 

151
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,469
to my relationship with okay
in other words there's going to be order

152
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479

 

153
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,189

and there's going to be order to how i

154
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
and there's going to be order to how i
 

155
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,590
and there's going to be order to how i
fall

156
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600

 

157
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,749

and all of those things are

158
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
and all of those things are
 

159
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,629
and all of those things are
cultivation arenas by which

160
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
cultivation arenas by which
 

161
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,710
cultivation arenas by which
i either succumb to

162
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
i either succumb to
 

163
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,350
i either succumb to
the fear or i stay

164
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
the fear or i stay
 

165
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,110
the fear or i stay
in the iq okay so we're going to start

166
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
in the iq okay so we're going to start
 

167
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,510
in the iq okay so we're going to start
generating um

168
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
generating um
 

169
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,870
generating um
the spiraling

170
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880

 

171
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,870

aspect

172
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
aspect
 

173
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,749
aspect
to this center periphery

174
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
to this center periphery
 

175
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,150
to this center periphery
organization

176
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160

 

177
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,189

so i'm going to open my feet up

178
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
so i'm going to open my feet up
 

179

and i still right now i establish i'm
 

181
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,950
and i still right now i establish i'm
going to establish the order okay and

182
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
going to establish the order okay and
 

183
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,230
going to establish the order okay and
i'll first do

184
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
i'll first do
 

185
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,430

okay we're going to go around in the
 

229
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,870
okay we're going to go around in the
circle

230
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
circle
 

231
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,510
circle
and this is also going to give the new

232
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
and this is also going to give the new
 

233
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,670
and this is also going to give the new
student

234
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
student
 

235
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,469
student
the

236
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
the
 

237
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,870
the
hand foot coordination

238
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
hand foot coordination
 

239
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,510
hand foot coordination
of the later break falls okay

240
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
of the later break falls okay
 

241
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,270
of the later break falls okay
so as my head goes down

242
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
so as my head goes down
 

243
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,270
so as my head goes down
and to my right the left leg is going to

244
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
and to my right the left leg is going to
 

245
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,510
and to my right the left leg is going to
stay in that relationship

246
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
stay in that relationship
 

247
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,510
stay in that relationship
so left head leg head and right hand

248
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
so left head leg head and right hand
 

249
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,309
so left head leg head and right hand
okay

250
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
okay
 

251
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,870
okay
so disorganized would be like this

252
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880

 

253
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,110

organizes it goes together

254
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120

 

255
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,670

and i'm using this to get up and to go

256
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
and i'm using this to get up and to go
 

257
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,390
and i'm using this to get up and to go
down to get up and to go down

258
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
down to get up and to go down
 

259
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:00,830
down to get up and to go down
so we'll do one way i'm going around

260
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

261
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,510

boom the pattern is hand hand foot foot

262
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
boom the pattern is hand hand foot foot
 

263
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,150
boom the pattern is hand hand foot foot
hand hand foot foot

264
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
hand hand foot foot
 

265
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,909
hand hand foot foot
you go and then you want to go the other

266
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
you go and then you want to go the other
 

267
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:21,110
you go and then you want to go the other
way hand hand foot foot

268
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120

 

269
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,629

your head stays in that relationship

270
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
your head stays in that relationship
 

271
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,430
your head stays in that relationship
with your feet in this relationship

272
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
with your feet in this relationship
 

273
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,510
with your feet in this relationship
so you see where my head is

274
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
so you see where my head is
 

275
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,469
so you see where my head is
stays there

276
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479

 

277
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,710

keep your feet apart

278
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
keep your feet apart
 

279
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,390
keep your feet apart
don't let them come in

280
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
don't let them come in
 

281
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,869
don't let them come in
okay let's try that

282
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879

 

283
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,830

so right there you you felt that little

284
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
so right there you you felt that little
 

285
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,390
so right there you you felt that little
right there do you feel that yes okay so

286
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
right there do you feel that yes okay so
 

287
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,950
right there do you feel that yes okay so
that looks like strength to me

288
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
that looks like strength to me
 

289
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,189
that looks like strength to me
okay so we we have to condition to get

290
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
okay so we we have to condition to get
 

291
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,469
okay so we we have to condition to get
rid of that

292
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
rid of that
 

293
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,309
rid of that
there's no point in asking you

294
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
there's no point in asking you
 

295
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,710
there's no point in asking you
spiritually to remain ordered if

296
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
spiritually to remain ordered if
 

297
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,510
spiritually to remain ordered if
physically you cannot okay

298
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
physically you cannot okay
 

299

physically you cannot okay
but there's not really that much

300
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
but there's not really that much
 

301
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,749
but there's not really that much
strength in this drill

302
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
strength in this drill
 

303
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,390

cesar is already
 

399
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,470
cesar is already
that organization

400
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
that organization
 

401
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,590
that organization
in play

402
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
in play
 

403
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,630
in play
you're already learning and doing and

404
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
you're already learning and doing and
 

405
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,990
you're already learning and doing and
practicing

406
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
practicing
 

407
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,949
practicing
the very body organization that you're

408
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
the very body organization that you're
 

409
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,350
the very body organization that you're
using in your nagewasa and of course in

410
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
using in your nagewasa and of course in
 

411
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,790
using in your nagewasa and of course in
your campaign

412
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
your campaign
 

413
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,509
your campaign
so you're already in that relationship

414
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
so you're already in that relationship
 

415
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,190
so you're already in that relationship
so we're going to now extend that

416
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
so we're going to now extend that
 

417
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,829
so we're going to now extend that
relationship and take one component of

418
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
relationship and take one component of
 

419
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,350
relationship and take one component of
the last drill and i'm going to relate

420
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
the last drill and i'm going to relate
 

421
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,069
the last drill and i'm going to relate
and generate that order by relating my

422
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
and generate that order by relating my
 

423
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,030
and generate that order by relating my
head to my foot so i'm going to take my

424
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
head to my foot so i'm going to take my
 

425
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,150
head to my foot so i'm going to take my
head left foot right hand okay

426
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
head left foot right hand okay
 

427
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,030
head left foot right hand okay
and do one portion and start to learn

428
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
and do one portion and start to learn
 

429
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,430
and do one portion and start to learn
this back break fall okay but it's key

430
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
this back break fall okay but it's key
 

431
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,509
this back break fall okay but it's key
that i'm not disconnecting not over

432
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
that i'm not disconnecting not over
 

433
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,949
that i'm not disconnecting not over
tension

434
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
tension
 

435
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,949
tension
everything is just my body

436
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
everything is just my body
 

437
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,670
everything is just my body
and i'm going to experience

438
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
and i'm going to experience
 

439
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,470
and i'm going to experience
a slight feeling of falling and this is

440
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
a slight feeling of falling and this is
 

441
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,269
a slight feeling of falling and this is
where that fear comes in and the

442
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:04,279
where that fear comes in and the
 

443
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,030
where that fear comes in and the
disorganization comes in okay but you

444
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
disorganization comes in okay but you
 

445
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,829
disorganization comes in okay but you
were already falling in the last row so

446
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
were already falling in the last row so
 

447
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,230
were already falling in the last row so
use your imagination to make this drill

448
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
use your imagination to make this drill
 

449
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,910
use your imagination to make this drill
like the last row

450
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
like the last row
 

451
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,829
like the last row
we're going to do back breakfall

452
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
we're going to do back breakfall
 

453
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,230
we're going to do back breakfall
uh mechanics starting with the right

454
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
uh mechanics starting with the right
 

455
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,750
uh mechanics starting with the right
side okay so as my body comes out my

456
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
side okay so as my body comes out my
 

457
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,030
side okay so as my body comes out my
head is moving my leg will come out

458
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
head is moving my leg will come out
 

459
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,470
head is moving my leg will come out
and this would be if i continue the last

460
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
and this would be if i continue the last
 

461
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,389
and this would be if i continue the last
drill

462
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399

 

463
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,629

incorrect would be this

464
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
incorrect would be this
 

465
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,350
incorrect would be this
you can see i'm segmented

466
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360

 

467
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,590

so from cesa

468
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
so from cesa
 

469
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,430
so from cesa

491
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,990

from there you can

492
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
from there you can
 

493
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,310
from there you can
uh introduce the timing aspects of

494
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
uh introduce the timing aspects of
 

495
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,150
uh introduce the timing aspects of
hitting the mat so i'll do the same

496
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
hitting the mat so i'll do the same
 

497
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,150
hitting the mat so i'll do the same
thing out

498

okay let's try that one most of us
 

585
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,189
okay let's try that one most of us
okay next drill you take one leg up one

586
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
okay next drill you take one leg up one
 

587
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,189
okay next drill you take one leg up one
leg up and it's the same drop

588
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199

 

589
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,350

one leg up

591
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,990

and this leg is lowering the head

592
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
and this leg is lowering the head
 

593
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,310
and this leg is lowering the head
so i'm not falling and picking the leg

594
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
so i'm not falling and picking the leg
 

595
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,069
so i'm not falling and picking the leg
up there's doing both

up there's doing both
 

597
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,829
up there's doing both
yes the legs coming up because the

598
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
yes the legs coming up because the
 

599
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,749
yes the legs coming up because the
head's going down but the leg is helping

600
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
head's going down but the leg is helping
 

601
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,749

605
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,629

okay let's try it mostly

606
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
okay let's try it mostly
 

607
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,949
okay let's try it mostly
okay uh this one both knees are up

608

okay uh this one both knees are up
 

609
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,509
okay uh this one both knees are up
i have that same box center

610
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
i have that same box center
 

611
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:15,610
i have that same box center
goes down the same way

same cesa upper body posture

638
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160

 

639
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,389

still oriented this way

640
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
still oriented this way
 

641
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,829
still oriented this way
still in this l-shape to the line of

still in this l-shape to the line of
 

643
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,069
still in this l-shape to the line of
attack okay let's try both sides

644
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
attack okay let's try both sides
 

645
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,150
attack okay let's try both sides
okay so what you've done pedagogically

646
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
okay so what you've done pedagogically
 

647
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,309
okay so what you've done pedagogically
is you've taken the second drill

648
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
is you've taken the second drill
 

649
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,789
is you've taken the second drill
and you've just used it

650
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
and you've just used it
 

651
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,110
and you've just used it
to try to reconcile fear in the student

652
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
to try to reconcile fear in the student
 

653
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,350
to try to reconcile fear in the student
as they're going along okay

654
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
as they're going along okay
 

655
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,029
as they're going along okay
uh

656
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
uh
 

657
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,870
uh
now we're going to start standing but i

658
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
now we're going to start standing but i
 

659
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,230
now we're going to start standing but i
have my feet in keys of the last row

660
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
have my feet in keys of the last row
 

661
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,230
have my feet in keys of the last row
right now some people start freaking out

662
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
right now some people start freaking out
 

663
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,309
right now some people start freaking out
so you go no no it's like the last drill

664
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
so you go no no it's like the last drill
 

665
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,990
so you go no no it's like the last drill
you just go down

666
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
you just go down
 

667
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,350
you just go down
and do it

668
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360

 

669
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,950

boom open your knees drop center lock

670
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960

 

671
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,870

usually at this point you'll see the

672
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
usually at this point you'll see the
 

673
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,710
usually at this point you'll see the
beginner mistake but you'll see that a

674
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
beginner mistake but you'll see that a
 

675
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,789
beginner mistake but you'll see that a
lot of schools will

676
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
lot of schools will
 

677
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,390
lot of schools will
make this

678
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
make this
 

679
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,549
make this
maybe intentionally even

680
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
maybe intentionally even
 

681
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,470
maybe intentionally even
because as they go down

682
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
because as they go down
 

683
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,350
because as they go down
this leg's going to roll in

684
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
this leg's going to roll in
 

685
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,350
this leg's going to roll in
and this is now going to keep their head

686
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
and this is now going to keep their head
 

687
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,830
and this is now going to keep their head
on the line of attack

688
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840

 

689
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,549

that doesn't work run

690
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559

 

691
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,830

because the back right ball kazushi

692
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
because the back right ball kazushi
 

693
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,470
because the back right ball kazushi
is on this spiral here

694
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
is on this spiral here
 

695
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,110
is on this spiral here
it's not on this one

696
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
it's not on this one
 

697
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,950
it's not on this one
oh i'm doing it

698
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
oh i'm doing it
 

699
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,870
oh i'm doing it
he's going this way

700
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880

 

701
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,789

and as i said

702
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
and as i said
 

703
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,230
and as i said
there's a lot a larger order there's the

704
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
there's a lot a larger order there's the
 

705
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,230
there's a lot a larger order there's the

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
order between his body periphery center
 

707
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,870
order between his body periphery center
then the order between he and i and the

708
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
then the order between he and i and the
 

709
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,350
then the order between he and i and the
order between he and i the attack and

710
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
order between he and i the attack and
 

711
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,470
order between he and i the attack and
the throne okay so you can't just fall

712
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
the throne okay so you can't just fall
 

713
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,350
the throne okay so you can't just fall
in the old way you have to

714
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
in the old way you have to
 

715
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,390
in the old way you have to
maintain this organization alright so as

716
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
maintain this organization alright so as

i'm doing this drill

718
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
i'm doing this drill
 

719
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,590
i'm doing this drill
i open and i do the last drill the knee

720
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
i open and i do the last drill the knee
 

721
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:02,390
i open and i do the last drill the knee
goes this way

722
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400

 

723
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,470

okay let's try both sides

724
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
okay let's try both sides
 

725
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,350
okay let's try both sides
so pedagogically i'm only uh i'm only

726
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
so pedagogically i'm only uh i'm only
 

727
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,070
so pedagogically i'm only uh i'm only
inserting the illusion of height because

728
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
inserting the illusion of height because
 

729
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,990
inserting the illusion of height because
it drops down to the same other level

730
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
it drops down to the same other level
 

731
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,390
it drops down to the same other level
but it is enough to start generating

732
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
but it is enough to start generating
 

733
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,710
but it is enough to start generating
fear in the intestine now i'm going to

734
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
fear in the intestine now i'm going to
 

735
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,909
fear in the intestine now i'm going to
enter

736
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
enter
 

737
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,070
enter
introduce the illusion of momentum okay

738
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
introduce the illusion of momentum okay
 

739
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,230
introduce the illusion of momentum okay
so i'm going to have them start with the

740
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
so i'm going to have them start with the
 

741
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,390
so i'm going to have them start with the
right foot forward

742
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
right foot forward
 

743
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,830
right foot forward
take one step back into the last row go

744
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
take one step back into the last row go
 

745
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,870
take one step back into the last row go
down

746
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880

 

747
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,510

and do the same last row

748
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
and do the same last row
 

749
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,470
and do the same last row
so it's one step

750
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480

 

751
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,669

one step

752
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
one step
 

753
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,630
one step
down

754
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640

 

755
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,510

again don't let the momentum expose your

756
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
again don't let the momentum expose your
 

757
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,390
again don't let the momentum expose your
block

758
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
block
 

759
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,590
block
that's a no-no you're losing connection

760
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
that's a no-no you're losing connection
 

761
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,950
that's a no-no you're losing connection
with the noggin

762
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
with the noggin
 

763
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,310
with the noggin
okay

764
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
okay
 

765
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,070
okay
try it both sides

766
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
try it both sides
 

767
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,990
try it both sides
okay now you're going to increase

768
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
okay now you're going to increase
 

769
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,710
okay now you're going to increase
the age the illusion of momentum and

770
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
the age the illusion of momentum and
 

771
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,470
the age the illusion of momentum and
you're going to reintroduce agency okay

772
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
you're going to reintroduce agency okay
 

773
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,870
you're going to reintroduce agency okay
so they have to take the dashi has to

774
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
so they have to take the dashi has to
 

775
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,149
so they have to take the dashi has to
take at least

776
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
take at least
 

777
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,669
take at least
three steps

778
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
three steps
 

779
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,590
three steps
and then they can decide

780
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
and then they can decide
 

781
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,430
and then they can decide
where they're going to go

782
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
where they're going to go
 

783
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,950
where they're going to go
down which foot

784
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
down which foot
 

785
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,470
down which foot
okay

786
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
okay
 

787
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,270
okay
when they walk they walk straight back

788
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280

 

789
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,590

not in an artificial way

790
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600

 

791
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,190

just straight back

just straight back
 

793
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,909
just straight back
and when they decide to take the fall

794
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
and when they decide to take the fall
 

795
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,070
and when they decide to take the fall
that's when that foot goes into the last

796
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
that's when that foot goes into the last
 

797
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,350
that's when that foot goes into the last
drill

798
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
drill
 

799
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,710
drill
okay

800

walking
 

807
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,470
walking
down foot out

when they feel comfortable you can have
them pick it up

812

the comfort is not a chemi
the control is not a chemi

826
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
the control is not a chemi
 

827
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,230
the control is not a chemi
nor the fear that it's operating through

828
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
nor the fear that it's operating through
 

829
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,909

uh what he's gonna do now
 

835
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,029
uh what he's gonna do now
is push me

836
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
is push me
 

837
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,150
is push me
with some energy

838
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,160
with some energy
 

839
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,190

okay so he's gonna push me i'm gonna

844
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
okay so he's gonna push me i'm gonna
 

845
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,510
okay so he's gonna push me i'm gonna
absorb that energy

846
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
absorb that energy
 

847
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,470
absorb that energy
in the number of steps

848
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
in the number of steps
 

849
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,190
in the number of steps
that i end up taking

850
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
that i end up taking
 

851
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,830
that i end up taking
and i when i go to the fall

852
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
and i when i go to the fall
 

853
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,230
and i when i go to the fall
i turn the foot out and i do that other

854
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
i turn the foot out and i do that other
 

855
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,750
i turn the foot out and i do that other
drill so he's pushing

856
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760

 

857
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,990

don't let the extra momentum

858
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
don't let the extra momentum
 

859
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,510
don't let the extra momentum
turn you around

860
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520

 

861
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,789

at this point

862
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
at this point
 

863
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,110
at this point
we can teach how to get up

864
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
we can teach how to get up
 

865
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,750
we can teach how to get up
we use a triangle get up

866
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
we use a triangle get up
 

867
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,549
we use a triangle get up
so

868
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
so
 

869
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,029
so
a little slower he's pushing

870
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
a little slower he's pushing
 

871
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,630
a little slower he's pushing
i'm going down

872
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640

 

873
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,630

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,270
step out
up

882
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280

 

883
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,029

the end slope

884
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
the end slope
 

885
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,870
the end slope
don't use the energy

886
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
don't use the energy
 

887
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,350
don't use the energy
okay give you a block and come around

888
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
okay give you a block and come around
 

889
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,110
okay give you a block and come around
that's a no-no

890
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120

 

891
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,630

push

892
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640

 

893
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,549

okay let's try comparison

894
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559

 

895
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,149

okay since i lose my agency to a degree

896
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
okay since i lose my agency to a degree
 

897
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,310
okay since i lose my agency to a degree
and the guy has control this is really

898
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
and the guy has control this is really
 

899
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,430
and the guy has control this is really
where you start to see the

900
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
where you start to see the
 

901
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,990
where you start to see the
disorganization come in because the fear

902
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
disorganization come in because the fear
 

903
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,390
disorganization come in because the fear
sets in the darkness sets in and it it's

904
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
sets in the darkness sets in and it it's
 

905
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,950
sets in the darkness sets in and it it's
chaos it disorganizes things so i

906
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
chaos it disorganizes things so i
 

907
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,270
chaos it disorganizes things so i
started to have my center

908
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
started to have my center
 

909
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,990
started to have my center
moving with all my extremities moving

910
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
moving with all my extremities moving
 

911
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,630
moving with all my extremities moving
okay

912
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640

 

913
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,430

so

914
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
so
 

915
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,270
so
uh the other thing that we've done up

916
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
uh the other thing that we've done up
 

917
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,789
uh the other thing that we've done up
till now is we used a static hold to

918
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
till now is we used a static hold to
 

919
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,750
till now is we used a static hold to
generate strength and coordination but

920
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
generate strength and coordination but
 

921
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,070
generate strength and coordination but
that's not really marginally functional

922
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
that's not really marginally functional
 

923
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,230
that's not really marginally functional
the first drill where you have a

924
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
the first drill where you have a
 

925
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,350
the first drill where you have a
percussive flexion that is what we're

926
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
percussive flexion that is what we're
 

927
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,549
percussive flexion that is what we're
after so we have to get back now to that

928
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
after so we have to get back now to that
 

929
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,029
after so we have to get back now to that
if you look that kind of happened here

930
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
if you look that kind of happened here
 

931
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,070
if you look that kind of happened here
because

932
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
because
 

933
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,549
because
people are like loose and then you have

934
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
people are like loose and then you have
 

935
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,470
people are like loose and then you have
to find your center so without them

936
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
to find your center so without them
 

937
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,310
to find your center so without them
knowing it

938
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
knowing it
 

939
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,909
knowing it
they're already getting a kind of

940
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
they're already getting a kind of
 

941
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,950
they're already getting a kind of
percussion but oftentimes their solution

942
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
percussion but oftentimes their solution
 

943
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,149
percussion but oftentimes their solution
is instead to do it with a disconnect

944
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
is instead to do it with a disconnect
 

945
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,430
is instead to do it with a disconnect
you see

946
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
you see
 

947
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,669
you see
instead of with

948
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
instead of with
 

949
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,549
instead of with
the

950
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
the
 

951
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,710
the
foot head coordination and that does not

952
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
foot head coordination and that does not
 

953
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,269
foot head coordination and that does not
work because when he disconnects his

954
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
work because when he disconnects his
 

955
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,350
work because when he disconnects his
head is coming forward and if i was

956
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
head is coming forward and if i was
 

957
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,909
head is coming forward and if i was
throwing him backwards his head is going

958
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
throwing him backwards his head is going
 

959
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,549
throwing him backwards his head is going
backwards so if he came forward i would

960
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
backwards so if he came forward i would
 

961
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,669
backwards so if he came forward i would
be adding force at impact to let's say a

962
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
be adding force at impact to let's say a
 

963
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,750
be adding force at impact to let's say a
palm heel strike or something okay so

964
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
palm heel strike or something okay so
 

965
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,470
palm heel strike or something okay so
his head has to keep going backwards my

966
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
his head has to keep going backwards my
 

967
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,990
his head has to keep going backwards my
head goes always this way

968
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000

 

969
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,789

i can't have my head go here

970
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
i can't have my head go here
 

971
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,750
i can't have my head go here
with that percussion with that flexion

972
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
with that percussion with that flexion
 

973
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,430
with that percussion with that flexion
my head is going

974
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
my head is going
 

975
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,430
my head is going
back up

976
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440

 

977
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,230

so on this drill

978
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
so on this drill
 

979
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,669
so on this drill
we're going to go

980
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
we're going to go
 

981
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,750
we're going to go
and hit that percussion

982
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
and hit that percussion
 

983
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,230
and hit that percussion
from the opposite extreme

984
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
from the opposite extreme
 

985
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,230
from the opposite extreme
because we don't want it we don't want

986
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
because we don't want it we don't want
 

987
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,230
because we don't want it we don't want
the head coming forward

988
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
the head coming forward
 

989
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,789
the head coming forward
so he's going to hold my

990
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
so he's going to hold my
 

991
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,870
so he's going to hold my
hakama

992
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
hakama
 

993
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,549
hakama
and get me to extend my center the other

994
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
and get me to extend my center the other
 

995
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,070
and get me to extend my center the other
way

996
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
way
 

997
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,830
way
the identity can decide what they're

998
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
the identity can decide what they're
 

999
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,750
the identity can decide what they're
comfortable with

1000
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760

 

1001
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,870

but the goal is to let it go let it go

1002
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
but the goal is to let it go let it go
 

1003
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,510
but the goal is to let it go let it go
as far as possible so come up off your

1004
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
as far as possible so come up off your
 

1005
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,029
as far as possible so come up off your
heels

1006
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
heels
 

1007
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,190
heels
you don't have your legs like this

1008
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
you don't have your legs like this
 

1009
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,630
you don't have your legs like this
you're just normal

1010
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
you're just normal
 

1011
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,909
you're just normal
he's holding me i don't have control he

1012
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
he's holding me i don't have control he
 

1013
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,110
he's holding me i don't have control he
decides

1014
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
decides
 

1015
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,510
decides
when he's going to let go

1016
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
when he's going to let go
 

1017
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,070
when he's going to let go
that's when i percuss the center like

1018
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
that's when i percuss the center like
 

1019
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,950
that's when i percuss the center like
the first drill okay so he's holding me

1020
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
the first drill okay so he's holding me
 

1021
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,669
the first drill okay so he's holding me
i give him my weight

1022
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679

 

1023
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,669

and i go into the fall

1024
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
and i go into the fall
 

1025
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,950
and i go into the fall
i get up

1026
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
i get up
 

1027
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,990
i get up
with the triangle get up

1028
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
with the triangle get up
 

1029
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,830
with the triangle get up
so here

1030
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
so here
 

1031
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,669
so here
i'm not

1032
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
i'm not
 

1033
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,710
i'm not
so vertical like in all the other drills

1034
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
so vertical like in all the other drills
 

1035
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,230
so vertical like in all the other drills
i have a bow

1036
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
i have a bow
 

1037
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,390
i have a bow
that i'm going to flex like the very

1038
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
that i'm going to flex like the very
 

1039
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,310
that i'm going to flex like the very
first drill we did

1040
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
first drill we did
 

1041
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:03,269
first drill we did
and i'll find my foot

1042
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279

 

1043
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,830

okay let's try

1044
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840

 

1045
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,669

it a little bit more flexion a little

1046
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
it a little bit more flexion a little
 

1047
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:19,029
it a little bit more flexion a little
earlier

1048
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039

 

1049
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,830

more

1050
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
more
 

1051
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,510
more
double it

1052
