00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,249

this okay

84
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:46,259
this okay
 

85
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,689
this okay
here

86
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:47,699
here
 

87
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,110
here
and I don't want to go here

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
and I don't want to go here
 

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,150
and I don't want to go here
then you think you're going to push him

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
then you think you're going to push him
 

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,469
then you think you're going to push him
again his face

92
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
again his face
 

93
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,350
again his face
right but every every okay all over the

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
right but every every okay all over the
 

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,990
right but every every okay all over the
world goes ahead and goes there but he's

96
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,000
world goes ahead and goes there but he's
 

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,350
world goes ahead and goes there but he's
in the he's in a good base his defensive

98
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,360
in the he's in a good base his defensive
 

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,290
in the he's in a good base his defensive
linemen doing this pretty much you see

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,300
linemen doing this pretty much you see
 

101
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,650
linemen doing this pretty much you see
okay so instead

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,660
okay so instead
 

103
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,670
okay so instead

do you see
 

135
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,370
do you see
so when you're here like this you reach

136
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
so when you're here like this you reach
 

137
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,689
so when you're here like this you reach
out

138
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:05,699

on the other side
 

143
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,010
on the other side
cutting down and then the idea you need

144
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,020
cutting down and then the idea you need
 

145
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,450
