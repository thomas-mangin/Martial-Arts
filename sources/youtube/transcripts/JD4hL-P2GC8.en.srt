this thing collapses and it doesn't go

330
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
this thing collapses and it doesn't go
 

331
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,310
this thing collapses and it doesn't go
into the ground it won't bounce back out

332
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,320
into the ground it won't bounce back out
 

333
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,030
into the ground it won't bounce back out
okay so I have to keep that structure as

334
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,040
okay so I have to keep that structure as
 

335
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,389
okay so I have to keep that structure as
I'm going and it's not that I'm yielding

336
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
I'm going and it's not that I'm yielding
 

337
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,710

right here is moving him in you see that

340
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,200
right here is moving him in you see that
 

341
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,110
right here is moving him in you see that
so I'm not trying to not use it I'm

342
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,120
so I'm not trying to not use it I'm
 

343
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,949
so I'm not trying to not use it I'm
using it on this part okay and then he's

344
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:53,959
using it on this part okay and then he's
 

345
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,230
using it on this part okay and then he's
using it and I'm using it I don't start

346
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
