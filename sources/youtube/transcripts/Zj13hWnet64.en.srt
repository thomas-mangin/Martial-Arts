267
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,550

you will perform this until you realize

271
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,270

you'll learn to be able to control the

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
you'll learn to be able to control the
 

273

281
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,170

and you'll release it efficiently

282
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,180
and you'll release it efficiently
 

283
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,689
and you'll release it efficiently
then we get to the next stage

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:16,860
I don't know if that's a fairy tale but
 

299
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,550
I don't know if that's a fairy tale but
it's a very big Village when I've been

it's a very big Village when I've been
 

301
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,249
it's a very big Village when I've been
there so I think that must have been a

there so I think that must have been a
 

303
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,890
there so I think that must have been a

304
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:24,900
very still night all the wind carrying
 

305
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,529
very still night all the wind carrying
is uh his key eye

306
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:27,539
is uh his key eye
 

307
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,589
is uh his key eye
but anyhow you can make a key eye very

308
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
but anyhow you can make a key eye very
 

309
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,890

okay so as with pour in The Jug through

316
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:43,860
okay so as with pour in The Jug through
 

317
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,089
okay so as with pour in The Jug through
a small receptacle I'm going to now say

318
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:47,099
a small receptacle I'm going to now say
 

319
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,550
a small receptacle I'm going to now say
that The Jug has

320
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,560
that The Jug has
 

321
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,150
that The Jug has
kale the Jack holds the key eye

322
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,160
kale the Jack holds the key eye
 

323
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,710
kale the Jack holds the key eye
so the power comes from the key eye

324
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
so the power comes from the key eye
 

325
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,290
so the power comes from the key eye
but you don't have Kia without control
