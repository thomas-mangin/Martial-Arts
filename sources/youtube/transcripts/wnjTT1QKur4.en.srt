1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,629

all right well it doesn't matter how we

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
all right well it doesn't matter how we
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,749
all right well it doesn't matter how we
get around to this K okay uh as I come

4
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:06,759
get around to this K okay uh as I come
 

5
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,509
get around to this K okay uh as I come
around here we want to reverse the we we

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
around here we want to reverse the we we
 

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,749
around here we want to reverse the we we
want to reverse engineer the M okay so

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
want to reverse engineer the M okay so
 

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,029
want to reverse engineer the M okay so
uh so I learn where the where the Joe is

10
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
uh so I learn where the where the Joe is
 

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,589
uh so I learn where the where the Joe is
okay so we know my attack is here on the

12
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:23,599
okay so we know my attack is here on the
 

13
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,349
okay so we know my attack is here on the
hands right there okay and we know that

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
hands right there okay and we know that
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,630
hands right there okay and we know that
that's going in his Center too okay

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:33,640

 

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,990

take those two elements and understand

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
take those two elements and understand
 

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,270
take those two elements and understand
that into a center has nothing to do

20
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
that into a center has nothing to do
 

21
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,310
that into a center has nothing to do
with how close I am to the center okay

22
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,320
with how close I am to the center okay
 

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,110
with how close I am to the center okay
so the my is really on the

24
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,120
so the my is really on the
 

25
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,670
so the my is really on the
hands don't reach don't get closer than

26
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,680
hands don't reach don't get closer than
 

27
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,830
hands don't reach don't get closer than
you are okay so this is about where

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,150
the top and you're going to lose it
okay so after you do the atos attack

330
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
okay so after you do the atos attack
 

331
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,790
okay so after you do the atos attack
this weapon or comes back up and

332
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
this weapon or comes back up and
 

333
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,269
this weapon or comes back up and
threatens okay and then you entering

334
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
threatens okay and then you entering
 

335
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,829
threatens okay and then you entering
behind the tip is what you're

336
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
behind the tip is what you're
 

337
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,590
behind the tip is what you're
doing don't leave it on the tuba boom

338
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
doing don't leave it on the tuba boom
 

339
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,430
doing don't leave it on the tuba boom
it's done its job check okay and then

340
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
it's done its job check okay and then
 

341
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,509
it's done its job check okay and then
come up bring that thing up right

342
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:16,519
come up bring that thing up right
 

343
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,750
come up bring that thing up right
away third Point let's make this more so

344
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:20,760
away third Point let's make this more so
 

345
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,190
away third Point let's make this more so
that you understand a projection okay so

346
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,200
that you understand a projection okay so
 

347
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,870
that you understand a projection okay so
because you're hitting with Coq you're

348
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:25,880
because you're hitting with Coq you're
 

349
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,350
because you're hitting with Coq you're
not just hitting with your stick so as

350
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,360
not just hitting with your stick so as
 

351
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,269
not just hitting with your stick so as
you come in

352
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:30,279
you come in
 

353
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,750
you come in
when I hit you I'm always in a neutral

354
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:34,760
when I hit you I'm always in a neutral
 

355
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,990
when I hit you I'm always in a neutral
stance I'm in a neutral stance when I

356
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,000
stance I'm in a neutral stance when I
 

357
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,030
stance I'm in a neutral stance when I
make contact always on the ski so I have

358
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
make contact always on the ski so I have
 

359
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,750
make contact always on the ski so I have
my 50/50 that's where I make contact and

360
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:44,760
my 50/50 that's where I make contact and
 

361
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,949
my 50/50 that's where I make contact and
the back foot is already engaging the

362
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:47,959
the back foot is already engaging the
 

363
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,110
the back foot is already engaging the
projection line okay so give me some

364
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,120
projection line okay so give me some
 

365
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,790
projection line okay so give me some
mask boom and you'll see that I'm

366
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
mask boom and you'll see that I'm
 

367
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,150
mask boom and you'll see that I'm
already grounded here he he can't push

368
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,160
already grounded here he he can't push
 

369
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,310
already grounded here he he can't push
me back and then what I do is shift my

370
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,320
me back and then what I do is shift my
 

371
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,670
me back and then what I do is shift my
wait for the cou

372
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:04,680

 

373
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,310

projection

374
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
projection
 

375
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,190
projection
don't in this drill don't hit him on the

376
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,200
don't in this drill don't hit him on the
 

377
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,550
don't in this drill don't hit him on the
front foot you you put your weight on

378
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
front foot you you put your weight on
 

379
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,949
front foot you you put your weight on
the front foot that's not the technique

380
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
the front foot that's not the technique
 

381
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,870
the front foot that's not the technique
ever but

382
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880

 

383
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,630

likewise don't go here and then just

384
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
likewise don't go here and then just
 

385
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,470
likewise don't go here and then just
push with your bracelet angle there's a

386
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:25,480
push with your bracelet angle there's a
 

387
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,550
push with your bracelet angle there's a
projection there no different grab

388
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:29,560
projection there no different grab
 

389
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,910
projection there no different grab
okay no different he's pushing and it's

390
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
okay no different he's pushing and it's
 

391
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,550
okay no different he's pushing and it's
time to shift my weight boom and I

392
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
time to shift my weight boom and I
 

393
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,829
time to shift my weight boom and I
project on there it's not that I just

394
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:36,839
project on there it's not that I just
 

395
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,069
project on there it's not that I just
shift my weight and make him go

396
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
shift my weight and make him go
 

397
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,629
shift my weight and make him go
backwards okay so same thing in the

398
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:42,639
backwards okay so same thing in the
 

399
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,069
backwards okay so same thing in the
drill boom hop I hit in the neutral

400
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079
drill boom hop I hit in the neutral
 

401
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,110
drill boom hop I hit in the neutral
50/50 and then project pop you should

402
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
50/50 and then project pop you should
 

403
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,629
50/50 and then project pop you should
get that pop on

404
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:55,639

 

405
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,790

him hit on the neutral project

406
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
him hit on the neutral project
 

407
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,670
him hit on the neutral project
okay here we go uh you know we're just

408
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
okay here we go uh you know we're just
 

409
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,750
okay here we go uh you know we're just
going to look at Mass okay so on target

410
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:06,760
going to look at Mass okay so on target
 

411
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,230
going to look at Mass okay so on target
the target because of its

412
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
the target because of its
 

413
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,470
the target because of its
mass it's friction with the ground it's

414
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:13,480
mass it's friction with the ground it's
 

415
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,190
mass it's friction with the ground it's
grav gravitational pull down it is

416
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
grav gravitational pull down it is
 

417
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,750
grav gravitational pull down it is
resistance okay it's not like a video

418
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:18,760
resistance okay it's not like a video
 

419
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,550
resistance okay it's not like a video
game that has no resistance to it it is

420
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:21,560
game that has no resistance to it it is
 

421
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,829
game that has no resistance to it it is
resistance okay and if my goal is to

422
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:24,839
resistance okay and if my goal is to
 

423
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,150
resistance okay and if my goal is to
displace it as it is in this case um I

424
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,160
displace it as it is in this case um I
 

425
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,069
displace it as it is in this case um I
have to overcome the resistance

426
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:33,079
have to overcome the resistance
 

427
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,910
have to overcome the resistance
okay and the way that you displace the

428
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
okay and the way that you displace the
 

429
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,110
okay and the way that you displace the
mass here is the way you displace the

430
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,120
mass here is the way you displace the
 

431
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,190
mass here is the way you displace the
mass always so its resistance is Yang

432
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
mass always so its resistance is Yang
 

433
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,430
mass always so its resistance is Yang
aspect I ground the Yang aspect it

434
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:44,440
aspect I ground the Yang aspect it
 

435
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,150
aspect I ground the Yang aspect it
bounces off the ground Vector foot so I

436
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,160
bounces off the ground Vector foot so I
 

437
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,710
bounces off the ground Vector foot so I
internalize it it bounces off the ground

438
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,720
internalize it it bounces off the ground
 

439
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,990
internalize it it bounces off the ground
Vector foot I internalize it again and I

440
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,000
Vector foot I internalize it again and I
 

441
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,190
Vector foot I internalize it again and I
send it out okay that that is why I

442
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,200
send it out okay that that is why I
 

443
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,110
send it out okay that that is why I
showed the the same exact thing so here

444
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
showed the the same exact thing so here
 

445
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,150
showed the the same exact thing so here
the Yang aspect is his spinal

446
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,160
the Yang aspect is his spinal
 

447
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,949
the Yang aspect is his spinal
displacement that he's trying to do okay

448
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:03,959
displacement that he's trying to do okay
 

449
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,910
displacement that he's trying to do okay
but it also includes his Mass uh as I

450
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:06,920
but it also includes his Mass uh as I
 

451
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,829
but it also includes his Mass uh as I
just described it so I ground Vector the

452
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:10,839
just described it so I ground Vector the
 

453
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,670
just described it so I ground Vector the
the Yang aspect I let it bounce off and

454
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:14,680
the Yang aspect I let it bounce off and
 

455
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,350
the Yang aspect I let it bounce off and
I project it back out so it is being

456
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
I project it back out so it is being
 

457
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,430
I project it back out so it is being
internalized one way and internalized

458
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440
internalized one way and internalized
 

459
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,790
internalized one way and internalized
out the other way okay um it's just

460
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:23,800
out the other way okay um it's just
 

461
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,710
out the other way okay um it's just
coincidental that the it's the back foot

462
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
coincidental that the it's the back foot
 

463
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,470
coincidental that the it's the back foot
that's the ground vector it could have

464
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,480
that's the ground vector it could have
 

465
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,389
that's the ground vector it could have
been the front foot I could have been on

466
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:31,399
been the front foot I could have been on
 

467
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,509
been the front foot I could have been on
one foot it doesn't does that's not

468
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
one foot it doesn't does that's not
 

469
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,990
one foot it doesn't does that's not
important okay um but the structural

470
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,000
important okay um but the structural
 

471
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,350
important okay um but the structural
mechanisms are internalize the Yang

472
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:40,360
mechanisms are internalize the Yang
 

473
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,790
mechanisms are internalize the Yang
aspect coming from out in back down to

474
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
aspect coming from out in back down to
 

475
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,670
aspect coming from out in back down to
the Earth so back out then back in again

476
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
the Earth so back out then back in again
 

477
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,030
the Earth so back out then back in again
and then back along whatever line of

478
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
and then back along whatever line of
 

479
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,430
and then back along whatever line of
attack I wanted to use okay um if we

480
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
attack I wanted to use okay um if we
 

481
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,110
attack I wanted to use okay um if we
have the normal

482
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120

 

483
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,389

ski it's the same thing so a lot of

484
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
ski it's the same thing so a lot of
 

485
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,829
ski it's the same thing so a lot of
people in ch's organization they do what

486
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:02,839
people in ch's organization they do what
 

487
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,910
people in ch's organization they do what
I call counting coup is uh you know you

488
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:06,920

really have skeletal alignment go ahead
and push on the Joe angle and you see

590
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:15,079
and push on the Joe angle and you see
 

591
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,629
and push on the Joe angle and you see
that I'm not in the right place for that

grip is often times a Nel I'm doing Nel
to my own hand here and so just put push

598
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:28,920
to my own hand here and so just put push
 

599
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,030
to my own hand here and so just put push
down on the weapon push down on the

600
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
down on the weapon push down on the
 

601
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,990
down on the weapon push down on the
weapon and it's hard for me to hold that

602
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
weapon and it's hard for me to hold that
 

603
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,749
weapon and it's hard for me to hold that
thing there okay the resistance of the

604
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
thing there okay the resistance of the
 

605
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,509
thing there okay the resistance of the
target can do all of what I just did

606
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:38,519
target can do all of what I just did

showing with his Force line
 

609
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,790
showing with his Force line
okay um and then usually what they do is

610
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:45,800
okay um and then usually what they do is
 

611
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,710
okay um and then usually what they do is
they hit on that foot on the foot coming

they hit on that foot on the foot coming
 

613
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,670
they hit on that foot on the foot coming
in so there's really no

614
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:54,680
in so there's really no
 

615
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,230
in so there's really no
penetration uh if I move that over here

616
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,240
penetration uh if I move that over here
 

617
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,790
penetration uh if I move that over here
you can see I'm just on the the surface

618
00:15:59,790 --> 00:15:59,800
you can see I'm just on the the surface
 

619
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,269
you can see I'm just on the the surface
like I'm tagging a shark or counting

coup um and they don't realize that some
of some of the things that you would

624
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
of some of the things that you would
 

625
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,350
of some of the things that you would
need is you have to overcome the initial

626
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
need is you have to overcome the initial
 

627
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,470
need is you have to overcome the initial
resistance of the target itself if we go

628
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
resistance of the target itself if we go
 

629

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,230
is where a lot of people think this is
this is striking range don't move your

642
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
this is striking range don't move your
 

643
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,710
this is striking range don't move your
hand this is striking range but that's

644
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
hand this is striking range but that's
 

645
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,829
hand this is striking range but that's
counting coup okay and I never hit the

646
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:40,839
counting coup okay and I never hit the
 

647
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,749
counting coup okay and I never hit the
target at the end of whatever I'm doing

648
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
target at the end of whatever I'm doing

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,189
target at the end of whatever I'm doing
with my hand I always hit the target in

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm going to hit here
 

661
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,189
I'm going to hit here
boom and once I drive the target

662
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:08,199
boom and once I drive the target
 

663
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,870
boom and once I drive the target
out here push on it push on the weapon

664
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:11,880
out here push on it push on the weapon
 

665
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,590
out here push on it push on the weapon
push hard you can see I'm just ground

666
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:14,600
push hard you can see I'm just ground
 

667
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,350
push hard you can see I'm just ground
vectoring again and then I shift my

668
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
vectoring again and then I shift my
 

669
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,390
vectoring again and then I shift my
weight and that's at the end where that

670
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
weight and that's at the end where that
 

671
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,270
weight and that's at the end where that
thing that Cha's das's finished with

of your cycle of action you
 

683
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,909

actually will not get that Target

684
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
actually will not get that Target
 

685
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,909
actually will not get that Target
depending on the target you you might

depending on the target you you might
 

687
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,150
depending on the target you you might
not ever get that foot down a lot of

00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
gravity here okay but if he has the
 

693
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,510

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,320
going to get his weight and it's going
 

705
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,390
going to get his weight and it's going
to hit me he's up in the air and he's

706
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,400
to hit me he's up in the air and he's
 

707
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,070
to hit me he's up in the air and he's
going to get his weight there but if I'm

708
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,080
going to get his weight there but if I'm
 

709
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,270
going to get his weight there but if I'm
moving at him he's he's not going to get

710
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
moving at him he's he's not going to get
 

711
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,990
moving at him he's he's not going to get
that foot down okay so that has to be

712
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,000
that foot down okay so that has to be
 

713
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,470
that foot down okay so that has to be
the order then and the order is that I

714
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
the order then and the order is that I
 

715
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,029
the order then and the order is that I
hit from a

716
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:26,039
hit from a
 

717
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,390

718
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400

old boom thrusting action that I then

720
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
old boom thrusting action that I then
 

721
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,110
old boom thrusting action that I then
feel the resistance rebound it off the

722
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
feel the resistance rebound it off the
 

723
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,510
feel the resistance rebound it off the
back foot and that's where I get the CQ

724
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
back foot and that's where I get the CQ
 

725
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,789
back foot and that's where I get the CQ
projection and that's what we're talking

726
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:41,799
projection and that's what we're talking
 

727
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,510
projection and that's what we're talking
about here it's no different here even

728
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
about here it's no different here even
 

729
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,270
about here it's no different here even
though the hand movement is not being

730
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,280
though the hand movement is not being
 

731
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,830
though the hand movement is not being
utilized so when I come up I'm first

732
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:50,840
utilized so when I come up I'm first
 

733
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,830
utilized so when I come up I'm first
going to hit boom at that level

734
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
going to hit boom at that level
 

735
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,110

759
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,789

and we know the

00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
and we know the
 

761
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,070
and we know the
my on the

my on the
Joe so he goes and we're going to

764
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:43,799
Joe so he goes and we're going to
 

765
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,510
Joe so he goes and we're going to
reverse engineer the

766
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:46,520
reverse engineer the
 

767
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,190
reverse engineer the
mai on the Kessa okay so now he

768
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,200
mai on the Kessa okay so now he
 

769
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,110
mai on the Kessa okay so now he
goes cool he goes down I absorb slow

770
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
goes cool he goes down I absorb slow
 

771
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,350
goes cool he goes down I absorb slow
down I absor absorb same way we've been

772
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,360
down I absor absorb same way we've been
 

773
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,909
down I absor absorb same way we've been
doing so go back rewind he's trying to

774
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
doing so go back rewind he's trying to
 

775
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,630
doing so go back rewind he's trying to
hit the hands I absorb so he doesn't hit

776
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,640
hit the hands I absorb so he doesn't hit
 

777
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,310
hit the hands I absorb so he doesn't hit
the hands he's just I go with it okay

778
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,320
the hands he's just I go with it okay
 

779
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,190
the hands he's just I go with it okay
his weapon goes up the tip goes up too I

780
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
his weapon goes up the tip goes up too I
 

781
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,470
his weapon goes up the tip goes up too I
stay with it okay leave your tip up

782
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
stay with it okay leave your tip up
 

783
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,750
stay with it okay leave your tip up
don't leave it down cuz it'll go around

784
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:22,760
don't leave it down cuz it'll go around
 

785
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,990
don't leave it down cuz it'll go around
the outside and I don't want him to do

786
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,000
the outside and I don't want him to do
 

787
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,470
the outside and I don't want him to do
that I want him to come in the way he

788
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
that I want him to come in the way he
 

789
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,750
that I want him to come in the way he
was coming in so he's going to come

790
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
was coming in so he's going to come
 

791
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,909
was coming in so he's going to come
in good stay there and here's where he

792
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
in good stay there and here's where he
 

793
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,710
in good stay there and here's where he
would shift his

794
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:37,720
would shift his
 

795
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,390
would shift his
weight

796
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,400
weight
 

797
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,510
weight
okay here's now where I come

798
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:42,520
okay here's now where I come
 

799
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,350
okay here's now where I come
forward inside and I would do the same

800
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,360
forward inside and I would do the same
 

801
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,110
forward inside and I would do the same
thing so here I hit that horse dance and

802
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,120
thing so here I hit that horse dance and
 

803
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,590
thing so here I hit that horse dance and
then I shift my weight boom and

804
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:56,600

 

805
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,310

hit so you you can

806
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,320

00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:43,559
okay is the person has this torso lean
 

975
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,789
okay is the person has this torso lean
they're throwing out but they're leaning

976
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:45,799
they're throwing out but they're leaning
 

977
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,110
they're throwing out but they're leaning
forward okay and you were even more in

978
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,120
forward okay and you were even more in
 

979
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,549
forward okay and you were even more in
the technique there you go okay you do

980
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
the technique there you go okay you do
 

981
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,430
the technique there you go okay you do
this all the time that's how I need to

982
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,440
this all the time that's how I need to
 

983
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,149
this all the time that's how I need to
call you okay but if you

984
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:55,159
call you okay but if you
 

985
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,510
call you okay but if you
look this this Vector here is the

986
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:58,520
look this this Vector here is the
 

987
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,149
look this this Vector here is the
shikaku the de angle okay and so her

988
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:03,159
shikaku the de angle okay and so her
 

989
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,990
shikaku the de angle okay and so her
mass is falling on the shikaku which is

990
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,000
mass is falling on the shikaku which is
 

991
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,310
mass is falling on the shikaku which is
why she has to step out of it all the

992
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,320
why she has to step out of it all the
 

993
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,029
why she has to step out of it all the
time okay all right so um we'll have you

994
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:14,039
time okay all right so um we'll have you
 

995
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:14,950
time okay all right so um we'll have you
come

996
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
come
 

997
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,230
come
out and we use you again you have your

998
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,240
out and we use you again you have your
 

999
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,029
out and we use you again you have your
uh bing of your joke let's

1000
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:22,039
uh bing of your joke let's
 

1001
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,350
uh bing of your joke let's
go because this is what you were doing

1002
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
go because this is what you were doing
 

1003
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,190
go because this is what you were doing
it's very common is someone is going to

1004
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
it's very common is someone is going to
 

1005
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,430
it's very common is someone is going to
be OB here like that okay very very

1006
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,440

 

1007
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,830

calm slow slow slow slow good nice and

1008
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
calm slow slow slow slow good nice and
 

1009
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,830
calm slow slow slow slow good nice and
slow good big step cool all right so

1010
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
slow good big step cool all right so
 

1011
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,510
slow good big step cool all right so
here

1012
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
here
 

1013
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,510
here
again um if the camera comes behind

1014
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,520
again um if the camera comes behind
 

1015
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,789
again um if the camera comes behind
me you can see that he's trying to

1016
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:51,799
me you can see that he's trying to
 

1017
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,710
me you can see that he's trying to
impact the target but his impact line is

1018
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:55,720
impact the target but his impact line is
 

1019
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,070
impact the target but his impact line is
cutting through the Chicago

1020
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,080
cutting through the Chicago
 

1021
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,029
cutting through the Chicago
okay and as he shifts his weight go

1022
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:02,039
okay and as he shifts his weight go
 

1023
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,870
okay and as he shifts his weight go
ahead and do it like you were doing it

1024
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:03,880
ahead and do it like you were doing it
 

1025
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,190
ahead and do it like you were doing it
and he rotates there stay where you are

1026
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:06,200
and he rotates there stay where you are
 

1027
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,070
and he rotates there stay where you are
you were fine nothing you can see it's

1028
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,080
you were fine nothing you can see it's
 

1029
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,630
you were fine nothing you can see it's
the same thing so here when he hits the

1030
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:11,640
the same thing so here when he hits the
 

1031
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,669
the same thing so here when he hits the
target boom and the target offers its

1032
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:14,679
target boom and the target offers its
 

1033
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,149
target boom and the target offers its
resistance penetration is going to be

1034
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:17,159
resistance penetration is going to be
 

1035
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,070
resistance penetration is going to be
decreased because he has to rebound off

1036
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
decreased because he has to rebound off
 

1037
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,510
decreased because he has to rebound off
the target okay um and when you're

1038
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
the target okay um and when you're
 

1039
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,909
the target okay um and when you're
hitting something for real at this angle

1040
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
hitting something for real at this angle
 

1041
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,789
hitting something for real at this angle
which does not feel like an angle to you

1042
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:29,799
which does not feel like an angle to you
 

1043
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,590
which does not feel like an angle to you
okay so if I'm here at that angle and

1044
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:32,600
okay so if I'm here at that angle and
 

1045
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,149
okay so if I'm here at that angle and
I'll put my hand there and I extend the

1046
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
I'll put my hand there and I extend the
 

1047
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,950
I'll put my hand there and I extend the
that Force Vector it compromises the the

1048
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:39,960
that Force Vector it compromises the the
 

1049
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,389
that Force Vector it compromises the the
lack of the skeletal alignment even more

1050
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
lack of the skeletal alignment even more
 

1051
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,110
lack of the skeletal alignment even more
and generates this rotation so as you

1052
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
and generates this rotation so as you
 

1053
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,310
and generates this rotation so as you
feel the resistance of the target the

1054
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,320
feel the resistance of the target the
 

1055
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,149
feel the resistance of the target the
shikaku line gets even worse do you see

1056
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
shikaku line gets even worse do you see
 

1057
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,950
shikaku line gets even worse do you see
it's not as it's not is just it's not

1058
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:52,960
it's not as it's not is just it's not
 

1059
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,669
it's not as it's not is just it's not
just that okay it's and you're gone and

1060
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
just that okay it's and you're gone and
 

1061
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,950
just that okay it's and you're gone and
then I don't get hit or I go ah

1062
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
then I don't get hit or I go ah
 

1063
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,669
then I don't get hit or I go ah
now you're dead Okay so you have to make

1064
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:04,679
now you're dead Okay so you have to make
 

1065
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,389
now you're dead Okay so you have to make
sure that you're in

1066
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:07,399
sure that you're in
 

1067
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:12,669
sure that you're in
alignment for that back foot to be your

1068
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:12,679
alignment for that back foot to be your
 

1069
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,909
alignment for that back foot to be your
ground vectoring projection do you see

1070
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:14,919
ground vectoring projection do you see
 

1071
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,070
ground vectoring projection do you see
that okay so stay there make it

1072
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
that okay so stay there make it
 

1073
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,830
that okay so stay there make it
[Music]

1074
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
[Music]
 

1075
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,710

hard okay that's what you want to hit me

1076
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
hard okay that's what you want to hit me
 

1077
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,389
hard okay that's what you want to hit me
with careful you don't overr rotate that

1078
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
with careful you don't overr rotate that
 

1079
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,470
with careful you don't overr rotate that
hip you see that okay we know what'll

1080
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
hip you see that okay we know what'll
 

1081
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,789
hip you see that okay we know what'll
happen if you ttin on the back foot you

1082
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:35,799
happen if you ttin on the back foot you
 

1083
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,789
happen if you ttin on the back foot you
actually move off the Target and so you

1084
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:37,799
actually move off the Target and so you
 

1085
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,430
actually move off the Target and so you
don't have the displacement penetration

1086
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,440
don't have the displacement penetration
 

1087
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,630
don't have the displacement penetration
okay but you can't over rotate that hit

1088
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:43,640
okay but you can't over rotate that hit
 

1089
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,590
okay but you can't over rotate that hit
either cuz you're going to miss and

1090
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
either cuz you're going to miss and
 

1091
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,630
either cuz you're going to miss and
you're going to be off balance okay now

1092
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
you're going to be off balance okay now
 

1093
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,750
you're going to be off balance okay now
why do people do that because they're

1094
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
why do people do that because they're
 

1095
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,909
why do people do that because they're
trying to go around so let's get to the

1096
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
trying to go around so let's get to the
 

1097
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,990
trying to go around so let's get to the
last

1098
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
last
 

1099
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,110
last
movement now let's start over

1100
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
movement now let's start over
 

1101
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,870
movement now let's start over
please come on here we

1102
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:01,880
please come on here we
 

1103
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,549
please come on here we
go okay yeah you could already see he's

1104
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:05,559
go okay yeah you could already see he's
 

1105
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,110
go okay yeah you could already see he's
trying to get around this thing and you

1106
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,120
trying to get around this thing and you
 

1107
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,470
trying to get around this thing and you
don't want to do that you that and that

1108
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
don't want to do that you that and that
 

1109
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,190
don't want to do that you that and that
is common because you're like yikes I

1110
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:14,200
is common because you're like yikes I
 

1111
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,710
is common because you're like yikes I
don't want to get hit by that thing okay

1112
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
don't want to get hit by that thing okay
 

1113
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,789
don't want to get hit by that thing okay
and so you're trying to go on the side

1114
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
and so you're trying to go on the side
 

1115
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,350
and so you're trying to go on the side
of the weapon camera over there okay so

1116
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,360
of the weapon camera over there okay so
 

1117
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,669
of the weapon camera over there okay so
on his first little deviation that he

1118
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:24,679
on his first little deviation that he
 

1119
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,110
on his first little deviation that he
did with his hips and requiring him to

1120
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
did with his hips and requiring him to
 

1121
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,669
did with his hips and requiring him to
move his foot he's moved to this side of

1122
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:30,679
move his foot he's moved to this side of
 

1123
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,029
move his foot he's moved to this side of
the Joe okay and people do that out of

1124
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:34,039
the Joe okay and people do that out of
 

1125
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,029
the Joe okay and people do that out of
fear because you in this technique

1126
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
fear because you in this technique
 

1127
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,669
fear because you in this technique
you're going inside the eye of the

1128
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:38,679
you're going inside the eye of the
 

1129
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,830
you're going inside the eye of the
