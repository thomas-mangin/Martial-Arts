Solutions um you now have to do things

26
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
Solutions um you now have to do things
 

27
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,069
Solutions um you now have to do things
that obviously don't make sense

28
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
that obviously don't make sense
 

29
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,990
that obviously don't make sense
martially but again um energetically

30
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
martially but again um energetically

which is the main point of kihon waza uh
 

33
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,229
which is the main point of kihon waza uh
you you will have a harder time

34
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
you you will have a harder time
 

35
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,910
you you will have a harder time
especially if you

36
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
especially if you
 

37
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,430
especially if you
are not yet skilled in the energetic

38
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
are not yet skilled in the energetic
 

39
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,990
are not yet skilled in the energetic
aspects you will have a harder time

40
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
aspects you will have a harder time
 

41
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,230
aspects you will have a harder time
trying to accomplish energetically what

42
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
trying to accomplish energetically what
 

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,429
trying to accomplish energetically what
you're trying to accomplish by somebody

44
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:08,439
you're trying to accomplish by somebody
 

45
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,190
you're trying to accomplish by somebody
who just stands there and grabs you okay

46
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
who just stands there and grabs you okay
 

47
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,230
who just stands there and grabs you okay
so the question is well I don't want to

48
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,240
so the question is well I don't want to
 

49
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,749
so the question is well I don't want to
do that I'd like to make Marshall sense

50
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
do that I'd like to make Marshall sense
 

51
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,950
do that I'd like to make Marshall sense
and or I'd like to have the energetic

52
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:17,960
and or I'd like to have the energetic
 

53
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,149
and or I'd like to have the energetic
aspects being cultivated in my hea what

54
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
aspects being cultivated in my hea what
 

55
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,350
aspects being cultivated in my hea what
do I do okay uh the first solution I

56
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
do I do okay uh the first solution I
 

57
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,030
do I do okay uh the first solution I
would say is tell them to push like just

58
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,040
would say is tell them to push like just
 

59
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,870
would say is tell them to push like just
say hey can you push a little

60
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
say hey can you push a little
 

61
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,630
say hey can you push a little
but maybe your teacher will go come

62
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
but maybe your teacher will go come
 

63
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,190
but maybe your teacher will go come
around like it depends on where you are

64
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
around like it depends on where you are
 

65
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,230
around like it depends on where you are
in the social hierarchy your teacher

66
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
in the social hierarchy your teacher
 

67
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,910
in the social hierarchy your teacher
will come around and go I don't want you

68
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
will come around and go I don't want you
 

69
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,630
will come around and go I don't want you
to push I want you to Bear down and and

70
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
to push I want you to Bear down and and
 

71
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,550
to push I want you to Bear down and and
and crank down like you know if you were

72
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
and crank down like you know if you were
 

73
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,550
and crank down like you know if you were
in a iwama do or something like that um

74
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
in a iwama do or something like that um
 

75
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,870
in a iwama do or something like that um
okay the next solution I would go to is

76
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
okay the next solution I would go to is
 

77
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,830
okay the next solution I would go to is
get a friend make a friend and train in

78
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
get a friend make a friend and train in
 

79
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,310
get a friend make a friend and train in
the right way outside of dojo class

80
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
the right way outside of dojo class
 

81
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,630
the right way outside of dojo class
structure okay and as you climb in rank

82
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
structure okay and as you climb in rank
 

83
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,109
structure okay and as you climb in rank
which you will cuz is just hang out long

84
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
which you will cuz is just hang out long
 

85
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,950
which you will cuz is just hang out long
enough uh as you climb in rank and as

86
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
enough uh as you climb in rank and as
 

87
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,950
enough uh as you climb in rank and as
you get Social Power social capital in

88
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
you get Social Power social capital in
 

89
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,270
you get Social Power social capital in
there uh and it's your turn to run some

90
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
there uh and it's your turn to run some
 

91
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,630
there uh and it's your turn to run some
classes you can run classes like that

92
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
classes you can run classes like that
 

93
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,990
classes you can run classes like that
that would be my next option all right

94
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
that would be my next option all right
 

95
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,030
that would be my next option all right
and then uh if you're like well that's

96
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
and then uh if you're like well that's
 

97
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,430
and then uh if you're like well that's
not going to work or that's going to

98
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
not going to work or that's going to
 

99
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,750
not going to work or that's going to
take a while um I guess the other option

100
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,760
take a while um I guess the other option
 

101
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,509
take a while um I guess the other option
is move go to another Dojo i' try that

102
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:23,519
is move go to another Dojo i' try that
 

103
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,270
is move go to another Dojo i' try that
one next uh but okay none of that's

104
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,280
one next uh but okay none of that's
 

105
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,350
one next uh but okay none of that's
working okay here's what you can do okay

106
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,360
working okay here's what you can do okay
 

107
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,750
working okay here's what you can do okay
so uh I have to tell my UK what to do CU

we don't do this so let me get him into
 

111
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,589
we don't do this so let me get him into
ballpark you're just you're just going

112
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:38,599
ballpark you're just you're just going
 

113
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,270
ballpark you're just you're just going
to stay still with no pressure there you

114
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
to stay still with no pressure there you
 

115
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,750
to stay still with no pressure there you
go okay I will go back out of range okay

116
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:44,760
go okay I will go back out of range okay
 

117
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,589
go okay I will go back out of range okay
so everyone who does that just like

118
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
so everyone who does that just like
 

119
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,710
so everyone who does that just like
anyone

120
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
anyone
 

121
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,030
anyone
else they have a a a precognition of

122
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,040
else they have a a a precognition of
 

123
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,030

where they're going to land and do that
 

125
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,350
where they're going to land and do that
grip from from out there do you get it

126
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
grip from from out there do you get it
 

127
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,670
grip from from out there do you get it
so if my hand is there he's going to

128
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
so if my hand is there he's going to
 

129
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,270
so if my hand is there he's going to
look at it and his body mind is telling

130
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,280
look at it and his body mind is telling
 

131
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,110
look at it and his body mind is telling
him that's where I'm going to close my

132
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
him that's where I'm going to close my
 

133
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,509
him that's where I'm going to close my
hand okay so like with all things that

134
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:12,519
hand okay so like with all things that
 

135
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,309
hand okay so like with all things that
we want to do when we use iy uh the

136
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
we want to do when we use iy uh the
 

137
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,190
we want to do when we use iy uh the
adhesion cannot it has to remain at

138
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
adhesion cannot it has to remain at
 

139
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,550
adhesion cannot it has to remain at
neutral yangong so it's deviations and

140
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:23,560
neutral yangong so it's deviations and
 

141
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,949
neutral yangong so it's deviations and
whatever Vector that I use it has to be

142
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:25,959
whatever Vector that I use it has to be
 

143
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,710
whatever Vector that I use it has to be
gradual if you make sharp angles or

144
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
gradual if you make sharp angles or
 

145
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,670
gradual if you make sharp angles or
reverse angles you're going to go

146
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:30,680
reverse angles you're going to go
 

147
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,789
reverse angles you're going to go
positive Y and you're going to lose the

148
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
positive Y and you're going to lose the
 

149
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,710
positive Y and you're going to lose the
adhesion okay um so we're going to use

150
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
adhesion okay um so we're going to use
 

151
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,070
adhesion okay um so we're going to use
that concept here I'm not going to call

152
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
that concept here I'm not going to call
 

153
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,670
that concept here I'm not going to call
it I myself um of just

154
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:42,680
it I myself um of just
 

155
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,070
it I myself um of just
gradual um addressing of what you're

156
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
gradual um addressing of what you're
 

157
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,670
gradual um addressing of what you're
doing okay so as he goes to do that I

158
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
doing okay so as he goes to do that I
 

159
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,670
doing okay so as he goes to do that I
got that little

160
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680

 

161
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,110

movement

162
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120

 

163
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,869

stay there where you are do you feel how

164
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
stay there where you are do you feel how
 

165
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,390
stay there where you are do you feel how
your weight shifted on your on your

166
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,400
your weight shifted on your on your
 

167
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,630
your weight shifted on your on your
front leg now yes you feel that yes okay

168
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
front leg now yes you feel that yes okay
 

169
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,509
front leg now yes you feel that yes okay
so

170
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:12,519
so
 

171
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,630
so
um as opposed to he comes in I stay here

172
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:15,640
um as opposed to he comes in I stay here
 

173
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,949
um as opposed to he comes in I stay here
he's he's grounded he's actually falling

174
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:17,959
he's he's grounded he's actually falling
 

175
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,830
he's he's grounded he's actually falling
backwards on that foot okay uh but this

176
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
backwards on that foot okay uh but this
 

177
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,150
backwards on that foot okay uh but this
would be equally wrong you go like this

178
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,160
would be equally wrong you go like this
 

179
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,790
would be equally wrong you go like this
the people are going to stop because you

180
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
the people are going to stop because you
 

181
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,990
the people are going to stop because you
radically change where they wanted to

182
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
radically change where they wanted to
 

183
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,230
radically change where they wanted to
land okay so that that would be one way

184
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,240
land okay so that that would be one way
 

185
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,390
land okay so that that would be one way
to do it it's just sure there you just I

186
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
to do it it's just sure there you just I
 

187
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,830
to do it it's just sure there you just I
just did it okay you had a little bit of

188
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
just did it okay you had a little bit of
 

189
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,510
just did it okay you had a little bit of
forward progress into the movement okay

190
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
forward progress into the movement okay
 

191
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,430
forward progress into the movement okay
uh the best way of doing that is to give

192
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
uh the best way of doing that is to give
 

193
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,029
uh the best way of doing that is to give
them the hand as bait uh like you would

194
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:49,039
them the hand as bait uh like you would
 

195
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,230
them the hand as bait uh like you would
in any number of weapons techniques so

196
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
in any number of weapons techniques so
 

197
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,469
in any number of weapons techniques so
I'm shifted on the front foot do you see

198
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:55,479
I'm shifted on the front foot do you see
 

199
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm shifted on the front foot do you see
where I am and as he comes in I shift on

200
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
where I am and as he comes in I shift on
 

201
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
where I am and as he comes in I shift on
that back fo foot and then you already

202
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
that back fo foot and then you already
 

203
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,590
that back fo foot and then you already
got enough weight to to do whatever you

204
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
got enough weight to to do whatever you
 

205
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,950
got enough weight to to do whatever you
wanted to do okay it's not going to be

206
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:07,960
wanted to do okay it's not going to be
 

207
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,710
wanted to do okay it's not going to be
right but as we already said I think

208
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
right but as we already said I think
 

209
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,510
right but as we already said I think
this is like the fifth option that I

210
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
this is like the fifth option that I
 

211
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,310
this is like the fifth option that I
gave you okay but it's better than

212
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
gave you okay but it's better than
 

213
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,710
gave you okay but it's better than
you're just standing here his weight

214
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
you're just standing here his weight
 

215
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,270
you're just standing here his weight
actually went back and then you're like

216
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
actually went back and then you're like
 

217
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,350
actually went back and then you're like
having to get back here to try to do

218
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
having to get back here to try to do
 

219
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,590
having to get back here to try to do
that same

220
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
that same
 

221
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,390
that same
okay

222
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400
okay
 

223
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,749
okay
um but the next best option and we I

224
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:30,759
um but the next best option and we I
 

225
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,390
um but the next best option and we I
have to use this all the time in here uh

226
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
have to use this all the time in here uh
 

227
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,390
have to use this all the time in here uh
because the beginner

228
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,400
because the beginner
 

229
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,710
because the beginner
UK gets scared as they get moved from

230
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
UK gets scared as they get moved from
 

231
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,790
UK gets scared as they get moved from
their Center and they will not spinally

232
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:43,800
their Center and they will not spinally
 

233
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,270
their Center and they will not spinally
displaced because they know uh that was

234
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
displaced because they know uh that was
 

235
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,189
displaced because they know uh that was
the Marshall opening for the for example

236
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:50,199
the Marshall opening for the for example
 

237
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,670
the Marshall opening for the for example
the nag waza and they start to resist

238
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
the nag waza and they start to resist
 

239
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,150
the nag waza and they start to resist
the nag waza from the get-go okay um so

240
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
the nag waza from the get-go okay um so
 

241
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,070
the nag waza from the get-go okay um so
the best option so he's he's going to

242
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
the best option so he's he's going to
 

243
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,110
the best option so he's he's going to
stay there okay is I will now Vector off

244
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,120
stay there okay is I will now Vector off
 

245
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,029
stay there okay is I will now Vector off
the front foot my ground Vector off the

246
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
the front foot my ground Vector off the
 

247
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,230
the front foot my ground Vector off the
front foot so normally you ground Vector

248
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
front foot so normally you ground Vector
 

249
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,029
front foot so normally you ground Vector
off the back foot cuz he's pushing and

250
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,039
off the back foot cuz he's pushing and
 

251
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,710
off the back foot cuz he's pushing and
you you need that back foot to to uh

252
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
you you need that back foot to to uh
 

253
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,589
you you need that back foot to to uh
make the connection but this time I'll

254
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:19,599
make the connection but this time I'll
 

255
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,270
make the connection but this time I'll
Vector off the front foot okay if I stay

256
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,280
Vector off the front foot okay if I stay
 

257
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,270
Vector off the front foot okay if I stay
on the back foot or neutral you see how

258
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
on the back foot or neutral you see how
 

259
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,589
on the back foot or neutral you see how
it's kind of dead but as I Vector off

260
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:26,599
it's kind of dead but as I Vector off
 

261
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,909
it's kind of dead but as I Vector off
the front foot and then then you have

262
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
the front foot and then then you have
 

263
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,909
the front foot and then then you have
him okay and you're Now using that

264
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
him okay and you're Now using that
 

265
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,469
him okay and you're Now using that
adhesion so you might have to change

266
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
adhesion so you might have to change
 

267
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,070
adhesion so you might have to change
some things as I come around this one

268
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,080
some things as I come around this one
 

269
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,589
some things as I come around this one
came that way and then you have the same

270
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:40,599
came that way and then you have the same
 

271
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,749
came that way and then you have the same
e

272
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
e
 

273
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,589
e
technique I don't know if that's the

274
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:43,599
technique I don't know if that's the
 

275
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,870
technique I don't know if that's the
best view camera so move wherever you

276
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:45,880
best view camera so move wherever you
 

277
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,110
best view camera so move wherever you
want so I'm Vector off the front foot

278
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
want so I'm Vector off the front foot
 

279
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,150
want so I'm Vector off the front foot
okay and you can combine the two so boom

280
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
okay and you can combine the two so boom
 

281
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,909
okay and you can combine the two so boom
I kind of got a little bit and then as

282
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
I kind of got a little bit and then as
 

283
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,909
I kind of got a little bit and then as
supposed to be entering over there for

284
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
supposed to be entering over there for
 

285
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,990
supposed to be entering over there for
the EO I use that foot to turn him into

286
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
the EO I use that foot to turn him into
 

287
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,950
the EO I use that foot to turn him into
that movement with that adhesion so

288
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:07,960
that movement with that adhesion so
 

289
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,869
that movement with that adhesion so
let's say he does not close his hand

290
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:10,879
let's say he does not close his hand
 

291
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:28,309
let's say he does not close his hand
okay and I do that same thing you see

292
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319

 

293
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,589

w't

294
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:32,599

 

295
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,510

if you're doing for

296
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,520
if you're doing for
 

297
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,150
if you're doing for
example like um uh any of the of the arm

298
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
example like um uh any of the of the arm
 

299
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,790
example like um uh any of the of the arm
passes

300
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:41,800
passes
 

301
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,589
passes
okay same thing so boom connection move

302
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
okay same thing so boom connection move
 

303
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,830
okay same thing so boom connection move
move and you just will bring him with

304
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
move and you just will bring him with
 

305
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,550
move and you just will bring him with
your adhesions into the spinal

306
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
your adhesions into the spinal
 

307
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,110
your adhesions into the spinal
displacement okay that he's moving

308
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
displacement okay that he's moving
 

309
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,110
displacement okay that he's moving
forward now so you could do tyel henle

310
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,120
forward now so you could do tyel henle
 

311
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,350
forward now so you could do tyel henle
for example and we know in ours he's

312
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
for example and we know in ours he's
 

313
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,589
for example and we know in ours he's
pushing and hence that's why I turn

314
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
pushing and hence that's why I turn
 

315
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,149
pushing and hence that's why I turn
because that's what makes sense when

316
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:05,159
because that's what makes sense when
 

317
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,710
because that's what makes sense when
someone pushes turn it does not make

318
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:07,720
someone pushes turn it does not make
 

319
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,790
someone pushes turn it does not make
sense to enter on someone who's pulling

320
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
sense to enter on someone who's pulling
 

321
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,550
sense to enter on someone who's pulling
or not pushing okay you don't you don't
