back in this action here you see that's
 

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,030
back in this action here you see that's
what happens when I do the turn the way

186
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
what happens when I do the turn the way
 

187
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,190
what happens when I do the turn the way
I'm saying to do it his elbow continues

188
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm saying to do it his elbow continues
 

189
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,509
I'm saying to do it his elbow continues
to go up

190
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:00,519
to go up
 

191
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,710
to go up
and back over the

192
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:03,720
and back over the
 

193
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,949
and back over the
top you guys see

194
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:05,959
top you guys see
 

195
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,269
top you guys see
that so now his hand therefore is going

196
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
that so now his hand therefore is going
 

197
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,710
that so now his hand therefore is going
down which is why I don't have to pull

198
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,720
down which is why I don't have to pull
 

199
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,710
down which is why I don't have to pull
his hand down okay so as you make his

200
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
his hand down okay so as you make his
 

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,550
his hand down okay so as you make his
elbow go up the more vertical the lower

202
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,560
elbow go up the more vertical the lower
 

203
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,110
elbow go up the more vertical the lower
that hand goes you see okay I don't have

204
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
that hand goes you see okay I don't have
 

205
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,230
that hand goes you see okay I don't have
to pull on the finger fingers once I

206
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,240
to pull on the finger fingers once I
 

207
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,949
to pull on the finger fingers once I
feel his

208
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
feel his
 

209
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,750
feel his
resistance I go over the fingers this

210
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
resistance I go over the fingers this
 

211
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,190
resistance I go over the fingers this
way make his elbow up more then it's

212
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,200

 

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,629

easy it makes no sense you're going to

214
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:44,639
easy it makes no sense you're going to
 

215
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,990
easy it makes no sense you're going to
do all this and then you're going to

216
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,000

 

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,590

go you have to go around the energy

218
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,600
go you have to go around the energy
 

219
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,389
go you have to go around the energy
Point

220
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399

who my hand just opens and Spills

222
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200

 

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,150

nothing in it okay if you're pulling

224
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,160
nothing in it okay if you're pulling
 

225
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,670
nothing in it okay if you're pulling
down on it you're just a

226
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,680
down on it you're just a
 

227
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,190
down on it you're just a
contester not doing the art go so every

228
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
contester not doing the art go so every
 

229
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,910
contester not doing the art go so every
time nine out of 10 times you taking

230
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
time nine out of 10 times you taking
 

231
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,110
time nine out of 10 times you taking
you're going to actually go

232
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,120
you're going to actually go
 

233
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,790
you're going to actually go
forward it's so you can get on the other

234
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
forward it's so you can get on the other
 

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,110
forward it's so you can get on the other
side of the resistance so we'll make it

236
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
side of the resistance so we'll make it
 

237
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,470
side of the resistance so we'll make it
more

238
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
more
 

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,509
more
obvious okay and when I step forward I

240
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
obvious okay and when I step forward I
 

241
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,030
obvious okay and when I step forward I
can get on the other side of that do you

242
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
can get on the other side of that do you
 

243
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,110
can get on the other side of that do you
see then you add his grip to it and his

244
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
see then you add his grip to it and his
 

245
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,030
see then you add his grip to it and his
grip turns with me I can get now I can

246
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
grip turns with me I can get now I can
 

247
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,910
grip turns with me I can get now I can
push straight down without the

248
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
push straight down without the
 

249
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,430
push straight down without the
resistance okay

250
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
resistance okay
 

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,069
resistance okay
so when I come over here for example

252
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
so when I come over here for example
 

253
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,230
so when I come over here for example
to lift that you can feel his weight

254
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,240
to lift that you can feel his weight
 

255
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,990
to lift that you can feel his weight
there so I don't I don't lift the hand

256
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
there so I don't I don't lift the hand
 

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,069
there so I don't I don't lift the hand
right I've moved myself under it you see

258
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
right I've moved myself under it you see
 

259
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,110
right I've moved myself under it you see
I'm under it then as I pass it it goes

260
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm under it then as I pass it it goes
 

261
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,550
I'm under it then as I pass it it goes
behind my head do you see it's behind my

262
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
behind my head do you see it's behind my
 

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,550
behind my head do you see it's behind my
head then I move out from under

264
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,560

 

265
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,629

it you already using this principle on

266
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
it you already using this principle on
 

267
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,550
it you already using this principle on
the first one

268
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
the first one
 

269
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,710
the first one
enter so you can get around the inertia

270
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
enter so you can get around the inertia
 

271
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:47,269
enter so you can get around the inertia
so enter up pass it it's behind me now

272
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279

 

273
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,870

see don't go like

274
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
see don't go like
 

275
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,870
see don't go like
this that's how we used to do it okay

276
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
this that's how we used to do it okay
 

277
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,230
this that's how we used to do it okay
one pushing passing go to the other side

278
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
one pushing passing go to the other side
 

279
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,110
one pushing passing go to the other side
same thing here don't cut down

280
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,120
same thing here don't cut down
 

281
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,509
same thing here don't cut down
here you're going to

282
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:06,519
here you're going to
 

283
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,189
here you're going to
enter you can come up a little you're

284
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:09,199
enter you can come up a little you're
 

285
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,310
enter you can come up a little you're
going to enter so I can get on the on

286
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,320
going to enter so I can get on the on
 

287
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,750
going to enter so I can get on the on
the other side of the finger resistance

288
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
the other side of the finger resistance
 

289
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:33,230
the other side of the finger resistance
so I'm on the other side

290
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240

 

291
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,990

this is something

292
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000

 

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,389

different and this is something

294
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399

 

295
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,629

different I'm stepping into the street

296
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:49,639
different I'm stepping into the street
 

297
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,639
different I'm stepping into the street
