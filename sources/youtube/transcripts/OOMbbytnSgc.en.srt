00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,230

so the reason I'm saying all this about

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,240
so the reason I'm saying all this about
 

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,950
so the reason I'm saying all this about
the costs and time spent

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
the costs and time spent
 

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,430
the costs and time spent
is for anybody who thinks that it's done

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,440
is for anybody who thinks that it's done
 

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,709
is for anybody who thinks that it's done
to make money

8
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
to make money
 

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,749
to make money
it's far from that

10
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:14,759
it's far from that
 

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,269
it's far from that
of course everybody needs

12
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
of course everybody needs

00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
so anyhow as long as I've covered my
 

23
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,669
so anyhow as long as I've covered my
costs

24

costs
 

25
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,569
costs
then I'm happy the first person to get

then I'm happy the first person to get
 

27
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,549
then I'm happy the first person to get
the certificate is um

the exact points so most people who
 

55
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,890
the exact points so most people who
received the Scrolls around the world

56
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:23,900

uh levels
 

91
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,630
uh levels
but you've got a list of points that you

92
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:17,640
but you've got a list of points that you
 

93
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,270
but you've got a list of points that you
need to look at on each one

94
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
need to look at on each one
 

95
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,710
need to look at on each one
then

96
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:21,720
then
 

97
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,650
then
before you get the fifth level you have

98
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:24,660
before you get the fifth level you have
 

99
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,970
before you get the fifth level you have
to either buy film or in front of me

100
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:27,980
to either buy film or in front of me
 

101
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,710
to either buy film or in front of me
show there's going to be obviously

102
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
show there's going to be obviously
 

103
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,309

broken down over a day
you're going to have to show me

106
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:36,840
you're going to have to show me
 

107
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,270
you're going to have to show me
all four levels in one one-off go

108
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
all four levels in one one-off go
 

109
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,089
all four levels in one one-off go
so let's just supposing that in three

110
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:44,099
so let's just supposing that in three
 

111
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,830
so let's just supposing that in three
four years time

112
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
four years time
 

113
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,890
four years time
somebody's got to all four levels

114
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:48,900
somebody's got to all four levels
 

115
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,830
somebody's got to all four levels
they've been working on the the points

116
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
they've been working on the the points
 

117
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,750
they've been working on the the points
that I've

118
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
that I've
 

119
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,930
that I've
given them with another certificate

120
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:56,940
given them with another certificate
 

121
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,350
given them with another certificate
to say that I'm I'm happy with what

122
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,360
to say that I'm I'm happy with what
 

123
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,530

they're doing but if they want to work

124
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:03,540
they're doing but if they want to work
 

125
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,910
they're doing but if they want to work
on their own

126

on their own
 

127
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,670
on their own
weaknesses like the thing on the end of

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
weaknesses like the thing on the end of
 

129
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,550
weaknesses like the thing on the end of
the Joe or the finger sticking out on

when they're holding the Joe
then

138
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:20,819
then
 

139
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,390
then
before they get the fifth certificate
