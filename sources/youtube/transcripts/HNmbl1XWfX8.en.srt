00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Today I was just awarded the
7th Dan.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,500
I received it from Doshu.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,320
What's very funny is that I had never attended a kagamibiraki,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,480
It was the first time, even though I'm 7th dan, I had never done it.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,860
It might make some people smile  because of my rank and everything ...

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,440
It's always intimidating to find yourself in this dojo, in this setup.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,820
And so here I was, very happy...

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,960
I couldn't thank all those who helped me progress in my life...

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Obviously it's mainly Christian Tissier, so I obviously thank him.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,740
When I started it was of course the Doshu, Osawa [Kisaburo] Sensei,

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,500
Masuda Sensei, who no longer participates in these things because I think he is too old.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,320
These are the people who have influenced my aikido a lot

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,280
and I thank them for what is happening to me today.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,620
What does this grade represent for you?

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
It's an important grade obviously.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,980
It's a result of all the work done.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,380
But in fact, beyond that, I started Aikido in Japan

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,800
so every time I come back here I feel like I'm going back to a place from my childhood,

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,580
and so today being in this dojo, where I worked a lot, where I sweated a lot,

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:27,220
it made me feel warm to find myself in this place for this 7th dan promotion.

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,480
It's a big responsibility.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,480
I already have a big responsibility because of the name I carry,

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,980
because being named Tissier is not always easy.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:44,260
Now that I'm a 7th dan, I can't afford to act poorly or speak poorly.

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,820
I have to show the way, I have to stay within the ranks somehow.

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,259
I didn't expect to reach this level one day, I must say things as they are.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,420
When I started at the Aikikai, I was 15 years old, so when I saw a 1st dan, for me it was already the top.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,800
So to climb the ladder like that and to arrive at this grade today...

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,180
I’m not going to say it was unwanted, because obviously everyone wants to get to the grade above,

30
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,440
but I never thought it would happen to me one day,

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,380
because I think I'm very close to my students,

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,240
I hope in any case that I'm not big headed and that my pupils know it.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,060
This is something very important for me.

34
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,620
In addition, my students were super nice,
it was really very warm.

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,100
It really warmed my heart.

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,140
From your beginnings to your promotion today, could you describe your relationship with the Hombu?

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:54,520
The grade of 7th Dan is given in the room which serves as the museum of the founder of Aikido.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,100
I was with Dohsu, my daughter was allowed to come in to take a photo.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,080
I had to bow, so I started to kneel,

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,920
but the Doshu said to me: "no, don't kneel down"

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,200
and he placed himself next to me he showed me what I had to do.

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,660
So that made my daughter smile a little, as well as the Dojo-cho, who was there.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,420
It was very nice, after he smiled and he even laughed a little,

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,240
because I was not really in the mold compared to what had been planned

45
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,800
But hey, it was very nice, it was very friendly.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,700
And then there are other anecdotes too, for example,

47
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,320
it was during the [1988 International Aikido Federation] congress in Tanabe.

48
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,410
There were local practitioners who weren't violent,

49
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,080
but they were a little bit harsh.

50
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,220
So in the evening I said to Christian, who had not attended the course:

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,020
"They're a little rough here."

52
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,500
I raised my right arm and I had five finger marks, bruises,

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,400
because we did Ikkyo and they grabbed my arm...

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,020
Christian must have told someone, I don't know who, perhaps Yasuno.

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,420
The next day, when I arrived at the seminar,

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,060
all the uchi deshi came to work with me,

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
10 minutes and every time it changed, they came to work with me

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,480
so that I didn't work with local people and so that I wasn't treated roughly.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,739
So that's it, all of which is to say that it's a big family.

60
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:23,260
Even if we don't see each other often, there is this link that is there.

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,200
Somehow, I feel a a bit like a child of the  Aikikai.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,800
I started here, Doshu has always known me...

63
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,440
because of the fact that Christian Tissier has become very famous.

64
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,100
But even now that we are no longer together, there is still this bond,

65
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,680
which is the bond of Aikido in general, because Aikido is a big family.

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,120
So there is always this link that is there.

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,480
I know when they say: "Micheline"...

68
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,640
as Yasuno said, I have a reputation at the Aikikai, and when we say Micheline, people know who it is.

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,400
So even though some people have never seen me, they know my name.

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,020
So that means that somehow, I managed to get

71
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,300
this reputation independently of Christian
Tissier,

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,650
my reputation comes from the fact that I trained at the Aikikai...

73
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,070
Because we came back every year for 22 years with Christian,

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,520
I trained, I was pushed by the uchi deshi, I didn't give up,

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,600
and so it all made me manage to make my own reputation at the Aikikai.

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,420
About the IAF, what is it like to be a teacher at the congress now?

77
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,180
It feels strange because actually, since I started at 15,

78
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,040
I attended every congress since 1976,

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,580
and it’s true that it’s really strange to be in front of the students,

80
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,140
at the congress, to give a lesson yourself.

81
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,420
My first reaction when I stepped inside was to tell myself:

82
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,560
"Hey, you got old because you're on the other side of the mirror."

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,460
And at the same time it was great,

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,860
to do a course like the one I did 3 years ago,

85
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,840
where there were almost 700 people on the tatami, it's very impressive.

86
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,660
But again, because I started here in Japan,

87
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,480
Osawa Sensei, who was at the entrance when I came in, said to me:

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,620
"Is your heart beating?"

89
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
I said, "Yes Sensei, my heart is beating."

90
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,060
He said, "Don't worry, you have a really good Sensei and it's going to be fine."

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,600
So that too, those small attentions...

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,160
If I hadn't started Aikido in Japan...

93
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,340
I think that the Sensei: Osawa Sensei, Miyamoto Sensei, Yasuno Sensei,

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,060
they liked me then and they still like me,

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,140
so they are always there to support me, as they did when I was younger.

96
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,200
So it’s also nice to find friends who are there,

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
with a strong link, so it's good.
