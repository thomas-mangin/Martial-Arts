00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:50,110

something I

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,120

 

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,430

so you you have to spiral rotate the

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
so you you have to spiral rotate the
 

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,510
so you you have to spiral rotate the
fight and the spiral rotation is in

8
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,520
fight and the spiral rotation is in
 

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,029
fight and the spiral rotation is in
kiasa so it's in IIT okay don't blow

10
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
kiasa so it's in IIT okay don't blow
 

11
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,750
kiasa so it's in IIT okay don't blow
things out of proportion it's not that

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
things out of proportion it's not that
 

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,429
things out of proportion it's not that
I'm going to fight with Kona or II Tyson

14
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:06,439
I'm going to fight with Kona or II Tyson
 

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,230
I'm going to fight with Kona or II Tyson
but I can work on the

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
but I can work on the
 

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,670
but I can work on the
concepts of how do I spiral rotate the

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
concepts of how do I spiral rotate the
 

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,469
concepts of how do I spiral rotate the
fight which is another way of saying how

20
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
fight which is another way of saying how
 

21
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,510
fight which is another way of saying how
do I bring the opponent into the spiral

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
do I bring the opponent into the spiral
 

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,109
do I bring the opponent into the spiral
rotation you see that well I can force

24
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
rotation you see that well I can force
 

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,590
rotation you see that well I can force
them into it but that's not

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
them into it but that's not
 

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,630
them into it but that's not
Jiu-Jitsu or I can non-contest you into

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
Jiu-Jitsu or I can non-contest you into
 

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,149
Jiu-Jitsu or I can non-contest you into
it okay so we know he's going to grit

30
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
it okay so we know he's going to grit
 

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,230
it okay so we know he's going to grit
and already have a contestation okay

32
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,240
and already have a contestation okay
 

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,149
and already have a contestation okay
let's make that a ski that's not going

34
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
let's make that a ski that's not going
 

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,389
let's make that a ski that's not going
to be

36
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,399
to be
 

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,670
to be
right so when he skis I move out of the

38
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:42,680
right so when he skis I move out of the
 

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,630
right so when he skis I move out of the
way this way you see so I'm in this

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
way this way you see so I'm in this
 

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,069
way this way you see so I'm in this
stance and I take the back foot and I

42
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
stance and I take the back foot and I
 

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,069
stance and I take the back foot and I
move it off to this angle and that takes

44
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
move it off to this angle and that takes
 

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,149
move it off to this angle and that takes
the Target that he's trying to hit and

46
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:55,159
the Target that he's trying to hit and
 

47
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,950
the Target that he's trying to hit and
stay there and I move it and it's out of

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
stay there and I move it and it's out of
 

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,830
stay there and I move it and it's out of
the

50
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
the
 

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,749
the
way does that make sense okay so I'm not

52
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:02,759
way does that make sense okay so I'm not
 

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,630
way does that make sense okay so I'm not
going over

54
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
going over
 

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,990
going over
here I'm not staying on the

56
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000
here I'm not staying on the
 

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,430
here I'm not staying on the
line I rotate

58
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440

 

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,710

me I don't contest I move the

60
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
me I don't contest I move the
 

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,030
me I don't contest I move the
target okay and now I'm over here I'm

62
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,040
target okay and now I'm over here I'm
 

63
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,430
target okay and now I'm over here I'm
over here to him for him to continue to

64
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
over here to him for him to continue to
 

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,990
over here to him for him to continue to
assault he has to turn towards me do you

66
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
assault he has to turn towards me do you
 

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,550
assault he has to turn towards me do you
see

68
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
see
 

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,110
see
and that is where you

70
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120

 

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:45,470

get the final

72
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,480

 

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,550

rotation rotation I moved me in a way

74
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
rotation rotation I moved me in a way
 

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,110
rotation rotation I moved me in a way
that for him to continue the assault he

76
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,120
that for him to continue the assault he
 

77
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,309
that for him to continue the assault he
puts himself into this spir rotation

78
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
puts himself into this spir rotation
 

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,589
puts himself into this spir rotation
make sense okay so here we are at

80
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
make sense okay so here we are at
 

81
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,350
make sense okay so here we are at
io on and this

82
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
io on and this
 

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,710
io on and this
grip is kind of a

84
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:05,720
grip is kind of a
 

85
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,390
grip is kind of a
tactile training tool for everything

86
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:09,400
tactile training tool for everything
 

87
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,550
tactile training tool for everything
that I just did in terms of the overall

88
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
that I just did in terms of the overall
 

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,309
that I just did in terms of the overall
mine what's everything I did I cleared

90
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,319
mine what's everything I did I cleared
 

91
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,990
mine what's everything I did I cleared
the line I did it at an angle where he

92
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,000
the line I did it at an angle where he
 

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,390
the line I did it at an angle where he
would have to spiral rotate

94
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,400
would have to spiral rotate
 

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,270
would have to spiral rotate
himself and he would have to spiral

96
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
himself and he would have to spiral
 

97
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,710
himself and he would have to spiral
rotate himself in a way that I could

98
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:27,720
rotate himself in a way that I could
 

99
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,670
rotate himself in a way that I could
move with EDI and he would be in the

100
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
move with EDI and he would be in the
 

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,470
move with EDI and he would be in the
centrifugal energy of the SP rotation do

102
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
centrifugal energy of the SP rotation do
 

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
centrifugal energy of the SP rotation do
do you get it okay so that's all

104
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
do you get it okay so that's all
 

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,070
do you get it okay so that's all
happening at this

106
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
happening at this
 

107
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,710
happening at this
point so as he comes in I've already

108
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,720
point so as he comes in I've already
 

109
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,630
point so as he comes in I've already
moved we're not we're not

110
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
moved we're not we're not
 

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,429
moved we're not we're not
doing this

112
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:49,439
doing this
 

113
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,350
doing this
stuff I am not trying to move

114
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
stuff I am not trying to move
 

115
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,509
stuff I am not trying to move
him this one I moov me

116
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:00,519

 

117
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,069

so when I move me and then I

118
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,079
so when I move me and then I
 

119
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,270
so when I move me and then I
enter there's the enter so I

120
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
enter there's the enter so I
 

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,869
enter there's the enter so I
move

122
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
move
 

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,550
move
me then I

124
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
me then I
 

125
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,189
me then I
enter I move

126
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
enter I move
 

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,070
enter I move
me the adhesion kicks

128
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080

 

129
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,830

in and I

130
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
in and I
 

131
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,590
in and I
iner this is a long

132
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
iner this is a long
 

133
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,029
iner this is a long
way from

134
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:33,039
way from
 

135
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,790
way from
this okay but it is also different from

136
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
this okay but it is also different from
 

137
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,710
this okay but it is also different from
the stepping stone I had you

138
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:41,720

 

139
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,110

do from

140
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,120

 

141
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:54,950

that there it is then

142
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960

 

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,150

I okay

144
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
I okay
 

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,430
I okay
TR I don't want go to the 9 I don't want

146
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
TR I don't want go to the 9 I don't want
 

147
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,230
TR I don't want go to the 9 I don't want
to go over here to

148
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
to go over here to
 

149
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,029
to go over here to
3:00 there too much of a

150
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
3:00 there too much of a
 

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,710
3:00 there too much of a
flank so if we

152
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
flank so if we
 

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,749
flank so if we
were let's say we're spying okay pick

154
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
were let's say we're spying okay pick
 

155
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,150
were let's say we're spying okay pick
whatever side you want forward and then

156
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
whatever side you want forward and then
 

157
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,670
whatever side you want forward and then
he gets to the 90 somehow I'm going to

158
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
he gets to the 90 somehow I'm going to
 

159
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,590
he gets to the 90 somehow I'm going to
I'm attack he gets to the 90 okay you

160
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm attack he gets to the 90 okay you
 

161
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,469
I'm attack he gets to the 90 okay you
see that I'm not going to face him it's

162
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:27,479
see that I'm not going to face him it's
 

163
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,510
see that I'm not going to face him it's
too long you're going to come out

164
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,520
too long you're going to come out
 

165
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,909
too long you're going to come out
it's no different than if you feel your

166
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
it's no different than if you feel your
 

167
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,550
it's no different than if you feel your
back being taken in

168
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:35,560
back being taken in
 

169

head and then I go spiral
 

405
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,069
head and then I go spiral
rotate as he's going I'm already moving

406
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
rotate as he's going I'm already moving
 

407
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,509

off that line here I am at that same

408
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:36,519
off that line here I am at that same
 

409
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,350
off that line here I am at that same
angle okay the grip is the same my arm

410
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
angle okay the grip is the same my arm
 

411
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,750
angle okay the grip is the same my arm
is

412
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,760
is
 

413
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,629
is
not here anymore it is slightly here

414
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:47,639
not here anymore it is slightly here
 

415
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,189
not here anymore it is slightly here
which means his hand is slightly here

416
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:51,199
which means his hand is slightly here
 

417
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,870
which means his hand is slightly here
this direction so pay attention you

see other way
it's going that way so if I stay here I

422
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:04,600
it's going that way so if I stay here I

ever so
 

439
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,670
ever so
slightly it's not

440
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680

 

441
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,829

this just like punch this isn't it he's

442
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
this just like punch this isn't it he's
 

443
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,310
this just like punch this isn't it he's
punching right at the last second I move

444
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
punching right at the last second I move
 

445
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,389
punching right at the last second I move
right at the last second right

446
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399

 

447
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,189

here I'm not leading you and you follow

448

here I'm not leading you and you follow
 

449
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,430
here I'm not leading you and you follow
it and he's going to get

450
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
it and he's going to get
 

451
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,629
it and he's going to get
that inside his grip I'm timing it so

452
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:01,639
that inside his grip I'm timing it so
 

453
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,670
that inside his grip I'm timing it so
that it never goes that way does that

454
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
that it never goes that way does that
 

455
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,550
that it never goes that way does that
make sense yes okay

456
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
make sense yes okay
 

457
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,790
make sense yes okay
then let's say we're here we'll slow

458
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:09,800
then let's say we're here we'll slow
 

459
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,590
then let's say we're here we'll slow
down when I do this I don't want to take

460
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:14,600
down when I do this I don't want to take
 

461
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,269
down when I do this I don't want to take
what I created and

462
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
what I created and
 

463
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,430
what I created and
uncreated so his hand is not here his

464
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
uncreated so his hand is not here his
 

465
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,069
uncreated so his hand is not here his
hand was here about there and I was here

466
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
hand was here about there and I was here
 

467
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,590
hand was here about there and I was here
so when I do say when I do my

468
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
so when I do say when I do my
 

469
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,069

that
distance okay so uh shifting which way

474
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:42,279
