00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
charge me you get it you want to smother
 

173
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,670
charge me you get it you want to smother
the stick

174
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
the stick
 

175
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,270
the stick
that's what i want to learn what to deal

176
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
that's what i want to learn what to deal
 

177
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,189
that's what i want to learn what to deal
with okay if you're going to stay out

178
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
with okay if you're going to stay out
 

179
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,909
with okay if you're going to stay out
there

180
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
there
 

181
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,110
there
right boom i'll just come in and beat

182
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
right boom i'll just come in and beat
 

183
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,230
right boom i'll just come in and beat
the out of you but you want to

184
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
the out of you but you want to
 

185
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,510
the out of you but you want to
smother the weapon

186
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
smother the weapon
 

187
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,990
smother the weapon
okay but i don't want you to freak out

188
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
okay but i don't want you to freak out
 

189
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,430
okay but i don't want you to freak out
so he goes

190
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
so he goes
 

191
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,350
so he goes
boom and he smothers the weapons mother

192
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
boom and he smothers the weapons mother
 

193
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:58,070
boom and he smothers the weapons mother
of the weapon got it

194
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080

 

195
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,670

so i'm gonna find the outside

196
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
so i'm gonna find the outside
 

197
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,350
so i'm gonna find the outside
that's gonna be my strategy

198
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
that's gonna be my strategy
 

199
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,230
that's gonna be my strategy
so boom smothers the weapon i find the

200
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
so boom smothers the weapon i find the
 

201
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,110
so boom smothers the weapon i find the
outside you see

202
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
outside you see
 

203
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,830
outside you see
and then i move into the into the spiral

204
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
and then i move into the into the spiral
 

205
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,110
and then i move into the into the spiral
geometry

206
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
geometry
 

207
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:30,950

boom and

208
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960

 

209
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,990

i find this and then

210
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
i find this and then
 

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,710
i find this and then
move further into this final geometry he

212
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
move further into this final geometry he
 

213
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,710
move further into this final geometry he
goes

214
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
goes
 

215
00:06:38,720 --> 00:07:00,830
goes
hop here

216
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

217
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:14,830

oh

218
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

219
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:25,670

so

220
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680

 

221
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:35,909

push push push

222
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919

 

223
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,110

now if he already drives a little

224
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
now if he already drives a little
 

225
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,950
now if he already drives a little
then you can do a fade

226
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960

 

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,230

he drives a little i can do a fade

228
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
he drives a little i can do a fade
 

229
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,070
he drives a little i can do a fade
if he drives a lot boom i gotta turn

230
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080

 

231
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,070

and i would like you to drive a lot

232
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
and i would like you to drive a lot
 

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,230
and i would like you to drive a lot
because the fade doesn't work

234
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
because the fade doesn't work
 

235
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,350
because the fade doesn't work
so his strategy is very common it would

236
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
so his strategy is very common it would
 

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,309
so his strategy is very common it would
be the same one

238
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
be the same one
 

239
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,309
be the same one
for out here and he's pepper and me

240
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
for out here and he's pepper and me
 

241
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,550
for out here and he's pepper and me
peppery peppermint i would come in

242
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
peppery peppermint i would come in
 

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,270
peppery peppermint i would come in
and close the gap where i'm inside the

244
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
and close the gap where i'm inside the
 

245
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,550
and close the gap where i'm inside the
eye of the storm of his stripes

246
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
eye of the storm of his stripes
 

247
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,670
eye of the storm of his stripes
so i have the weapon

248
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
so i have the weapon
 

249
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
so i have the weapon
and he does not want to stay in my

250
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
and he does not want to stay in my
 

251
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,029
and he does not want to stay in my
weapon range

252

253
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,070

he has two choices he can be outside the

254
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
he has two choices he can be outside the
 

255
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,070
he has two choices he can be outside the
range of the hurricane

256
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
range of the hurricane
 

257
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,469
range of the hurricane
or he can be in the eye of the storm so

258
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
or he can be in the eye of the storm so
 

259
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,390
or he can be in the eye of the storm so
he had forward progress

260
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
he had forward progress
 

261
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,309
he had forward progress
right both and he's trying to smother

262
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
right both and he's trying to smother
 

263
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,629
right both and he's trying to smother
the weapon start trying to stop me from

264
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
the weapon start trying to stop me from
 

265
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,790
the weapon start trying to stop me from
using it again

266
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
using it again
 

267
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,469
using it again
otherwise i'm going to hit him again so

268
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
otherwise i'm going to hit him again so
 

269
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,389
otherwise i'm going to hit him again so
i'm just working on my transition

270
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399

 

271
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,430

when we go slow what i'm out

272
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
when we go slow what i'm out
 

273
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,670
when we go slow what i'm out
i'm at weapon range and i keep the

274
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
i'm at weapon range and i keep the
 

275
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,949
i'm at weapon range and i keep the
strategy going

276
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
strategy going
 

277
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,230
strategy going
so he's really pressing on me go back

278
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
so he's really pressing on me go back
 

279
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,710
so he's really pressing on me go back
so this is going to be a turn he goes

280
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
so this is going to be a turn he goes
 

281
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,350
so this is going to be a turn he goes
and

282
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360

 

283
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,430

if he only presses a little which isn't

284
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
if he only presses a little which isn't
 

285
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,670
if he only presses a little which isn't
a very good strategy on him like

286
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680

 

287
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,110

so we'll find the outside don't come on

288
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
so we'll find the outside don't come on
 

289

the inside
 

291
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:32,060

find the outside yield boom

i go boom he goes and

326
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
i go boom he goes and
 

327
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,310
i go boom he goes and
then i don't really have to do nikki and

328
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
then i don't really have to do nikki and
 

329
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,050
