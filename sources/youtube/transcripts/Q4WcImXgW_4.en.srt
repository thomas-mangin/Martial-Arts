go up push down on me you see
 

53
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,789
go up push down on me you see
so i have to figure that out i can't

54
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
so i have to figure that out i can't
 

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,789
so i have to figure that out i can't
have

56
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:45,799
have
 

57
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,190
have
extension which is the size

58
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
extension which is the size
 

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,510
extension which is the size
tension do you get it so i'm super soft

60
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
tension do you get it so i'm super soft
 

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,109
tension do you get it so i'm super soft
boom but there's an integrity to the

62
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
boom but there's an integrity to the
 

63
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,990
boom but there's an integrity to the
motion

64
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
motion
 

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,310
motion
okay now let's try it again and i'm

66
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
okay now let's try it again and i'm
 

67
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,270
okay now let's try it again and i'm
looking

68
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
looking
 

69
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,789
looking
for gaps and

70
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
for gaps and
 

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,710
for gaps and
too much friction okay

72
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
too much friction okay
 

73
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,229
too much friction okay
if you're not sure what too much

74
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
if you're not sure what too much
 

75
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,390
if you're not sure what too much
friction is it's where you have to keep

76
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
friction is it's where you have to keep
 

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,710
friction is it's where you have to keep
adjusting you have to keep adjusting

78
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
adjusting you have to keep adjusting
 

79
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,070
adjusting you have to keep adjusting
because you got stopped

80
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
because you got stopped
 

81
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,750
because you got stopped
you see and then you got to let it go

82
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
you see and then you got to let it go
 

83
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,309
you see and then you got to let it go

so it's basically like i'm going to draw

130
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
so it's basically like i'm going to draw
 

131
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,509
so it's basically like i'm going to draw
right

00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
right
 

133
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,229
right
and i'm going to pass the line aside and

134
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
and i'm going to pass the line aside and
 

135
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:36,710
and i'm going to pass the line aside and
i

136
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
i
 

137
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,509
i
fish right or i'm going to pass the

138
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
fish right or i'm going to pass the
 

139
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,309
fish right or i'm going to pass the
holster

140
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
holster
 

141
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,869
holster
i draw and i come down below the holster

142
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
i draw and i come down below the holster
 

143
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,990
i draw and i come down below the holster
and i'm pulling

144
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
and i'm pulling
 

145
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,509
and i'm pulling
that that's what you're doing here so

146
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
that that's what you're doing here so
 

147
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,670
that that's what you're doing here so
instead of this hand coming over here

148
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
instead of this hand coming over here
 

149
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,910
instead of this hand coming over here
you're going like this okay

150
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
you're going like this okay
 

151
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,869
you're going like this okay
so you have to work on that extension is

152
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
so you have to work on that extension is
 

153
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,670
so you have to work on that extension is
not we don't

154
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
not we don't
 

155
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,949
not we don't
have we don't have extension we don't

156
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
have we don't have extension we don't
 

157
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,270
have we don't have extension we don't
use

158
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
use
 

159
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,070
use
extension in this jojo okay we have

160
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
extension in this jojo okay we have
 

161
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,949
extension in this jojo okay we have
integrity

162
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
integrity
 

163
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,509
integrity
we have organization it's different

164
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
we have organization it's different
 

165
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,710
we have organization it's different
extension

166
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
extension
 

167
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,509
extension
is tension okay so we come a little

168
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
is tension okay so we come a little
 

169
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,789
is tension okay so we come a little
closer

170
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
closer
 

171
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,670
closer

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
going to yield
 

321
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,270
going to yield
you see i'm going to not be there

322
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
you see i'm going to not be there
 

323

but i'm not getting out of the way and
 

325
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,390
but i'm not getting out of the way and
pushing it down

326
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
pushing it down
 

327
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,510
pushing it down
i'm sticking to it you think you're

328
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
i'm sticking to it you think you're
 

329

335
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,430

so find the pattern of the inward spiral

336
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
so find the pattern of the inward spiral
 

337
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,510
so find the pattern of the inward spiral
boom okay try it again

338
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520

 

339
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,790
