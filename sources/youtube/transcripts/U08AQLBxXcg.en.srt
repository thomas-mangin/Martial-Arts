00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
all right so I'm going to rephrase your
 

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,470
all right so I'm going to rephrase your
question and and just answer how do you

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
question and and just answer how do you

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,830
question and and just answer how do you
do a

minds
 

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,869
minds
through a yashi we're going to take that

20
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:33,879
through a yashi we're going to take that
 

21
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:34,830
through a yashi we're going to take that
off the

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:34,840
off the

00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:47,079
UK and then in order to do that I must
 

31
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,229
UK and then in order to do that I must
be able to let Yang energy enter my body

32
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
be able to let Yang energy enter my body
 

33
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,150
be able to let Yang energy enter my body
without displacing me which means there

34
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,160
without displacing me which means there
 

35
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,310
without displacing me which means there
must be some Integrity to where I am in

36
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
must be some Integrity to where I am in
 

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,630

space okay

38
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640

00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
we're going to take that off the
 

41
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,630
we're going to take that off the
table and we're going to look at the

42
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
table and we're going to look at the
 

43
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,190
table and we're going to look at the
physical component the physical

44
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
physical component the physical
 

45
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,350
physical component the physical
component is going to set me up for the

46
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,360
component is going to set me up for the
 

47
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,830
component is going to set me up for the
latter two components okay but we can

48
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:14,840
latter two components okay but we can
 

49
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,270
latter two components okay but we can
use uh what you might want to understand

50
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,280
use uh what you might want to understand
 

51
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,069
use uh what you might want to understand
as

52
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,079
as
 

53
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,230
as
biomechanics and we could maybe use that

54
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
biomechanics and we could maybe use that
 

55
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,230
biomechanics and we could maybe use that
to get in the doorway to understand

56
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,240
to get in the doorway to understand
 

57
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,990
to get in the doorway to understand
where and how my body has to be

58
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,000
where and how my body has to be
 

59
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,749
where and how my body has to be
organized for energetic reconciliation

60
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:30,759
organized for energetic reconciliation
 

61
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,870
organized for energetic reconciliation
okay uh and that's what we're going to

62
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
okay uh and that's what we're going to
 

63
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,950
okay uh and that's what we're going to
do now okay so we'll we'll measure our

64
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
do now okay so we'll we'll measure our
 

65
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,590
do now okay so we'll we'll measure our
integrity of our organization by our

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,600
integrity of our organization by our
 

67
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,590
integrity of our organization by our
ability to displace resistance

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
ability to displace resistance
 

69
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,550
ability to displace resistance
resistance is Young energy okay in this

00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
energy or not okay if I get displaced by
 

79
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,870

81
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,350
y energy or if I cannot displace yangong
energy there's no way I'll be able to

internalize Yang energy
 

85
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,830
internalize Yang energy
okay so uh let you can put your joke

86
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:10,840
okay so uh let you can put your joke
 

87
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,229
okay so uh let you can put your joke
down let's get some basic concepts okay

down let's get some basic concepts okay
 

89
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,790
down let's get some basic concepts okay
first let's take kinesiological Concepts

first let's take kinesiological Concepts
 

91
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,430
first let's take kinesiological Concepts
regarding our basis support so we have

92
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
regarding our basis support so we have
 

93
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,710
regarding our basis support so we have
our center of gravity that's that

uh the rest of my form is balanced
 

99
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,390
uh the rest of my form is balanced
balancing itself we have a line of

100
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
balancing itself we have a line of
 

101
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,150
balancing itself we have a line of

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,470
my line of Gravity Falls outside my Bas
of support such as when I lean forward

138
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
of support such as when I lean forward
 

139
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,030
of support such as when I lean forward
my Center gravity is going up my body

140
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
my Center gravity is going up my body
 

141
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,110
my Center gravity is going up my body
but that line of gravity is moving out

142
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
but that line of gravity is moving out
 

143
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,030
but that line of gravity is moving out
because it remains perpendicular from

144
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
because it remains perpendicular from
 

145
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,149
because it remains perpendicular from
the center of gravity and eventually it

146
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
the center of gravity and eventually it
 

147
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,710
the center of gravity and eventually it
falls out outside my basis support and I

148
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720
falls out outside my basis support and I
 

149
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,270
falls out outside my basis support and I
will eventually lose my balance okay so

150
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,280
will eventually lose my balance okay so
 

151
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,910
will eventually lose my balance okay so
those are the three things we want to

152
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
those are the three things we want to
 

153
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,550
those are the three things we want to
understand initially Center gravity line

Yang energy and this case resistance and
 

161
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,990
Yang energy and this case resistance and
not being displaced by it I have to

162
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
not being displaced by it I have to
 

163
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,229
not being displaced by it I have to
understand where I have energy leakage

164
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:55,239
understand where I have energy leakage
 

165
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,630
understand where I have energy leakage
in my

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,670
in my
yashi and I will always have energy leak

168
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
yashi and I will always have energy leak
 

169
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,750
yashi and I will always have energy leak
leage whenever my line of Gravity Falls

170
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:02,760
leage whenever my line of Gravity Falls
 

171
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,990
leage whenever my line of Gravity Falls
outside my Bas of support okay um but

172
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
outside my Bas of support okay um but
 

173
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,390
outside my Bas of support okay um but
there's a

174
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
there's a
 

175
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,710
there's a
catch I'll also have energy

176
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
catch I'll also have energy
 

177
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,229
catch I'll also have energy
leakage when that when I don't get a

178
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
leakage when that when I don't get a
 

179
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,390
leakage when that when I don't get a
single when I don't unify my contact

180
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,400
single when I don't unify my contact
 

181
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,030
single when I don't unify my contact
point with the Earth and my basis

182
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
point with the Earth and my basis
 

183
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,030
point with the Earth and my basis
support when I have my line of gravity

184
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
support when I have my line of gravity
 

185
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,070
support when I have my line of gravity
between my feet such that it's between

186
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,080
between my feet such that it's between
 

187
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,909
between my feet such that it's between
my cont points but it is within my Bas

188
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
my cont points but it is within my Bas
 

189
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,629
my cont points but it is within my Bas
of support you're going to lose power

190
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
of support you're going to lose power
 

191
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,590
of support you're going to lose power
okay so we're going to have you run a

192
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:36,600
okay so we're going to have you run a
 

193
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,950
okay so we're going to have you run a
couple experiments on that okay uh so a

194
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
couple experiments on that okay uh so a
 

195
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,150
couple experiments on that okay uh so a
yashi here is a resistance he can push

196
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
yashi here is a resistance he can push
 

197
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,590
yashi here is a resistance he can push
on it okay and I want you to put your

198
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
on it okay and I want you to put your
 

199
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,390
on it okay and I want you to put your
line of gravity in the middle of your

200
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,400
line of gravity in the middle of your
 

201
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,350
line of gravity in the middle of your
two contact points in the middle of your

202
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
two contact points in the middle of your
 

203
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,749
two contact points in the middle of your
two feet leaving the line of gravity in

204
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
two feet leaving the line of gravity in
 

205
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,590
two feet leaving the line of gravity in
the middle of your two feet I want you

206
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
the middle of your two feet I want you
 

207
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,629
the middle of your two feet I want you
you to try to displace him walking

208
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
you to try to displace him walking
 

209
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,990
you to try to displace him walking
forward you can give a little energy

210
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
forward you can give a little energy
 

211
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,150
forward you can give a little energy
okay what you're going to see is as soon

212
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,160
okay what you're going to see is as soon
 

213
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,189
okay what you're going to see is as soon
as you take that foot off the

214
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,199
as you take that foot off the
 

215
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,950
as you take that foot off the
ground you this foot is useless and you

216
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:13,960
ground you this foot is useless and you
 

217
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,469
ground you this foot is useless and you
will not be able to go forward on him he

218
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:17,479
will not be able to go forward on him he
 

219
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,830
will not be able to go forward on him he
will push you off

220
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
will push you off
 

221
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,390
will push you off
okay so that's your first little

222
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
okay so that's your first little
 

223
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,550
okay so that's your first little
experiment run it put your line of

224
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
experiment run it put your line of
 

225
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,990
experiment run it put your line of
gravity between your feet and try to

226
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
gravity between your feet and try to
 

227
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,670
gravity between your feet and try to
move keeping it there you and he has

228
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
move keeping it there you and he has
 

229
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,150
move keeping it there you and he has
great enough resistance it's going to

230
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,160
great enough resistance it's going to
 

231
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,189
great enough resistance it's going to
displace me okay the other one I want

232
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
displace me okay the other one I want
 

233
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,550
displace me okay the other one I want
you to do is he'll let me get that step

234
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
you to do is he'll let me get that step
 

235
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,870
you to do is he'll let me get that step
I don't care where you put your line of

236
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:39,880
I don't care where you put your line of
 

237
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,070
I don't care where you put your line of
gravity now but you're going to get that

238
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
gravity now but you're going to get that
 

239
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,430
gravity now but you're going to get that
step he's going to resist really hard

240
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,440
step he's going to resist really hard
 

241
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,830
step he's going to resist really hard
right there and I'm going to Rudder that

242
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:46,840
right there and I'm going to Rudder that
 

243
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,350
right there and I'm going to Rudder that
foot Rudder is when my back foot moves

244
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,360
foot Rudder is when my back foot moves
 

245
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,629
foot Rudder is when my back foot moves
up the circle okay I'll do it again

246
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
up the circle okay I'll do it again
 

247
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,029
up the circle okay I'll do it again
you'll let me get that step you'll give

248
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
you'll let me get that step you'll give
 

249
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,590
you'll let me get that step you'll give
great resistance here and you're you're

250
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
great resistance here and you're you're
 

251
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,629
great resistance here and you're you're
going to see that I'm bouncing off of

252
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:01,639
going to see that I'm bouncing off of
 

253
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,469
going to see that I'm bouncing off of
him because energy is coming out of that

254
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
him because energy is coming out of that
 

255
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,070
him because energy is coming out of that
ruding foot why because my line of

256
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
ruding foot why because my line of
 

257
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,309
ruding foot why because my line of
gravity is back in between those two

258
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
gravity is back in between those two
 

259
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,589
gravity is back in between those two
feet as I rotated okay so again our two

260
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:14,599
feet as I rotated okay so again our two
 

261
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,950
feet as I rotated okay so again our two
experiments here great resistance try to

262
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:17,960
experiments here great resistance try to
 

263
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,070
experiments here great resistance try to
go forward great you I got it give me

264
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
go forward great you I got it give me
 

265
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,830
go forward great you I got it give me
greater

266
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:24,840

 

267
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,550

man okay and then the next one he'll let

268
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,560
man okay and then the next one he'll let
 

269
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,629
man okay and then the next one he'll let
me take that step then hard when I get

270
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
me take that step then hard when I get
 

271
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,070
me take that step then hard when I get
through step hard and R and you'll see

272
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
through step hard and R and you'll see
 

273
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,950
through step hard and R and you'll see
you're bouncing off the H okay let's

274
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
you're bouncing off the H okay let's
 

275
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,749
you're bouncing off the H okay let's
just experience these two energy

276
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
just experience these two energy
 

277
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,830
just experience these two energy
leakages okay go so I'm I'm going to

278
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
leakages okay go so I'm I'm going to
 

279
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,469
leakages okay go so I'm I'm going to
demonstrate it because he didn't quite

280
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
demonstrate it because he didn't quite
 

281
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,230
demonstrate it because he didn't quite
give give me the the resistance that I

282
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,240
give give me the the resistance that I
 

283
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,950
give give me the the resistance that I
wanted so he he's going to try to walk

284
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:49,960
wanted so he he's going to try to walk
 

285
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,909
wanted so he he's going to try to walk
forward go he's he's never going to do

286
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:52,919
forward go he's he's never going to do
 

287
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,710
forward go he's he's never going to do
it try it again he's never going to do

288
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
it try it again he's never going to do
 

289
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,510
it try it again he's never going to do
it that's actually where you do stop

290
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
it that's actually where you do stop
 

291
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,430
it that's actually where you do stop
hits you know so where you take you get

292
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,440
hits you know so where you take you get
 

293
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,189
hits you know so where you take you get
kazushi with stop hits It's the guy's in

294
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
kazushi with stop hits It's the guy's in
 

295
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,589
kazushi with stop hits It's the guy's in
mid stride but he has to be walking that

296
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:08,599
mid stride but he has to be walking that
 

297
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,830
mid stride but he has to be walking that
way okay so for example He he'll take

298
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:12,840
way okay so for example He he'll take
 

299
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,430
way okay so for example He he'll take
that step towards me just a step like

300
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
that step towards me just a step like
 

301
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,110
that step towards me just a step like
step we're working on a yashi okay so he

302
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,120
step we're working on a yashi okay so he
 

303
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,270
step we're working on a yashi okay so he
takes the step and in the step I pop him

304
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
takes the step and in the step I pop him
 

305
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,950
takes the step and in the step I pop him
he's going to go off balance or as he's

306
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:23,960
he's going to go off balance or as he's
 

307
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,670
he's going to go off balance or as he's
walking towards me boom I kick on that

308
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
walking towards me boom I kick on that
 

309
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,469
walking towards me boom I kick on that
step you can see his line of gravity is

310
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
step you can see his line of gravity is
 

311
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,749
step you can see his line of gravity is
between so your always look for that uh

312
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
between so your always look for that uh
 

313
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,629
between so your always look for that uh
and you're doing your like he's over

314
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:33,639
and you're doing your like he's over
 

315
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,350
and you're doing your like he's over
here and he's lipping off or whatever

316
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
here and he's lipping off or whatever
 

317
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,110
here and he's lipping off or whatever
and then I see him when you pop him in

318
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
and then I see him when you pop him in
 

319
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,270
and then I see him when you pop him in
the throat you get way more displacement

320
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,280
the throat you get way more displacement
 

321
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,350
the throat you get way more displacement
than the little strike actually

322
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,360
than the little strike actually
 

323
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,309
than the little strike actually
generates but it's because of the way

324
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
generates but it's because of the way
 

325
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,830
generates but it's because of the way
the line of gravity was in the middle of

326
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:48,840
the line of gravity was in the middle of
 

327
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,830
the line of gravity was in the middle of
his two contact points okay and he's

328
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,840
his two contact points okay and he's
 

329
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,390
his two contact points okay and he's
trying to go

330
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
trying to go
 

331
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,589
trying to go
forward um on the second one I'll give

332
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
forward um on the second one I'll give
 

333
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,589
forward um on the second one I'll give
him the first and yumii but you have to

334
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
him the first and yumii but you have to
 

335
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,189
him the first and yumii but you have to
rud her the back foot okay there's the

336
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:00,199
rud her the back foot okay there's the
 

337
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,830
rud her the back foot okay there's the
first one and you see the Joe goes that

338
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:02,840
first one and you see the Joe goes that
 

339
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,550
first one and you see the Joe goes that
way at the end okay again it's not

340
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,560
way at the end okay again it's not
 

341
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,270
way at the end okay again it's not
merely a matter of the back foot of the

342
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
merely a matter of the back foot of the
 

343
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,629
merely a matter of the back foot of the
line of gravity being between the two

344
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:13,639
line of gravity being between the two
 

345
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,550
line of gravity being between the two
contact points it is but he's also

346
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
contact points it is but he's also
 

347
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,469
contact points it is but he's also
losing degree of penetration so if you

348
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:19,479
losing degree of penetration so if you
 

349
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,510
losing degree of penetration so if you
make a fist you see and as he moves that

350
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:24,520
make a fist you see and as he moves that
 

351
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,189
make a fist you see and as he moves that
back foot up the circle you'll see that

352
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
back foot up the circle you'll see that
 

353
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,950
back foot up the circle you'll see that
he's actually losing penetration and we

354
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
he's actually losing penetration and we
 

355
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,149
he's actually losing penetration and we
use that all the time when we want to go

356
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
use that all the time when we want to go
 

357
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,350
use that all the time when we want to go
to the zon of sanctuary and get out of

358
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
to the zon of sanctuary and get out of
 

359
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,870
to the zon of sanctuary and get out of
the way of his weapon so if my weapon is

360
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
the way of his weapon so if my weapon is
 

361
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,790
the way of his weapon so if my weapon is
hitting him here if he now moves that

362
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:43,800
hitting him here if he now moves that
 

363
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,990
hitting him here if he now moves that
way he's got range between us you see

364
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
way he's got range between us you see
 

365
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,190
way he's got range between us you see
okay so uh we don't want to Rudder

366
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,200
okay so uh we don't want to Rudder
 

367
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,630
okay so uh we don't want to Rudder
that's what I call it when your foot

368
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:51,640
that's what I call it when your foot
 

369
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,230
that's what I call it when your foot
moves around we never want to Rudder is

370
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
moves around we never want to Rudder is
 

371
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,470
moves around we never want to Rudder is
very common in iido but is very

372
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:57,480
very common in iido but is very
 

373
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,829
very common in iido but is very
incorrect um and we we don't want to

374
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:00,839
incorrect um and we we don't want to
 

375
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,269
incorrect um and we we don't want to
have our line of gravity between our two

376
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
have our line of gravity between our two
 

377
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,350
have our line of gravity between our two
contact points I for tonight are going

378
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
contact points I for tonight are going
 

379
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,150
contact points I for tonight are going
to call that double waiting we don't

380
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,160
to call that double waiting we don't
 

381
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,949
to call that double waiting we don't
want to double weight okay what we want

382
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:09,959
want to double weight okay what we want
 

383
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,509
want to double weight okay what we want
to do

384
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:12,519
to do
 

385
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,630
to do
instead is shift our line of gravity

386
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:15,640
instead is shift our line of gravity
 

387
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,790
instead is shift our line of gravity
from one contact

388
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:17,800
from one contact
 

389
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,150
from one contact
point to the other contact Point okay so

390
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
point to the other contact Point okay so
 

391
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,910
point to the other contact Point okay so
uh at the midfoot so I'm going to shift

392
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
uh at the midfoot so I'm going to shift
 

393
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,310
uh at the midfoot so I'm going to shift
my weight so that I'm on the midfoot and

394
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,320
my weight so that I'm on the midfoot and
 

395
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,470
my weight so that I'm on the midfoot and
I'm going to give you I'm on the Yang

396
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm going to give you I'm on the Yang
 

397
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,550
I'm going to give you I'm on the Yang
aspect of the midfoot the Yang aspect of

398
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,560
aspect of the midfoot the Yang aspect of
 

399
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,670
aspect of the midfoot the Yang aspect of
the midfoot so my front knee is going to

400
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,680
the midfoot so my front knee is going to
 

401
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,509
the midfoot so my front knee is going to
go all the way to my

402
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:40,519
go all the way to my
 

403
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,630
go all the way to my
toes okay so my my ankle is forward you

404
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
toes okay so my my ankle is forward you
 

405
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,110
toes okay so my my ankle is forward you
see but I'm not going to go past my toes

406
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
see but I'm not going to go past my toes
 

407
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,110
see but I'm not going to go past my toes
that's going to jack you up but my ankle

408
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,120
that's going to jack you up but my ankle
 

409
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,750
that's going to jack you up but my ankle
is not

410
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
is not
 

411
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,269
is not
straight I'm going to bring my knee to

412
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:54,279
straight I'm going to bring my knee to
 

413
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,430
straight I'm going to bring my knee to
my toe line this line

414
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
my toe line this line
 

415
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,990
my toe line this line
here this is too far you're going to

416
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
here this is too far you're going to
 

417
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,670
here this is too far you're going to
injure yourself and you will your line

418
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:02,680
injure yourself and you will your line
 

419
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,710
injure yourself and you will your line
of gravity is now forward of the midfoot

420
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:05,720
of gravity is now forward of the midfoot
 

421
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,509
of gravity is now forward of the midfoot
which is incorrect and inapplicable at

422
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:08,519
which is incorrect and inapplicable at
 

423
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,470
which is incorrect and inapplicable at
the energetic phase so I'm midfoot but

424
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
the energetic phase so I'm midfoot but
 

425
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,990
the energetic phase so I'm midfoot but
young midfoot

426
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
young midfoot
 

427
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,310
young midfoot
okay come this way he's giv me that same

428
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
okay come this way he's giv me that same
 

429
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,110
okay come this way he's giv me that same
resistance I'm going to

430
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
resistance I'm going to
 

431
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,350
resistance I'm going to
go young midfoot think of it knee to

432
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
go young midfoot think of it knee to
 

433
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,550
go young midfoot think of it knee to
toes and then all my weight is on this

434
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
toes and then all my weight is on this
 

435
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,870
toes and then all my weight is on this
foot so this there's no weight on this

436
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
foot so this there's no weight on this
 

437
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,269
foot so this there's no weight on this
foot which means my line of gravity is

438
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
foot which means my line of gravity is
 

439
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,629
foot which means my line of gravity is
not between my contact points it'll get

440
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:37,639
not between my contact points it'll get
 

441
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,550
not between my contact points it'll get
stuck midfoot y here there's no weight

442
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:41,560
stuck midfoot y here there's no weight
 

443
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,150
stuck midfoot y here there's no weight
but I can move forward using the mid

444
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,160
but I can move forward using the mid
 

445
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,550
but I can move forward using the mid
foot of the previous foot and I do the

446
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:47,560
foot of the previous foot and I do the
 

447
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,030
foot of the previous foot and I do the
same thing here knee to tow line and

448
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
same thing here knee to tow line and
 

449
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,509
same thing here knee to tow line and
then drive with that ground Vector

450
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519

 

451
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,069

forward I don't care how you step your

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
forward I don't care how you step your
 

453
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,190
forward I don't care how you step your
foot right now I'm exaggerating by

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,200
foot right now I'm exaggerating by
 

455
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,030
foot right now I'm exaggerating by
lifting the foot boom I have that

456
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
lifting the foot boom I have that
 

457
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,190
lifting the foot boom I have that
positive angle drive that midfoot Vector

465
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,430

moving okay let's try it

466
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,440
moving okay let's try it
 

467
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,509
moving okay let's try it
go okay so

468
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
go okay so
 

469
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,190
go okay so
you actually do this in your Kona if you

470
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,200
you actually do this in your Kona if you
 

471
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,829
you actually do this in your Kona if you
pay attention you're going to do what is

472
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:34,839
pay attention you're going to do what is
 

473
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,470
pay attention you're going to do what is
called half Moone so as I shift here

474
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,480
called half Moone so as I shift here
 

475
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,110
called half Moone so as I shift here
you're going to you're going to see that

476
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
you're going to you're going to see that
 

477
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,030
you're going to you're going to see that
as I bring all my weight to that single

478
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
as I bring all my weight to that single

gravity is not on this point so my feet

484
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:52,279
gravity is not on this point so my feet
 

485
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,389
gravity is not on this point so my feet
come

486
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:53,399
come
 

487
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,069
come
together push and then they'll go out so

488
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
together push and then they'll go out so

you are Happ half mooning feet together

490
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
you are Happ half mooning feet together
 

491
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,509
you are Happ half mooning feet together

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
okay so if I do
 

495
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,710
okay so if I do
uh EO for example I

496
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
uh EO for example I
 

497
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,949
uh EO for example I
help you're going to see that this leg

498
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:13,959
help you're going to see that this leg
 

499
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,910
help you're going to see that this leg
does not go there this leg is going to

500
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:16,920
does not go there this leg is going to
 

501
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,949
does not go there this leg is going to
pass by the other

502
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
pass by the other
 

503
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,350
pass by the other
foot you're half moving in into

504
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360

 

505
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,870

your

506
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
your
 

507
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,870
your
okay

508
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880

 

509
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,949

key though is that your line of gravity

510
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
key though is that your line of gravity
 

511
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,829
key though is that your line of gravity
is entirely on one contact point where

512
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
is entirely on one contact point where
 

513
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,269
is entirely on one contact point where
the midfoot of whatever ground you're

514
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
the midfoot of whatever ground you're
 

515
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,670
the midfoot of whatever ground you're
whatever foot you're using for the

516
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
whatever foot you're using for the

vectoring again we took the energetic

520
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:46,519
vectoring again we took the energetic
 

521
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,110
vectoring again we took the energetic
off the table because energetically it's

522
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,120
off the table because energetically it's
 

523
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,710
off the table because energetically it's
not necessary but to get you in the ball

524
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
not necessary but to get you in the ball
 

525
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,230
not necessary but to get you in the ball
part this is how to do it

526
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,240
part this is how to do it
 

527
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,990
part this is how to do it
okay all right let us

528
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,000

 

529
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,110

work not with a punch but with the Palm

530
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,120
work not with a punch but with the Palm
 

531
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,350
work not with a punch but with the Palm
heel so we don't break anything okay um

532
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
heel so we don't break anything okay um
 

533
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,350
heel so we don't break anything okay um
and I'm going to

534
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
and I'm going to
 

535
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,350
and I'm going to
do those

536
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
do those
 

537
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,590
do those
same

538
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
same

Dynamics but not
ring okay so I'm going to do a

542
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,040
ring okay so I'm going to do a
 

543
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,590
ring okay so I'm going to do a
yashi push and I would like for you to

544
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
yashi push and I would like for you to
 

545
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,189
yashi push and I would like for you to
try one

549
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,310

push and then

550
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,320
push and then
 

551
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,710
push and then
ruding okay let's try it go people that

Rudder always feel powerful in ruding

554
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,000
Rudder always feel powerful in ruding
 

555
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,870
Rudder always feel powerful in ruding
it's hard for them to realize that

556
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
it's hard for them to realize that
 

557
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,150
it's hard for them to realize that
you're losing power so uh we'll increase

558
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
you're losing power so uh we'll increase
 

559
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,069
you're losing power so uh we'll increase
the level of resistance so that you

560
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
the level of resistance so that you
 

561
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,430
the level of resistance so that you
could see it okay uh so come uh stand be

562
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:54,440
could see it okay uh so come uh stand be
 

563
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,910
could see it okay uh so come uh stand be
near his

564
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
near his
 

565
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,590
near his
back we just increase the mass

566
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
back we just increase the mass
 

567
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,030
back we just increase the mass
see okay and I'm not using my arm

568
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
see okay and I'm not using my arm
 

569
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,030
see okay and I'm not using my arm
strength my arm is more like a like the

R okay try it go okay uh so one of the
 

579
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,870
R okay try it go okay uh so one of the
de here pointed out this is a good point

580
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:31,880
de here pointed out this is a good point
 

581
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,829
de here pointed out this is a good point
so we'll make it for you okay so when

582
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:34,839
so we'll make it for you okay so when
 

583
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,030
so we'll make it for you okay so when
when you

584
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
when you
 

585
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,269
when you
Runner your line of gravity is between

your
 

589
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,790
your
feet which means it's not going to be on

590
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
feet which means it's not going to be on
 

591
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,110
feet which means it's not going to be on
the midfoot

592
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,120
the midfoot
 

593
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,870
the midfoot
vector we we did take the energetic

594
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
vector we we did take the energetic
 

595
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,310
vector we we did take the energetic
aspect off the table but we are doing it

596
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
aspect off the table but we are doing it
 

597
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,470
aspect off the table but we are doing it
consistently across both elements so uh

598
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
consistently across both elements so uh
 

599
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,910
consistently across both elements so uh
the force or the let's say the

600
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
the force or the let's say the
 

601
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,150
the force or the let's say the
anatomical structure that can displace

602
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
anatomical structure that can displace
 

603
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,550
anatomical structure that can displace
mass is also the same anatomical

604
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
mass is also the same anatomical
 

605
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,749
mass is also the same anatomical
structure that can internalize the Yang

606
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:09,759
structure that can internalize the Yang
 

607
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,470

energy okay so uh when I hit his Mass

608
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
energy okay so uh when I hit his Mass
 

609
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,870
energy okay so uh when I hit his Mass
there's an equal and opposite energy so

610
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
there's an equal and opposite energy so
 

611
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,910
there's an equal and opposite energy so
when I hit his Mass there's a y energy

612
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
when I hit his Mass there's a y energy
 

613
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,870
when I hit his Mass there's a y energy
that comes back

614
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:21,880
that comes back
 

615
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,350
that comes back
okay it happens very quickly but that y

616
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:26,360
okay it happens very quickly but that y
 

617
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,230
okay it happens very quickly but that y
energy gets internalized it hits

618
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,240
energy gets internalized it hits
 

619
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,350
energy gets internalized it hits
whatever midfoot I needed to hit in this

620
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
whatever midfoot I needed to hit in this
 

621
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,870
whatever midfoot I needed to hit in this
case it would be the back foot and it's

622
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:33,880
case it would be the back foot and it's
 

623
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,949
case it would be the back foot and it's
going to generate the tanden field I'm

624
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
going to generate the tanden field I'm
 

625
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,949
going to generate the tanden field I'm
going to be able to rotate the tonden

626
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
going to be able to rotate the tonden
 

627
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,470
going to be able to rotate the tonden
field and if necessary koku project him

628
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
field and if necessary koku project him
 

629
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,030
field and if necessary koku project him
off okay so it's not that I'm I'm in in

630
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
off okay so it's not that I'm I'm in in
 

631
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,870
off okay so it's not that I'm I'm in in

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,829
throwing matter at
him that's not what's what's happening

634
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
him that's not what's what's happening
 

635
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,509
him that's not what's what's happening
in in iido okay what's happening is that

636
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:56,519
in in iido okay what's happening is that
 

637
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,990
in in iido okay what's happening is that
as as you touch the resistance it

638
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
as as you touch the resistance it
 

639
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,030
as as you touch the resistance it
generates the Yang uh energy I

640
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
generates the Yang uh energy I
 

641
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,670
generates the Yang uh energy I
internalize the Yang energy it's going

642
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
internalize the Yang energy it's going
 

643
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,309
internalize the Yang energy it's going
to bounce off of the ground boom and

644
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:08,319
to bounce off of the ground boom and
 

645
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:11,509
to bounce off of the ground boom and
that's what's hitting him when we do our

646
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
that's what's hitting him when we do our
 

647
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,829
that's what's hitting him when we do our
Coq projections from uh any kind of grab

648
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
Coq projections from uh any kind of grab
 

649
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,110
Coq projections from uh any kind of grab
technique it's just a less Dynamic

650
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
technique it's just a less Dynamic
 

651
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,430
technique it's just a less Dynamic
version of when when I

652
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:22,440
version of when when I
 

653
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,990
version of when when I
hit okay uh but it's the same exact

654
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
hit okay uh but it's the same exact
 

655
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,030
hit okay uh but it's the same exact
mechanics okay so for example I'm never

656
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
mechanics okay so for example I'm never
 

657
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,030
mechanics okay so for example I'm never
I'm never hitting this the surface of

658
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm never hitting this the surface of
 

659
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,910
I'm never hitting this the surface of
him his Mass goes through generates that

660
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
him his Mass goes through generates that
 

661
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,670
him his Mass goes through generates that
entire thing and you have a

662
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
entire thing and you have a
 

663
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,110
entire thing and you have a
ballistic more Dynamic CQ projection

664
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,120
ballistic more Dynamic CQ projection
 

665
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,990
ballistic more Dynamic CQ projection
okay that's what we're trying to do so

666
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
okay that's what we're trying to do so
 

667
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,430
okay that's what we're trying to do so
in order to do that the back foot has to

668
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
in order to do that the back foot has to
 

669
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,269
in order to do that the back foot has to
be engaged in this case because that's

670
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:52,279
be engaged in this case because that's
 

671
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,389
be engaged in this case because that's
the foot that's going to be the

672
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:53,399
the foot that's going to be the
 

673
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,870
the foot that's going to be the
grounding foot okay um so why don't we

674
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
grounding foot okay um so why don't we
 

675
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,269
grounding foot okay um so why don't we
try just a little percussiveness I don't

676
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
try just a little percussiveness I don't
 

677
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,470
try just a little percussiveness I don't
want you to hurt anyone okay but we'll

678
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
want you to hurt anyone okay but we'll
 

679
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,829
want you to hurt anyone okay but we'll
do it with multiple

680
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
do it with multiple
 

681
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,549
do it with multiple
people and it's really because it's it's

682
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:11,559
people and it's really because it's it's
 

683
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,990
people and it's really because it's it's
it's my boys here I want you to feel

684
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
it's my boys here I want you to feel
 

685
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,429
it's my boys here I want you to feel
what's going to happen Okay so in the

686
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
what's going to happen Okay so in the
 

687
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,470
what's going to happen Okay so in the
last one when I pushed you right

688
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,480
last one when I pushed you right
 

689
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,270
last one when I pushed you right
remember and I just pushed you you felt

690
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,280
remember and I just pushed you you felt
 

691
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,069
remember and I just pushed you you felt
the the energy be displaced you all you

692
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,079
the the energy be displaced you all you
 

693
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,829
the the energy be displaced you all you
went backwards you see that right now

694
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
went backwards you see that right now
 

695
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,070
went backwards you see that right now
this resistance is going to increase

696
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,080
this resistance is going to increase
 

697
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,990
this resistance is going to increase
what the Yang energy so the Y now when I

698
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,000
what the Yang energy so the Y now when I
 

699
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,110
what the Yang energy so the Y now when I
go

700
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
go
 

701
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,909
go
ballistic it's going to go into his

702
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
ballistic it's going to go into his
 

703
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,510
ballistic it's going to go into his
body

704
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
body
 

705
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,470
body
um and and more stay in his body okay as

706
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:45,480
um and and more stay in his body okay as
 

707
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,830
um and and more stay in his body okay as
opposed to this is pushing you you

708
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
opposed to this is pushing you you
 

709
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,630
opposed to this is pushing you you
see this one you'll feel it more in your

710
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,640
see this one you'll feel it more in your
 

711
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,669
see this one you'll feel it more in your
body so don't do it too hard okay so

712
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
body so don't do it too hard okay so
 

713
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,830
body so don't do it too hard okay so
just in his

714
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
just in his
 

715
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,310
just in his
body see same displacement

716
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,320
body see same displacement
 

717
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,549
body see same displacement
back on

718
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:01,559
back on
 

719
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,190
back on
him okay and you can hear the th of it

720
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,200
him okay and you can hear the th of it
 

721
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,070
him okay and you can hear the th of it
with just a little flick of the wrist

722
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
with just a little flick of the wrist
 

723
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,470
with just a little flick of the wrist
okay all right let's see what you

724
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,480
okay all right let's see what you
 

725
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,350
okay all right let's see what you
get okay so another way uh you don't

726
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,360
get okay so another way uh you don't
 

727
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,830
get okay so another way uh you don't
have to hit your partner and do it okay

728
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:14,840
have to hit your partner and do it okay
 

729
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,430
have to hit your partner and do it okay
is uh you'll just do the the standard C

730
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
is uh you'll just do the the standard C
 

731
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,549
is uh you'll just do the the standard C
you okay so we're focusing on the back

732
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:19,559
you okay so we're focusing on the back
 

733
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,830
you okay so we're focusing on the back
foot cannot run it you need it for your

734
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
foot cannot run it you need it for your
 

735
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,669
foot cannot run it you need it for your
midfoot so what what I'm going to do is

736
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:24,679
midfoot so what what I'm going to do is
 

737
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,669
midfoot so what what I'm going to do is
is uh push get them to be that young

738
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:28,679
is uh push get them to be that young
 

739
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,190
is uh push get them to be that young
energy you see like I I don't want him

740
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
energy you see like I I don't want him
 

741
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,630
energy you see like I I don't want him
to have that space I want to I want to

742
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:33,640
to have that space I want to I want to
 

743
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,230
to have that space I want to I want to
Stack Up You See It generates more young

744
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
Stack Up You See It generates more young
 

745
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,710
Stack Up You See It generates more young
energy okay so that goes into the back

746
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:39,720
energy okay so that goes into the back
 

747
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,870
energy okay so that goes into the back
foot and you'll be able to project them

748
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
foot and you'll be able to project them
 

749
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,710
foot and you'll be able to project them
and it's the same mechanically is the

750
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
and it's the same mechanically is the
 

751
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,710
and it's the same mechanically is the
exact same thing uh as a ballistic

752
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:47,720
exact same thing uh as a ballistic
 

753
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,750
exact same thing uh as a ballistic
strike okay so one more time ground and

754
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
strike okay so one more time ground and
 

755
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,750
strike okay so one more time ground and
mid vector midfoot vector the back foot

756
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:54,760
mid vector midfoot vector the back foot
 

757
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,669
mid vector midfoot vector the back foot
get the Yang energy going and then boom

758
00:18:58,669 --> 00:18:58,679
get the Yang energy going and then boom
 

759
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,549
get the Yang energy going and then boom
project out okay let's try it okay we'll

760
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559
project out okay let's try it okay we'll
 

761
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,789
project out okay let's try it okay we'll
take that now into the yumii Drone okay

762
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
take that now into the yumii Drone okay
 

763
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,549
take that now into the yumii Drone okay
so I move

764
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:07,559
so I move
 

765
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,430
so I move
move and then we do the other

766
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
move and then we do the other
 

767
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,750
move and then we do the other
side shift

768
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
side shift
 

769
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,230
side shift
move okay let's try yeah okay so if

770
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
move okay let's try yeah okay so if
 

771
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,149
move okay let's try yeah okay so if
you're doing a yashi in EO you're going

772
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:20,159
you're doing a yashi in EO you're going
 

773
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,950
you're doing a yashi in EO you're going
to look for these things so the knee is

774
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960
to look for these things so the knee is
 

775
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,270
to look for these things so the knee is
going to go to the toes I'm going to

776
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,280
going to go to the toes I'm going to
 

777
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,990
going to go to the toes I'm going to
bring a line of gravity to one contact

778
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,000
bring a line of gravity to one contact
 

779
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,549
bring a line of gravity to one contact
point at a time I'll probably half moon

780
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:29,559
point at a time I'll probably half moon
 

781
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,590
point at a time I'll probably half moon
in the technique especially because of

782
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
in the technique especially because of
 

783
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,990
in the technique especially because of
the spiring geometry of iido Kaza

784
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,000
the spiring geometry of iido Kaza
 

785
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,789
the spiring geometry of iido Kaza
architectures okay um but it's

786
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
architectures okay um but it's
 

787
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,190
architectures okay um but it's
definitely

788
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
definitely
 

789
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,149
definitely
not that you

790
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:45,159
not that you
 

791
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,870
not that you
see no okay so if I was doing it with

792
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:49,880
see no okay so if I was doing it with
 

793
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,230
see no okay so if I was doing it with
strikes you would see uh bring the knee

794
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,240
strikes you would see uh bring the knee
 

795
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,549
strikes you would see uh bring the knee
to the toe line of gravity comes to that

796
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
to the toe line of gravity comes to that
 

797
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,270
to the toe line of gravity comes to that
foot push off of that one foot leave it

798
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
foot push off of that one foot leave it
 

799
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,190
foot push off of that one foot leave it
in place boom and then you would strike

800
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,200
in place boom and then you would strike
 

801
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,590
in place boom and then you would strike
okay in EO we'll do IH me first it's

802
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:06,600
okay in EO we'll do IH me first it's
 

803
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,149
okay in EO we'll do IH me first it's
right here there's the shift there's the

804
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
right here there's the shift there's the
 

805
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:17,110
right here there's the shift there's the
single line push back fo stays where it

806
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120

 

807
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,990

is and then again as I move

808
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,000

 

809
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,230

forward it doesn't matter if I'm doing

810
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
forward it doesn't matter if I'm doing
 

811
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,669
forward it doesn't matter if I'm doing
po that is the same thing here it is

812
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:30,679
po that is the same thing here it is
 

813
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:38,750
po that is the same thing here it is
right there in push

814
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:38,760

knee

822
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200

 

823
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,070

it's not going to work

824
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,080

 

825
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,669

okay thank

826
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679

 

827
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,230

you so you see how you picked that foot

828
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
you so you see how you picked that foot
 

829
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,390
you so you see how you picked that foot
up that's cuz your line of gravity is

830
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
up that's cuz your line of gravity is
 

831
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,549
up that's cuz your line of gravity is
between your two contact

832
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559

 

833
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:38,390

points better but you kind of fell

834
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400

 

835
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,470

right pick up the pace more energy push

836
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
right pick up the pace more energy push
 

837
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,149
right pick up the pace more energy push
push

838
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
push
 

839
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,029
push
push more

840
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
push more
 

841
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,789
push more
energy you picked your foot up

842
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:53,799

 

843
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,669

again there's that foot up and you see

844
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:56,679
again there's that foot up and you see
 

845
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,830
again there's that foot up and you see
energy is leaking behind you

846
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
energy is leaking behind you
 

847
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,070
energy is leaking behind you
okay energy

848
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,080
okay energy
 

849
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,830
okay energy
Ronin you guys see you get what I'm

850
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
Ronin you guys see you get what I'm
 

851
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,390
Ronin you guys see you get what I'm
talking energy is

852
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,400
talking energy is
 

853
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,750
talking energy is
leaking so as uh

854
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
leaking so as uh
 

855
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,070
leaking so as uh
just you're pushing on me you're pushing

856
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,080
just you're pushing on me you're pushing
 

857
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,470
just you're pushing on me you're pushing
him you see and they're pushing

858
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:17,480
him you see and they're pushing
 

859
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,590
him you see and they're pushing
me I'm not going to get there and just

860
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:20,600
me I'm not going to get there and just
 

861
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,110
me I'm not going to get there and just
like the Jo drill you see so I have to

862
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
like the Jo drill you see so I have to
 

863
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,390
like the Jo drill you see so I have to
be on this foot and that foot has to

864
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:25,400
be on this foot and that foot has to
 

865
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,470
be on this foot and that foot has to
shift so it's not on this foot this foot

866
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
shift so it's not on this foot this foot
 

867
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,430
shift so it's not on this foot this foot
now moves and then I shift to this foot

868
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
now moves and then I shift to this foot
 

869
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,990
now moves and then I shift to this foot
and then this foot now goes

870
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
and then this foot now goes
 

871
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,029
and then this foot now goes
in

872
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:36,039
in
 

873
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,110
in
okay oh here and I can

874
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,120

 

875
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,750

move okay

876
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:44,760
move okay
 

877
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,750
move okay
so one more

878
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:48,760
so one more
 

879
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,830
so one more
indicator you pick your foot up high

880
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
indicator you pick your foot up high
 

881
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,470
indicator you pick your foot up high
it's almost guaranteed that your line of

882
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
it's almost guaranteed that your line of
 

883
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,549
it's almost guaranteed that your line of
gravity is between the two feet okay if

884
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:57,559
gravity is between the two feet okay if
 

885
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,070
gravity is between the two feet okay if
you watch watch my feet they're sliding

886
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
you watch watch my feet they're sliding
 

887
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,350
you watch watch my feet they're sliding
on the

888
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,360
on the
 

889
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,669
on the
M why because line of gravity is on one

890
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
M why because line of gravity is on one
 

891
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,070
M why because line of gravity is on one
foot that's why the other foot can move

892
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
foot that's why the other foot can move
 

893
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,990
foot that's why the other foot can move
freely okay so we going and you'll see

894
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
freely okay so we going and you'll see
 

895
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,669
freely okay so we going and you'll see
how my feet are

896
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:14,679
how my feet are
 

897
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,789
how my feet are
sliding okay so let's try to get the

898
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:17,799
sliding okay so let's try to get the
 

899
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,080
sliding okay so let's try to get the
sliding feet too go
