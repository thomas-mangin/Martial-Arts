1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:42,830

so

2
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:56,830

so

00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840

 

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:24,830

so

6
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

7
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:42,230

so

8
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240

 

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,990

so he's not walking around

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
so he's not walking around
 

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,590
so he's not walking around
me right

12
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600

 

13
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,870

keep your arm where you are and go

14
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
keep your arm where you are and go
 

15
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,190
keep your arm where you are and go
that way you get it so

16
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
that way you get it so
 

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,230
that way you get it so
the way i keep him with me is

18
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
the way i keep him with me is
 

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,870
the way i keep him with me is
i keep pushing this arm like that

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
i keep pushing this arm like that
 

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,710
i keep pushing this arm like that
so as he tries to go i keep moving it

22
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
so as he tries to go i keep moving it
 

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,430
so as he tries to go i keep moving it
forward

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
forward
 

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,670
forward
he tries to go that way i keep moving it

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
he tries to go that way i keep moving it
 

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,710
he tries to go that way i keep moving it
okay so this arm goes here

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
okay so this arm goes here
 

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,229
okay so this arm goes here
and then you're gonna you're gonna lose

30
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
and then you're gonna you're gonna lose
 

31
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,630
and then you're gonna you're gonna lose
you're gonna lose it at a certain point

you're gonna lose it at a certain point

you're gonna lose it at a certain point
and in the yin young world that's where

and in the yin young world that's where
 

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,110
and in the yin young world that's where
the other arm comes

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,110

so who is doing that

38

is not him following me

289
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,790

over here is inward spiral again
