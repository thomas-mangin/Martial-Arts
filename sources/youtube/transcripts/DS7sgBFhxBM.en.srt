the art is
concentric and throughout the centuries

a good way of understanding that is is

internally you're not supposed to have

internally you're not supposed to have
 

25
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,710
internally you're not supposed to have

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,870
contestation
externally um no matter how much I so

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:39,880
externally um no matter how much I so

for
 

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,789
for
example um I might use a cultivation

32
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:43,799
example um I might use a cultivation
 

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,670
example um I might use a cultivation
drill where he's pressing and he's

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
drill where he's pressing and he's

pushing okay with spinal displacement

pushing okay with spinal displacement
 

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,550
pushing okay with spinal displacement
and then I internalize that and that is

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
and then I internalize that and that is
 

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,910
and then I internalize that and that is
a way of developing that internally I'm

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:56,920
a way of developing that internally I'm
 

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,670
a way of developing that internally I'm
not contesting but externally this is a

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:00,680
not contesting but externally this is a
 

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,670
not contesting but externally this is a
contestation you see so hence the art

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
contestation you see so hence the art
 

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,990

will move things so same thing

46
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
will move things so same thing
 

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,390
will move things so same thing
internally I'm doing the same uh yield

48
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
internally I'm doing the same uh yield
 

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,910
internally I'm doing the same uh yield
so for ex or the same internal non-c

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
so for ex or the same internal non-c
 

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,229
so for ex or the same internal non-c
contestation so for example if he comes

52
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
contestation so for example if he comes
 

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,229
contestation so for example if he comes
out and he now pushes on that

54
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:19,239
out and he now pushes on that
 

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,070
out and he now pushes on that
angle it's not going anywhere do you see

56
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
angle it's not going anywhere do you see

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,309

I don't I

58
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
I don't I
 

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,270
I don't I
don't I think people make a mistake is

60
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
don't I think people make a mistake is
 

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,949
don't I think people make a mistake is
that they take that internal cultivation

62
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
that they take that internal cultivation
 

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,190
that they take that internal cultivation
field and then violated at the external

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
field and then violated at the external
 

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,750
field and then violated at the external
level this is not concentric thought

66
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
level this is not concentric thought
 

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,710
level this is not concentric thought
okay so just because I move into an

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:41,720
okay so just because I move into an

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,270
okay so just because I move into an
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm

70
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm
 

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,830
external yield it doesn't mean that I'm
not doing the same exact thing okay I am

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
not doing the same exact thing okay I am
 

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,390
not doing the same exact thing okay I am
doing the same exact thing internally

74
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
doing the same exact thing internally
 

75
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,589
doing the same exact thing internally
I'm just now concentrically consistent

76
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
I'm just now concentrically consistent
 

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,430
I'm just now concentrically consistent
throughout my movement okay so you

78
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
throughout my movement okay so you
 

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,869
throughout my movement okay so you
have you have a um uh

80
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:01,879
have you have a um uh
 

81
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,149
have you have a um uh
internal internalization so internally

82
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
internal internalization so internally
 

83
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,630
internal internalization so internally
I'm not contesting and you can do all of

84
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm not contesting and you can do all of
 

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,630
I'm not contesting and you can do all of
this you see on an external

86
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,640
this you see on an external
 

87
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,589
this you see on an external
contestation okay so all I'm doing here

88
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:16,599
contestation okay so all I'm doing here
 

89
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,309
contestation okay so all I'm doing here
is you're you're pushing at me and then

90
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
is you're you're pushing at me and then
 

91
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,670
is you're you're pushing at me and then
I remain internal and and I can just go

92
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
I remain internal and and I can just go
 

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,309
I remain internal and and I can just go
through you you see but that's not the

94
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
through you you see but that's not the
 

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,990
through you you see but that's not the
art okay because I'm just pushing

96
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,000
art okay because I'm just pushing
 

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,470
art okay because I'm just pushing
externally on this line okay so I have

98
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,480
externally on this line okay so I have
 

99
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,229
externally on this line okay so I have
to go around this

100
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
to go around this
 

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,550
to go around this
point you

102
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,560

 

103
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,789

see and any point in the turn any point

104
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
see and any point in the turn any point
 

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,270
see and any point in the turn any point
in the turn so let's say we're here and

106
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:50,280
in the turn so let's say we're here and
 

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,750
in the turn so let's say we're here and
he comes

108
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
he comes
 

109
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,190
he comes
out it's the

110
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
out it's the
 

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,390
out it's the
same

112
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
same
 

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,069
same
okay there you go

114
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:00,079
okay there you go
 

115
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,110
okay there you go
comes

comes
out it's the

118
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040

 

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,390

same and any angle so for

120
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
same and any angle so for
 

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,590
same and any angle so for
example here's this part come out sit

122
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600

 

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,909

up you

124
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
up you
 

125
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,110
up you
see so as you guys are getting able to

126
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
see so as you guys are getting able to
 

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,590
see so as you guys are getting able to
internalize their energy all you're

128
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
internalize their energy all you're
 

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,749
internalize their energy all you're
doing with it now though is trying to be

130
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
doing with it now though is trying to be
 

131
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,590
doing with it now though is trying to be
more powerful you see so and so you're

132
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
more powerful you see so and so you're
 

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,430
more powerful you see so and so you're
like oh I'm going to put the qua into

134
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,440
like oh I'm going to put the qua into
 

135
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,909
like oh I'm going to put the qua into
that and you're very powerful now but

136
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:38,919
that and you're very powerful now but
 

137
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,870
that and you're very powerful now but
it's not the art okay so I still use the

138
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
it's not the art okay so I still use the
 

139
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,390
it's not the art okay so I still use the
qua but I'm going around eny you see and

140
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
qua but I'm going around eny you see and
 

141
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,590
qua but I'm going around eny you see and
it's extremely soft right okay and so

142
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,600
it's extremely soft right okay and so
 

143
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,029
it's extremely soft right okay and so
same thing here you can go here and drop

144
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,039
same thing here you can go here and drop
 

145
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,550
same thing here you can go here and drop
the chi do you

146
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
the chi do you
 

147
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,150
the chi do you
see but I I as I am

148
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
see but I I as I am
 

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,870
see but I I as I am
not contesting so same thing see feel

150
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:03,880
not contesting so same thing see feel
 

151
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,310
not contesting so same thing see feel
that contesting angle so I go this way

152
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
that contesting angle so I go this way
 

153
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,150
that contesting angle so I go this way
you see okay well and then same thing

154
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,160
you see okay well and then same thing
 

155
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,670
you see okay well and then same thing
here you're like there oh I got you

156
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
here you're like there oh I got you
 

157
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,790
here you're like there oh I got you
because I can qua the hell out of you do

158
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:13,800
because I can qua the hell out of you do
 

159
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,270
because I can qua the hell out of you do
you see but look

160
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,280

 

161
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,629

all so if I could sum up this

162
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:21,639
all so if I could sum up this
 

163
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,350
all so if I could sum up this
point

164
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
point
 

165
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,990
point
historically it's an concentric

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
historically it's an concentric
 

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,510
historically it's an concentric
epistemology what you're doing on the

168
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,520
epistemology what you're doing on the
 

169
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,029
epistemology what you're doing on the

207
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,830
it's not quite the same okay okay
remember it's a kind of inverse

dropping okay so the same thing as I do
this my

236
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,360
this my
 

237
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,790
this my
skeletal system is giving me the

238
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
skeletal system is giving me the
 

239
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,550
skeletal system is giving me the
feedback that I can feel my tissue

240
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:39,560
feedback that I can feel my tissue
 

241
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,230

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,070
dropping okay you're giving me the
feedback by allowing me to follow that

244
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
feedback by allowing me to follow that
 

245
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,350

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,309
is telling me don't go here okay my
skeleton system is telling me let the

252
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
skeleton system is telling me let the
 

253
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,029
skeleton system is telling me let the
rest fall in contrast to that so you are

254
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:06,039
rest fall in contrast to that so you are
 

255
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,309
rest fall in contrast to that so you are
my contrast that's giving me my model to

256

won't you you can push at whatever angle
 

267
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,750
won't you you can push at whatever angle
okay and it won't

268

displacing uh you have to get off of

286
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,240
displacing uh you have to get off of
 

287
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,310

line
 

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,990
line
okay you have to get off that line no

292
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
okay you have to get off that line no
 

293
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,150
okay you have to get off that line no
not here and

295
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,110

then you can get off of it any number of

then you can get off of it any number of
 

297
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,430
then you can get off of it any number of
ways if you watch that video I got off

298
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
ways if you watch that video I got off
 

299
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,069
ways if you watch that video I got off
it any number of ways cuz he he comes in

300
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:03,079
it any number of ways cuz he he comes in
 

301
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:10,269
it any number of ways cuz he he comes in
a little different every time

303
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,870

okay reconcile yes internally you're

304
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:13,880
okay reconcile yes internally you're
 

305
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,550
okay reconcile yes internally you're
going to feel the young aspect that

306
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:15,560
going to feel the young aspect that
 

307
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,829
going to feel the young aspect that
you're internally reconciling but you go

308
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
you're internally reconciling but you go
 

309
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,389
you're internally reconciling but you go
around that

310
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
around that
 

311
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,550
around that
energy okay you're going to feel it

312
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
energy okay you're going to feel it
 

313
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,630
energy okay you're going to feel it
you're going to feel it go around the

you're going to feel it go around the
 

315
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,750
you're going to feel it go around the
energy okay and why I had you pushing is

316
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
energy okay and why I had you pushing is
 

317
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,829
energy okay and why I had you pushing is
to show that even though it's very soft

318
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:36,839
to show that even though it's very soft
 

319
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,870
to show that even though it's very soft
and doesn't have the contention model

320
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
and doesn't have the contention model
 

321
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,110
and doesn't have the contention model
that makes me feel powerful you can't do

322
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
that makes me feel powerful you can't do
 

323
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,389
that makes me feel powerful you can't do
anything to me just like if I stopped at

324
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:45,399
anything to me just like if I stopped at
 

325
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,829
anything to me just like if I stopped at
any point you can't push that arm in do

any point you can't push that arm in do
 

327
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,910
any point you can't push that arm in do
do you see that so yes it's it is

328
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
do you see that so yes it's it is
 

329
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,389
do you see that so yes it's it is
soft but what it really is is non-c

330
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:57,399
soft but what it really is is non-c

contesting do you see it's not if you
 

333
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,910
contesting do you see it's not if you
push if you push past that you would

feel right everything that you're trying

336
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
feel right everything that you're trying
 

337
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,430
feel right everything that you're trying
to

338
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
to
 

339
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,590
to
do which is integrity of your

340
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,600
do which is integrity of your
 

341
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,870
do which is integrity of your
organization I have integrity in my

342
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
organization I have integrity in my
 

343
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,269
organization I have integrity in my
organization but it never enters into

344
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
organization but it never enters into
 

345
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,030
organization but it never enters into
contest with you okay

346
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
contest with you okay
 

347
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,030
contest with you okay
okay if you

348
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
okay if you
 

349
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,389
okay if you
have a young

350
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:23,399
have a young
 

351
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,110
have a young
aspect going this way we don't want to

352
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
aspect going this way we don't want to
 

353
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,310
aspect going this way we don't want to
go that way okay

354
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
go that way okay
 

355
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,110
go that way okay
you're going to at a

356
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,120

 

357
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,030

minimum hit it at the 90 and so this is

358
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,040
minimum hit it at the 90 and so this is
 

359
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,230
minimum hit it at the 90 and so this is
what I

360
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
what I
 

361
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,069
what I
call um your 90° fluctuation cuz nothing

362
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
call um your 90° fluctuation cuz nothing
 

363
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,389
call um your 90° fluctuation cuz nothing
ever really stays like I mean it can but

364
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
ever really stays like I mean it can but
 

365
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,310
ever really stays like I mean it can but
we're not going to stay in this two

366
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
we're not going to stay in this two
 

367
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,710
we're not going to stay in this two
Dimension right so for example uh we're

368
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
Dimension right so for example uh we're
 

369
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,629
Dimension right so for example uh we're
always either SP rotating or counter

370
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
always either SP rotating or counter
 

371
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,990
always either SP rotating or counter
spir rotating okay so th this thing is

372
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
spir rotating okay so th this thing is
 

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,990
spir rotating okay so th this thing is
always going like that going like this

374
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,000
always going like that going like this
 

375
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,790
always going like that going like this
okay it's not going to do

376
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800

 

377
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,910

that so it'll be on a spiral which means

378
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:14,920
that so it'll be on a spiral which means
 

379
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,990
that so it'll be on a spiral which means
you're your 90° fluctuation is something

380
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
you're your 90° fluctuation is something
 

381
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,189
you're your 90° fluctuation is something
that's constant to that

382
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:24,199
that's constant to that
 

383
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,750
that's constant to that
spiral okay so for example if you have

384
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
spiral okay so for example if you have
 

385
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,990
spiral okay so for example if you have
one an a

386
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,000
one an a
 

387
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,030
one an a
a consistent so non uh fluctuating 90°

388
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,040
a consistent so non uh fluctuating 90°
 

389
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,910
a consistent so non uh fluctuating 90°
angle because you're on a spiral sooner

390
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:38,920
angle because you're on a spiral sooner
 

391
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,710
angle because you're on a spiral sooner
or later you're going to now violate the

392
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
or later you're going to now violate the
 

393
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,550
or later you're going to now violate the
rule so it's basically you did it here

394
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
rule so it's basically you did it here
 

395
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,629
rule so it's basically you did it here
you have a y Yong Clash there okay so

396
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:49,639
you have a y Yong Clash there okay so
 

397
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,670
you have a y Yong Clash there okay so
I'll show you what I

398
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
I'll show you what I
 

399
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,870
I'll show you what I
mean in this technique I'll use you

400
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:55,880
mean in this technique I'll use you
 

401
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,470
mean in this technique I'll use you
Maya and you're having the same thing on

402
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,480
Maya and you're having the same thing on
 

403
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,829
Maya and you're having the same thing on
certain okay so we'll just get to the

404
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
certain okay so we'll just get to the
 

405
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,629
certain okay so we'll just get to the
end this part here okay

406
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:07,639
end this part here okay
 

407
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,870
end this part here okay
so at at a certain point if you look at

408
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
so at at a certain point if you look at
 

409
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,829
so at at a certain point if you look at
her

410
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
her
 

411
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,150
her
head it is on a curve you see as it goes

412
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,160
head it is on a curve you see as it goes
 

413
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,670
head it is on a curve you see as it goes
down and you start that curve

414
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:22,680
down and you start that curve
 

415
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,790
down and you start that curve
okay but if your

416
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,800
okay but if your
 

417
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,110
okay but if your
angle is this

418
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
angle is this
 

419
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,670
angle is this
at a certain point it is no different

420
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
at a certain point it is no different
 

421
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,189
at a certain point it is no different
than if you're pushing her that way okay

422
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:38,199
than if you're pushing her that way okay
 

423
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,829
than if you're pushing her that way okay
so she's got a resistance to the throat

424
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
so she's got a resistance to the throat
 

425
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,910
so she's got a resistance to the throat
you see and you're trying to shove her

426
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:44,920
you see and you're trying to shove her
 

427
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,910
you see and you're trying to shove her
that way what you have to do

428
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:48,920
that way what you have to do
 

429
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,430
that way what you have to do
is here's her contention angle is just

430
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
is here's her contention angle is just
 

431
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,590
is here's her contention angle is just
has to keep going around her

432
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:54,600
has to keep going around her
 

433
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,509
has to keep going around her
head you feel that so we're just we'll

434
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:58,519
head you feel that so we're just we'll
 

435
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,749
head you feel that so we're just we'll
get there

436
00:13:59,749 --> 00:13:59,759
get there
 

437
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,990
get there
don't go here that's what strong to

438
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
don't go here that's what strong to
 

439
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,550
don't go here that's what strong to
you you're going around her

440
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560

 

441
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,069

head so watch how I'm doing that now I'm

442
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:15,079
head so watch how I'm doing that now I'm
 

443
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,430
head so watch how I'm doing that now I'm
going to bring her in not shove here I

444
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
going to bring her in not shove here I
 

445
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,150
going to bring her in not shove here I
going around her

446
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,160
going around her
 

447
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,790
going around her
head you guys see that so when you stand

448
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
head you guys see that so when you stand
 

449
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,749
head you guys see that so when you stand
up and you go here you to be careful cuz

450
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:30,759
up and you go here you to be careful cuz
 

451
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,389
up and you go here you to be careful cuz
you're going to smell it you see you're

452
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
you're going to smell it you see you're
 

453
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,870
you're going to smell it you see you're
going to push but you have to get around

454
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
going to push but you have to get around
 

455
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,870
going to push but you have to get around
her

456
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:35,880
her
 

457
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,230
her
head which is why my arm goes this way

458
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,240
head which is why my arm goes this way
 

459
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,990
head which is why my arm goes this way
and not this way and not that way it

460
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
and not this way and not that way it
 

461
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,629
and not this way and not that way it
keeps going around her head okay it's no

462
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:45,639
keeps going around her head okay it's no
 

463
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,350
keeps going around her head okay it's no
different

464
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
different
 

465
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,670
different
inag you're going to smell it but no

466
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
inag you're going to smell it but no
 

467
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,550
inag you're going to smell it but no
there is inertia to her standing as you

468
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,560
there is inertia to her standing as you
 

469
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,509
there is inertia to her standing as you
keep going around her head around her

470
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:58,519
keep going around her head around her
 

471
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,150
keep going around her head around her
head

472
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
head
 

473
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,269
head
okay there's no different so you have to

474
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:02,279
okay there's no different so you have to
 

475
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,990
okay there's no different so you have to
keep that 90° fluctuation you're doing

476
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,000
keep that 90° fluctuation you're doing
 

477
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,430
keep that 90° fluctuation you're doing
it at the beginning

478
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:06,440
it at the beginning
 

479
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,350
it at the beginning
too uh if I push

480
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
too uh if I push
 

481
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,389
too uh if I push
here at this point we're contesting no

482
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
here at this point we're contesting no
 

483
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,150
here at this point we're contesting no
different than here so I keep going

484
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,160
different than here so I keep going
 

485
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,470
different than here so I keep going
here's that contention point and I keep

486
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,480
here's that contention point and I keep
 

487
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,790
here's that contention point and I keep
going around it you

488
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:19,800
going around it you
 

489
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,870
going around it you
see then here's a contention point and I

490
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
see then here's a contention point and I
 

491
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,790
see then here's a contention point and I
keep going around it and around

492
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
keep going around it and around
 

493
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,509
keep going around it and around
it okay

494
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
it okay
 

495
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,550
it okay
and that is a simple kind of

496
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:33,560
and that is a simple kind of
 

497
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,629
and that is a simple kind of
mathematical way of understanding the

498
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:35,639
mathematical way of understanding the

try here here's that 180 so I have to
get off of it I go to that

510
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:51,639
get off of it I go to that
 

511
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,069
get off of it I go to that
90 okay here it is again so I go around

512
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
90 okay here it is again so I go around
 

513
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,629
90 okay here it is again so I go around
it you see there it is again I go around

it you see there it is again I go around
 

515
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,309
it you see there it is again I go around
it again you see okay then it's coming

516
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:04,319
it again you see okay then it's coming
 

517
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:07,150
it again you see okay then it's coming
back it's right here I go to the inside

518
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,160
back it's right here I go to the inside
 

519
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,430
back it's right here I go to the inside
of it okay here it is again don't shove

520
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
of it okay here it is again don't shove

down I got to go this way to have the
 

525
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,230
down I got to go this way to have the
angle if I go this way I'll never get it

526
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,240
angle if I go this way I'll never get it
 

527
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,069
angle if I go this way I'll never get it
I have to go this

90 here it is again go around it there
 

535
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,749
90 here it is again go around it there
it is again go around it more okay here

it is again go around it more okay here
 

537
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,710
it is again go around it more okay here
it is again go on the inside go around
