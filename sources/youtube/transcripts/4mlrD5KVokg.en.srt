1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,629

all right come closer

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
all right come closer
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,670
all right come closer
every all right so I have an inward

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:06,680
every all right so I have an inward
 

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,150
every all right so I have an inward
spiral and I have an outward spiral I

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
spiral and I have an outward spiral I
 

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,789
spiral and I have an outward spiral I
have my shoulder ability to free my

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:13,799
have my shoulder ability to free my
 

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,990
have my shoulder ability to free my
shoulder uh will you put a hand on me so

10
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,000
shoulder uh will you put a hand on me so
 

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,269
shoulder uh will you put a hand on me so
sometimes it doesn't show up in my in

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
sometimes it doesn't show up in my in
 

13
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,710
sometimes it doesn't show up in my in
the G okay so I have a shoulder to free

14
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:23,720
the G okay so I have a shoulder to free
 

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,870
the G okay so I have a shoulder to free
and you can go back forward and back

16
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,880
and you can go back forward and back
 

17
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,710
and you can go back forward and back
forward and back okay and then the same

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
forward and back okay and then the same
 

19
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,470
forward and back okay and then the same
thing you have a qua the the qua can

20
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
thing you have a qua the the qua can
 

21
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,510
thing you have a qua the the qua can
free you feel that Chris right okay all

22
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,520
free you feel that Chris right okay all
 

23
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,590
free you feel that Chris right okay all
right

24
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
right
 

25
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,350
right
so I also as a marker I have a grid a

26
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,360
so I also as a marker I have a grid a
 

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,190
so I also as a marker I have a grid a
vertical grid on my

28
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,200
vertical grid on my
 

29
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,549
vertical grid on my
body there's two grids on my body well

30
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:47,559
body there's two grids on my body well
 

31
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,110
body there's two grids on my body well
one's a perimeter I have my outer rim

32
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
one's a perimeter I have my outer rim
 

33
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,990
one's a perimeter I have my outer rim
which is a Parker's concept and my uh

34
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
which is a Parker's concept and my uh
 

35
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,670
which is a Parker's concept and my uh
defense offense doesn't go outside my

36
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,680
defense offense doesn't go outside my
 

37
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,189
defense offense doesn't go outside my
shoulder line nor above the Arc of the

38
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
shoulder line nor above the Arc of the
 

39
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,390
shoulder line nor above the Arc of the
top of my head so it's like a egg shape

40
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:07,400
top of my head so it's like a egg shape
 

41
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,429
top of my head so it's like a egg shape
and then it comes down to the groin and

42
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
and then it comes down to the groin and
 

43
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,710
and then it comes down to the groin and
so all my defense offense and my hand

44
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,720
so all my defense offense and my hand
 

45
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,230
so all my defense offense and my hand
workk is in that area um but more

46
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
workk is in that area um but more
 

47
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,429
workk is in that area um but more
particularly I would ask you to think of

48
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
particularly I would ask you to think of
 

49
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,469
particularly I would ask you to think of
it as your elbows your elbows have to

50
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:19,479
it as your elbows your elbows have to
 

51
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,390
it as your elbows your elbows have to
stay in that area your hands can go out

52
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,400
stay in that area your hands can go out
 

53
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,630
stay in that area your hands can go out
of it but your elbows can't

54
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640
of it but your elbows can't
 

55
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,109
of it but your elbows can't
okay then I have another grid made up of

56
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
okay then I have another grid made up of
 

57
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,469
okay then I have another grid made up of
vertical lines so one's on the shoulder

58
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:29,479
vertical lines so one's on the shoulder
 

59
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,910
vertical lines so one's on the shoulder
the outside side shoulder and then one

60
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
the outside side shoulder and then one
 

61
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,870
the outside side shoulder and then one
comes down the middle chest one down the

62
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
comes down the middle chest one down the
 

63
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,710
comes down the middle chest one down the
middle of my body and then you have the

64
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
middle of my body and then you have the
 

65
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,389
middle of my body and then you have the
same thing on the other

66
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:38,399
same thing on the other
 

67
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,069
same thing on the other
side

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
side
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,069
side
okay and

70
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,079
okay and
 

71
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,990
okay and
between my inward spiral and my outward

72
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
between my inward spiral and my outward
 

73
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,990
between my inward spiral and my outward
spiral my freeing shoulder both forward

74
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000
spiral my freeing shoulder both forward
 

75
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,190
spiral my freeing shoulder both forward
and backwards and my qua forward and

76
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
and backwards and my qua forward and
 

77
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,429
and backwards and my qua forward and
backwards which includes inside and

78
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
backwards which includes inside and
 

79
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,310
backwards which includes inside and
outside you make up whatever

80
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
outside you make up whatever
 

81
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,190
outside you make up whatever
um spiral you need to generate whatever

82
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
um spiral you need to generate whatever
 

83
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,109
um spiral you need to generate whatever
effect you need on the UK you don't do

84
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
effect you need on the UK you don't do
 

85
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,990
effect you need on the UK you don't do
anything other than those things okay

86
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
anything other than those things okay
 

87
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,710
anything other than those things okay
and then whatever spiral I end up oping

88
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,720
and then whatever spiral I end up oping
 

89
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,509
and then whatever spiral I end up oping
oping for it is going to never have my

90
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519
oping for it is going to never have my
 

91
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,589
oping for it is going to never have my
elbows go outside the outer

92
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:22,599
elbows go outside the outer
 

93
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,470
elbows go outside the outer
rim and my inward

94
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480
rim and my inward
 

95
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,630
rim and my inward
spiral is going to take my elbow from

96
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
spiral is going to take my elbow from
 

97
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,030
spiral is going to take my elbow from
the y line on the outside that shoulder

98
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
the y line on the outside that shoulder
 

99
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,430
the y line on the outside that shoulder
line and bring it in

100
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
line and bring it in
 

101
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,430
line and bring it in
towards this midline here okay at least

102
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
towards this midline here okay at least
 

103
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,949
towards this midline here okay at least
to this half chest which is the yin line

104
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
to this half chest which is the yin line
 

105
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,070
to this half chest which is the yin line
it has to do that and then your outward

106
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
it has to do that and then your outward
 

107
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,589
it has to do that and then your outward
spiral has to do has to do the opposite

108
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
spiral has to do has to do the opposite
 

109
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,350
spiral has to do has to do the opposite
so it has to come from either the

110
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,360
so it has to come from either the
 

111
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,949
so it has to come from either the
midline or the yin line and it brings

112
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
midline or the yin line and it brings
 

113
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,869
midline or the yin line and it brings
your elbow back to that Y Line

114
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
your elbow back to that Y Line
 

115
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,710
your elbow back to that Y Line
okay all right with that

116
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,720
okay all right with that
 

117
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,110
okay all right with that
as he's here and I know that I in my

118
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
as he's here and I know that I in my
 

119
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,630
as he's here and I know that I in my
spiral I have gon and when I want to

120
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
spiral I have gon and when I want to
 

121
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,030
spiral I have gon and when I want to
change this that's when you would have

122
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,040
change this that's when you would have
 

123
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,030
change this that's when you would have
Chon okay there's

124
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,040
Chon okay there's
 

125
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,990
Chon okay there's
Chon and then you also would have um

126
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000

 

127
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,710

doog so I can combine them in some very

128
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720
doog so I can combine them in some very
 

129
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,910
doog so I can combine them in some very
strange

130
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
strange
 

131
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,309
strange
ways to get this to work work

132
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:31,319
ways to get this to work work
 

133
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,789
ways to get this to work work
okay obviously if I go get on right and

134
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
okay obviously if I go get on right and
 

135
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,429
okay obviously if I go get on right and
I move my body in and you can continue

136
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:40,439
I move my body in and you can continue
 

137
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,830
I move my body in and you can continue
the spiral and you get more out of this

138
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
the spiral and you get more out of this
 

139
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,309
the spiral and you get more out of this
as you move your body in out rotate in

140
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:47,319
as you move your body in out rotate in
 

141
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,030
as you move your body in out rotate in
or out Etc okay the one I want you to

142
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
or out Etc okay the one I want you to
 

143
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,550
or out Etc okay the one I want you to
feel right now is that first one so I'm

144
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
feel right now is that first one so I'm
 

145
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,830
feel right now is that first one so I'm
going to go in so my elbow's going to

146
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:56,840
going to go in so my elbow's going to
 

147
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,149
going to go in so my elbow's going to
start on the outside and come in

148
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,159
start on the outside and come in
 

149
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,190
start on the outside and come in
then I'm going to start the inward

150
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
then I'm going to start the inward
 

151
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,190
then I'm going to start the inward
spiral from here which is chew on you

152
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,200
spiral from here which is chew on you
 

153
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,550
spiral from here which is chew on you
see and I'm going to take it in the

154
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
see and I'm going to take it in the
 

155
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,310
see and I'm going to take it in the
jodon make it go over my

makes no martial
sense and he was already falling from

508
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
sense and he was already falling from
 

509
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,549
sense and he was already falling from
the angle

510
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:07,559

 

511
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,029

that so I'm not

512
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,039
that so I'm not
 

513
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,390
that so I'm not
going

514
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
going
 

515
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,110
going
here

516
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
here
 

517
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,510
here
here I'm not accelerating him he was

518
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:18,520
here I'm not accelerating him he was
 

519
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,590
here I'm not accelerating him he was
already being

520
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:20,600
already being
 

521
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,270
already being
accelerated what I am

522
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
accelerated what I am
 

523
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,069
accelerated what I am
doing is there's that energy is going

524
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
doing is there's that energy is going
 

525
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,150
doing is there's that energy is going
here like this

526
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,160
here like this
 

527
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,070
here like this
and then I'm going to take this and it

528
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
and then I'm going to take this and it
 

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,590
and then I'm going to take this and it
becomes a a

530
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600

 

531
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,190

push so it's an inward

532
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,200
push so it's an inward
 

533
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,230
push so it's an inward
elbow boom boom it's in

534
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,240
elbow boom boom it's in
 

535
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,230
elbow boom boom it's in
elbow

536
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,240
elbow
 

537
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,710
elbow
okay so I would do this if you're

538
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,720
okay so I would do this if you're
 

539
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,990
okay so I would do this if you're
training I would try to do this

540
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,000

 

541
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,510

one and not do this so that I can can do

542
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:00,520
one and not do this so that I can can do
 

543
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,270
one and not do this so that I can can do
this okay and do it

544
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
this okay and do it
 

545
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,830
this okay and do it
in

546
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
in
 

547
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,950
in
so

548
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
so
 

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,549
so
externally that's what what you're doing

550
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
externally that's what what you're doing
 

551
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,149
externally that's what what you're doing
okay and you get X energy out of that

552
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:15,159
okay and you get X energy out of that
 

553
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,190
okay and you get X energy out of that
okay but what's my what are my hands

554
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
okay but what's my what are my hands
 

555
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,230
okay but what's my what are my hands
doing in terms of

556
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,240
doing in terms of
 

557
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,190
doing in terms of
elevation either

558
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
elevation either
 

559
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,630
elevation either
dropping so that tells you what's the

560
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:25,640
dropping so that tells you what's the
 

561
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,430
dropping so that tells you what's the
chi doing dropping the Chi's dropping

562
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,440
chi doing dropping the Chi's dropping
 

563
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,590
chi doing dropping the Chi's dropping
okay and so this this hand that comes

564
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
okay and so this this hand that comes
 

565
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,870
okay and so this this hand that comes
here oh is very very heavy it's not

566
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
here oh is very very heavy it's not
 

567
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,830
here oh is very very heavy it's not
looking over here to do this kind of

568
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
looking over here to do this kind of
 

569
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,549
looking over here to do this kind of
stuff

570
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:43,559
stuff
 

571
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,230
stuff
okay so as I come

572
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,240
okay so as I come
 

573
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,270
okay so as I come
around very very heavy okay more like ma

574
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280
around very very heavy okay more like ma
 

575
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,870
around very very heavy okay more like ma
hand what it should feel like okay so

576
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:55,880
hand what it should feel like okay so
 

577
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:04,070
hand what it should feel like okay so
you have to let that Che drop

578
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080

 

579
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,750

that way he's off

580
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
that way he's off
 

581
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,950
that way he's off
balance cuz he he's almost about to fall

582
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
balance cuz he he's almost about to fall
 

583
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,990
balance cuz he he's almost about to fall
right you could get him to fall there

584
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
right you could get him to fall there
 

585
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,830
right you could get him to fall there
but sh and that's where we're

586
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:14,840
but sh and that's where we're
 

587
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,549
but sh and that's where we're
going is a technique when someone was

588
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:17,559
going is a technique when someone was
 

589
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,549
going is a technique when someone was
about to fall and then did not fall

590
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:19,559
about to fall and then did not fall
 

591
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,350
about to fall and then did not fall
that's where that's where the opening of

592
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
that's where that's where the opening of
 

593
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,350
that's where that's where the opening of
sha is

594
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
sha is
 

595
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,390
sha is
okay so if you and we're going to do one

596
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:27,400
okay so if you and we're going to do one
 

597
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,310
okay so if you and we're going to do one
more progression before we get to the

598
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,320
more progression before we get to the
 

599
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,310
more progression before we get to the
technique but if you pay

600
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
technique but if you pay
 

601
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,230
technique but if you pay
attention as he tries to get his

602
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,240
attention as he tries to get his
 

603
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,110
attention as he tries to get his
balance you see he did not fall there's

604
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,120
balance you see he did not fall there's
 

605
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,870
balance you see he did not fall there's
the Tilt for Shon right

606
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
the Tilt for Shon right
 

607
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,029
the Tilt for Shon right
here it's more his job it's not me

608
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:52,039

 

609
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,590

going because I would be taking them out

610
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:54,600
going because I would be taking them out
 

611
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,830
going because I would be taking them out
of check pay attention

612
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840

 

613
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,830

he not in check he starts to go he's not

614
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
he not in check he starts to go he's not
 

615
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,630
he not in check he starts to go he's not
in

616
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
in
 

617
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,149
in
check

618
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
check
 

619
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,470
check
okay we don't want to do that all right

620
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:11,480
okay we don't want to do that all right
 

621
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,470
okay we don't want to do that all right
so here we'll get there here's the next

622
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
so here we'll get there here's the next
 

623
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,990
so here we'll get there here's the next
progression okay so he would

624
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
progression okay so he would
 

625
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,750
progression okay so he would
be more out

626
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:22,760
be more out
 

627
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,430
be more out
here right he's outside of my Yin Yong

628
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
here right he's outside of my Yin Yong
 

629
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,510
here right he's outside of my Yin Yong
lung and his energies go on that way

630
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
lung and his energies go on that way
 

631
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,830
lung and his energies go on that way
right okay so as I do that

632
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:36,840
right okay so as I do that
 

633
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,070
right okay so as I do that
same spiral that we had before we're

634
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,080
same spiral that we had before we're
 

635
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,870
same spiral that we had before we're
going to take him

636
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880

 

637
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,070

backwards okay cuz we're not in the same

638
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
backwards okay cuz we're not in the same
 

639
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,310
backwards okay cuz we're not in the same
place you see that but I do the same

640
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
place you see that but I do the same
 

641
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,470
place you see that but I do the same
movement

changes what we're doing

654
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,600

 

655
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,630

you can add your CLA to this whole

656
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640

 

657
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,950

thing okay but he's going that way even

658
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
thing okay but he's going that way even
 

659
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,630
thing okay but he's going that way even
though I'm doing something that

originally brought him this way and went
 

663
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,390
originally brought him this way and went
me under it okay so let's

664
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400

 

665
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,350

way feeling that
 

775
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,870
way feeling that
momentum he's going around that way if I

776
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
momentum he's going around that way if I
 

777
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,230
momentum he's going around that way if I
do that hand work it it should keep

778
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240

transference of that man going still
 

799
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,549
transference of that man going still
going behind me still going around but

800
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
going behind me still going around but
 

801
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,029
going behind me still going around but
he's going up like my hands are going up

802
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
he's going up like my hands are going up
 

803
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,549
he's going up like my hands are going up
but he's actually going that way okay

804
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
but he's actually going that way okay
 

805
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,149
but he's actually going that way okay
but if you pay attention in the

806
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
but if you pay attention in the
 

807
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,389
but if you pay attention in the
technique youd have his balance and then

808
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:14,399
technique youd have his balance and then
 

809
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,230
technique youd have his balance and then
you brought them back out of balance and

810
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
you brought them back out of balance and
 

811
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,630
you brought them back out of balance and
we're not going to do that what we do

812
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
we're not going to do that what we do
 

813
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,830
we're not going to do that what we do
instead in the technique is I drop

814
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:20,840
instead in the technique is I drop
 

815
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,310
instead in the technique is I drop
underneath all of that okay so as he got

816

underneath all of that okay so as he got
 

817
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,990
underneath all of that okay so as he got
is that loop I dropped underneath
