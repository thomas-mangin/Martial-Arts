72
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
can't just go in
 

73
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,510
can't just go in
but that's what i should take from the

74
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
but that's what i should take from the
 

75
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,830
but that's what i should take from the
sword i should say

sword i should say
 

77
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,670
sword i should say
since he actually

78
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
since he actually
 

79
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,510
since he actually
he actually went round the circle didn't

80
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
he actually went round the circle didn't
 

81
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,190
he actually went round the circle didn't
he

82
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
he
 

83
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,030
he
and then when it got to a certain point

84
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
and then when it got to a certain point
 

85
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,670
and then when it got to a certain point
with this person

86
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
with this person
 

87
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,749
with this person
he went in now i know you don't see the

88
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
he went in now i know you don't see the
 

89
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,270
he went in now i know you don't see the
whole you don't see the whole picture

90
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
whole you don't see the whole picture
 

91
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,310
whole you don't see the whole picture
of this

92
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320

 

93
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,950

but you see the start of it and that's

94
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
but you see the start of it and that's
 

95
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,510
but you see the start of it and that's
where

96
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
where
 

97
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,309
where
it's not a party piece this

98
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
it's not a party piece this
 

99
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,110
it's not a party piece this
it's to show you that that

100
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
it's to show you that that
 

101
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,390
it's to show you that that
movement

102
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
movement
 

103
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,229
movement
is

104
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
is
 

105
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,229
is
the righto dory

106
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
the righto dory
 

107
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,750
the righto dory
movement

108
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760

 

109
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,710

so if i do it like that i still can't go

110
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
so if i do it like that i still can't go
 

111
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,790
so if i do it like that i still can't go
in halfway through the circle

112
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
in halfway through the circle
 

113
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,589
in halfway through the circle
so i teach it like this so you've got

114
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
so i teach it like this so you've got
 

115
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,710
so i teach it like this so you've got
room

116
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
room
 

117
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,910
room
to drop it right out here this circle

118
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
to drop it right out here this circle
 

119
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,030
to drop it right out here this circle
right out here this circle

120
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040

 

121
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,229

and then

122
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
and then
 

123
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,910
and then
it teaches you techniques

124
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920

 

125
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,790

so so and what i discovered when i was

126
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
so so and what i discovered when i was
 

127
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,309
so so and what i discovered when i was
searching for this was

128
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
searching for this was
 

129
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,869
searching for this was
i was going into quick because i wanted

130
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
i was going into quick because i wanted
 

131
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,790
i was going into quick because i wanted
to do the technique

132
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
to do the technique
 

133
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,670
to do the technique
so so the more you can make this

134
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
so so the more you can make this
 

135
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,509
so so the more you can make this
circumference

136
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
circumference
 

137
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,630
circumference
the longer you can make it

138
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
the longer you can make it
 

139
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,309
the longer you can make it
and then what happens i'll tell you the

140
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
and then what happens i'll tell you the
 

141
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,550
and then what happens i'll tell you the
next stage what happens the next thing

142
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
next stage what happens the next thing
 

143
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,470
next stage what happens the next thing
what happens is you start making this

144
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
what happens is you start making this
 

145
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,990
what happens is you start making this
thing you go

146
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
thing you go
 

147
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,869
thing you go
oh i can feel it now i can feel it now

148
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
oh i can feel it now i can feel it now
 

149
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,949
oh i can feel it now i can feel it now
and then you you're too low and you go i

150
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
and then you you're too low and you go i
 

151
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,630
and then you you're too low and you go i
can't get in now

152
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
can't get in now
 

153
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,949
can't get in now

it so much
you've gone past the point

158
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
you've gone past the point
 

159
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,430
you've gone past the point
so there's a point that you're gonna

160
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
so there's a point that you're gonna
 

161
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,630
so there's a point that you're gonna
you're gonna have to look out for you're

you're gonna have to look out for you're
gonna have to go

164
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319

 

165
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,710

right so now my eyes are open

166
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
right so now my eyes are open

i'm just about in line with his elbow

168
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
i'm just about in line with his elbow
 

169
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,949
i'm just about in line with his elbow
that means i can get under it

170
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
that means i can get under it
 

171
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,470
that means i can get under it
when i move in
