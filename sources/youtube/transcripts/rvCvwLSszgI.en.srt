00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,829

so let's tie

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:03,839
so let's tie
 

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,669
so let's tie
um some of the drills together okay so

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:08,679
um some of the drills together okay so
 

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,549
um some of the drills together okay so
for

6
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
for
 

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,709
for
example if we take the early drills in

8
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:13,719
example if we take the early drills in
 

9
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,590
example if we take the early drills in
the C cultivation

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,600
the C cultivation
 

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,230
the C cultivation
set his young aspect I'm learning to

12
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
set his young aspect I'm learning to
 

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,589
set his young aspect I'm learning to
stop it from going straight over my

14
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:24,599

 

15
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,029

shoulder internalize it and bring it

16
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,039
shoulder internalize it and bring it
 

17
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,230
shoulder internalize it and bring it
down to that CR on the back in the Drone

18
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,240
down to that CR on the back in the Drone
 

19
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,910
down to that CR on the back in the Drone
okay in the back foot in the Drone so

20
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
okay in the back foot in the Drone so
 

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,750
okay in the back foot in the Drone so
he's pushing if I if I lose that

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:36,760
he's pushing if I if I lose that
 

23
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,069
he's pushing if I if I lose that
connection it'll go it'll knock me

24
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
connection it'll go it'll knock me
 

25
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,110
connection it'll go it'll knock me
over okay so he's

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
over okay so he's
 

27
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,830
over okay so he's
using this tactic of spinal displacement

28
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:46,840
using this tactic of spinal displacement
 

29
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,069
using this tactic of spinal displacement
but I'm using it for energetic

30
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
but I'm using it for energetic
 

31
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,670
but I'm using it for energetic
development

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680

 

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,549

okay to do that my whole body itself has

34
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,559
okay to do that my whole body itself has
 

35
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,789
okay to do that my whole body itself has
to be grounded so yes he we have a

36
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
to be grounded so yes he we have a
 

37
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,749
to be grounded so yes he we have a
horizontal young aspect but my flesh

38
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:11,759
horizontal young aspect but my flesh
 

39
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,630
horizontal young aspect but my flesh
descending is already that okay so when

40
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:15,640
descending is already that okay so when
 

41
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,469
descending is already that okay so when
I

42
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
I
 

43
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,749
I
start he's already hided he's already

44
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
start he's already hided he's already
 

45
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,149
start he's already hided he's already
hit

46
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:21,159
hit
 

47
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,390
hit
grounded young do you do you understand

48
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
grounded young do you do you understand
 

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,270
grounded young do you do you understand
that okay it's not that I'm here like

50
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
that okay it's not that I'm here like
 

51
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,590
that okay it's not that I'm here like
that and then I try to I try to find

52
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
that and then I try to I try to find
 

53
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,910
that and then I try to I try to find
that

54
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:30,920
that
 

55
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,590
that
okay so

56
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
okay so
 

57
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,190
okay so
um this is why for

58
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
um this is why for
 

59
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,389
um this is why for
example um if he climbs up the arm in

60
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:40,399
example um if he climbs up the arm in
 

61
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,910
example um if he climbs up the arm in
another drill that we've done it doesn't

62
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:42,920
another drill that we've done it doesn't
 

63
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,789
another drill that we've done it doesn't
doesn't change anything he keeps

64
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
doesn't change anything he keeps
 

65
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,670
doesn't change anything he keeps
climbing it doesn't change anything

66
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
climbing it doesn't change anything
 

67
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,149
climbing it doesn't change anything
because of I had

68
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,159
because of I had
 

69
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,069
because of I had
already vectored or internalized

70
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
already vectored or internalized
 

71
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,310
already vectored or internalized
or did an Alchemy on my body so that

72
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
or did an Alchemy on my body so that
 

73
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,550
or did an Alchemy on my body so that
doesn't change change anything at all

74
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,560
doesn't change change anything at all
 

75
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,109
doesn't change change anything at all
okay we know

76
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:06,119
okay we know
 

77
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,869
okay we know
also that's why it doesn't matter

78
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
also that's why it doesn't matter
 

79
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,390
also that's why it doesn't matter
whether you're on one foot or you or you

169
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,189
this a lot it's wrong okay
um in the same way that when he was

170
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
um in the same way that when he was
 

171
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,629
um in the same way that when he was
pushing all parts of my body are ground

172
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:39,639
pushing all parts of my body are ground
 

173
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,390
pushing all parts of my body are ground
vectoring okay so uh my hand is my elbow

174
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
vectoring okay so uh my hand is my elbow
 

175
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,469
vectoring okay so uh my hand is my elbow
is my shoulder is that's why he can't

176
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
is my shoulder is that's why he can't
 

177
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,230
is my shoulder is that's why he can't
push it over it's already going down

178
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
push it over it's already going down
 

179
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,230
push it over it's already going down
okay um so

180
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,240
okay um so
 

181
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,629
okay um so
likewise when I'm

182
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
likewise when I'm
 

183
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,189
likewise when I'm
here everything is going down it's the

184
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
here everything is going down it's the
 

185
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,710
here everything is going down it's the
same releasing drill I always do which

186
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
same releasing drill I always do which
 

187
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,510
same releasing drill I always do which
is why when I was in this stance he

188
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
is why when I was in this stance he
 

189
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,350
is why when I was in this stance he
still couldn't push me over it's already

190
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,360
still couldn't push me over it's already
 

191
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,390
still couldn't push me over it's already
being

192
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,400
being
 

193
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,390
being
grounded

194
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,400

 

195
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,629

okay when I come and I add the sword to

196
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
okay when I come and I add the sword to
 

197
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,510
okay when I come and I add the sword to
it or I add my hand placement to it the

198
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,520
it or I add my hand placement to it the
 

199
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,309
it or I add my hand placement to it the
sword itself is now part of that midfoot

200
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:25,319
sword itself is now part of that midfoot
 

201
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,029
sword itself is now part of that midfoot
grounding that's what I'm doing

202
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,039

 

203
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,230

to let my

204
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
to let my
 

205
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,430
to let my
hands uh take full advantage of The

206
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,440
hands uh take full advantage of The
 

207
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,870
hands uh take full advantage of The
Descent of the cut in

208
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:39,880
Descent of the cut in
 

209
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,150
Descent of the cut in
shanin they have to freely drop so I

210
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
shanin they have to freely drop so I
 

211
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,909
shanin they have to freely drop so I
don't want to hang them up

212
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
don't want to hang them up
 

213
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,629
don't want to hang them up
anymore this this would be

214
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
anymore this this would be
 

215
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,390
anymore this this would be
wrong but this is wrong too because my

216
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
wrong but this is wrong too because my
 

217
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,110
wrong but this is wrong too because my
hands can still freely drop if I release

218
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,120
hands can still freely drop if I release
 

219
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,070
hands can still freely drop if I release
where do they stop where they hit

220
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
where do they stop where they hit
 

221
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,309
where do they stop where they hit
they're going to hit your body

222
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
they're going to hit your body
 

223
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,110
they're going to hit your body
so if you look at it just in terms of

224
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,120
so if you look at it just in terms of
 

225
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,469
so if you look at it just in terms of
architecture the sword has to be in the

226
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
architecture the sword has to be in the
 

227
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,550
architecture the sword has to be in the
middle of my body for

228
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
middle of my body for
 

229
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,309
middle of my body for
Shi

230
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:11,319
Shi
 

231
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,790
Shi
okay and then my hands have to release

232
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
okay and then my hands have to release
 

233
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,150
okay and then my hands have to release
all the way because my shoulders will

234
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,160
all the way because my shoulders will
 

235
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,390
all the way because my shoulders will
release they'll descend my elbows will

236
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
release they'll descend my elbows will
 

237
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,430
release they'll descend my elbows will
descend and my hands and wrists will

238
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
descend and my hands and wrists will
 

239
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,950
descend and my hands and wrists will
descend and so this is where the cut

240
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
descend and so this is where the cut
 

241
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,990
descend and so this is where the cut
ends this is incorrect

242
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
ends this is incorrect
 

243
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,430
ends this is incorrect
this is incorrect there's still more to

244
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,440
this is incorrect there's still more to
 

245
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,230
this is incorrect there's still more to
draw okay so this is the bottom

246
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,240

 

247
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,469

part when I come up all I want to do is

248
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:43,479
part when I come up all I want to do is
 

249
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,270
part when I come up all I want to do is
correlate or

250
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,280
correlate or
 

251
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,670
correlate or
connect or utilize the dropping and

252
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:50,680
connect or utilize the dropping and
 

253
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,870
connect or utilize the dropping and
raising of my center of

254
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
raising of my center of
 

255
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,670
raising of my center of
gravity with the chi dropping and

256
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
gravity with the chi dropping and
 

257
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,670
gravity with the chi dropping and
raising

258
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
raising
 

259
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,350
raising
so I don't have to do this much rise and

260
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,360
so I don't have to do this much rise and
 

261
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,150
so I don't have to do this much rise and
descent to have that happen so for

262
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,160
descent to have that happen so for
 

263
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,510
descent to have that happen so for
example with no movement in my Center in

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:10,520
example with no movement in my Center in
 

265
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,670
example with no movement in my Center in

266
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
my center of gravity itself as I lift
 

267
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,909
my center of gravity itself as I lift
the sword my center of gravity is coming

268
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:16,919
the sword my center of gravity is coming
 

269
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,629
the sword my center of gravity is coming
up hence you can do a lot of exercises

270
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
up hence you can do a lot of exercises
 

271
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,869
up hence you can do a lot of exercises
with no movement at all I lift the

272
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:22,879
with no movement at all I lift the
 

273
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,670
with no movement at all I lift the

the midfoot I'm lifting it from the

284
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
the midfoot I'm lifting it from the
 

285
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,149
the midfoot I'm lifting it from the
midfoot just like I lift UK at the end

286
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:44,159
midfoot just like I lift UK at the end
 

287
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,029

of it of my wrist and grabbing on it
 

289
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,469
of it of my wrist and grabbing on it
goes through the midfoot my own flesh

290
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:49,479
goes through the midfoot my own flesh
 

291
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,909
goes through the midfoot my own flesh
goes through the midfoot the sword

292
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
goes through the midfoot the sword
 

293
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,869
goes through the midfoot the sword
everything goes through the midfoot and

294
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:53,879
everything goes through the midfoot and
 

295
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,430
everything goes through the midfoot and
as it comes up the center of gravity

296
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
as it comes up the center of gravity
 

297
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,270
as it comes up the center of gravity
Rises and as it comes down down the

298
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,280
Rises and as it comes down down the
 

299
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,950
Rises and as it comes down down the
center of gravity drops and I'm using

300
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:03,960
center of gravity drops and I'm using
 

301
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,230
center of gravity drops and I'm using
all of this the chi to the center of

302

gravity going up and
 

305
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,790
gravity going up and
down my legs then all I want to do is

306
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:13,800
down my legs then all I want to do is
 

307
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,550
down my legs then all I want to do is
assist slightly in that

308
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
assist slightly in that
 

309
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,189
assist slightly in that
process so as I come up there is a

310
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
process so as I come up there is a
 

311
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,189
process so as I come up there is a
slight

312
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
slight

314
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:24,759
pressing
 

315
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,830
pressing
into the increased yangong energy from

316
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
into the increased yangong energy from
 

317
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,270
into the increased yangong energy from
pulling the bulk in away from the earth

318
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
pulling the bulk in away from the earth
 

319
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,110
pulling the bulk in away from the earth
so I I lift the sword up with that

320
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
so I I lift the sword up with that
 

321
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,750
so I I lift the sword up with that
