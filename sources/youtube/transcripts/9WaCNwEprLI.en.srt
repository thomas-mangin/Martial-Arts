demand of ricotta
 

447
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,269
demand of ricotta
so that brings us to the the kettle and

448
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
so that brings us to the the kettle and
 

449
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,829
so that brings us to the the kettle and
the water

450
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
the water
 

451
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,310
the water
you'll see now because it's a glass

452
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
you'll see now because it's a glass
 

453
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,509

cattle
 

455
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,829
cattle
you'll see how it's starting to

456
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839

 

457
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,870

get warm

458
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
get warm
 

459
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,190
get warm
and about now is the time i should be

460
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
and about now is the time i should be
 

461
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,710
and about now is the time i should be
making the pour of that water

462
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720

 

463
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,030

if i just leave it because it's friendly

if i just leave it because it's friendly
 

465
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,670
if i just leave it because it's friendly
i think i look at the water friendly

466
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
i think i look at the water friendly
 

467
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,310
i think i look at the water friendly
now it's starting to get

469
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,350

angry can you say the way it's getting

470
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
angry can you say the way it's getting
 

471
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,710
angry can you say the way it's getting
angrier and angrier you could say more

472
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
angrier and angrier you could say more
 

473

it's changing now whatever you think
 

477
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,949
it's changing now whatever you think
let's

478
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
let's
 

479
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,069
let's
say go with my theory that if i poured

480
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
say go with my theory that if i poured
 

481
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,190
say go with my theory that if i poured
that water

482
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
that water
 

483
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,790
that water
while it was in the angry states

484
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
while it was in the angry states
 

485
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,829
while it was in the angry states
if the water crystals change with how i

486
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
if the water crystals change with how i
 

487
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,990
if the water crystals change with how i
feel would i change

488
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
feel would i change
 

489
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,350
feel would i change
with how the water feels

490
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
with how the water feels
 

491
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,269
